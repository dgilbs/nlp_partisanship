Source: 2014 Senate campaign website, www.SasseForNebraska.com Mar 18, 2014 On Homeland Security: Spend to maintain the greatest fighting force the world The primary role of the Federal Government is to protect our citizens from enemies foreign and domestic.

Source: 2014 Senate campaign website, www.SasseForNebraska.com Mar 18, 2014 On Immigration: Neither party has gotten serious about border security The Federal Government\\'s primary responsibility is to protect Americans from enemies foreign and domestic. The American people are not safe unless we know who is entering and leaving our country. Neither Party has been willing to get serious about border security, dating back to the mid-80s when a Republican president agreed to amnesty in exchange for promises of securing the border later. It never happened. President \"You can keep your doctor\" Obama refuses to lead on this issue because he is more concerned about turning Texas into a Democrat state than he is about solving the problem.

Source: 2014 Senate campaign website, SasseForNebraska.com, \"Issues\" Nov 14, 2013 On Budget & Economy: Reform entitlement programs & live within our means Government should be promoting prosperity, protecting property, and practicing frugality, rather than spawning dependency, redistributing wealth, and spending recklessly. What does this mean? Longstanding and essential entitlement programs should be reformed and thereby preserved, while unaffordable, new entitlement programs must be repealed. Government should live within its means and should not unfairly shackle one generation with the debts of another. Source: 2014 Senate campaign website, SasseForNebraska.com, \"Issues\" Nov 14, 2013 On Civil Rights: Don\\'t redefine one-man-one-woman marriage Strong marriages, traditional families, and local communities are critical to the well-being of any civilization--and especially to a republic. What does this mean? Marriage, the union of one man and one woman, is the fundamental building block of society and should be respected and strengthened, not redefined. At a time of rising out-of-wedlock births, resulting in the physical and spiritual impoverishment of the young, government should not create incentives against marriage.

As President George W. Bush\\'s Assistant Secretary of Health, during my time at HHS, I learned A LOT about health care. I\\'ve spent the better part of the last ten years in the health care sector, and I have intensely studied ObamaCare. The fact is, I\\'m one of the few people it seems who has actually read the 2,300 pages of ObamaCare, and let me just tell you--it\\'s worse than you think. I understand the bill, I can explain the bill, and I know how to rip it apart. The problem with ObamaCare goes way beyond technological glitches. The problem with ObamaCare is that it fundamentally changes the relationship between the Government and our citizens. [We should] repeal ObamaCare and get America back on track.

What does this mean? American leadership and global preeminence are essential to advancing our nation\\'s interests and values, and we must maintain a security posture and military and counter-terrorism budgets sufficient to ensure peace through strength and to deter all competitors. America is defined by a belief in universal values grounded in human dignity and liberty, and by simultaneous commitments to promoting religious freedom, human rights, and democracy, and to prudential skepticism of unnecessary military entanglements. America is faithful in our commitments to allies, who need to know that the US is a reliable friend who will not sacrifice them for the sake of expediency. American sovereignty undergirds international legal commitments, & multilateralism is a pragmatic tool to advance our national interests, rather than an end in itself.

Taxation should be as simple as possible and should not exceed historical norms, as the federal government should shrink--not expand--in size and scope. Regulations should not sap the vitality of a free citizenry, stymy economic growth, or disadvantage everyday Americans at the expense of the well-connected.

What does this mean? Churches, charities, civil associations--these are the lifeblood of society and the chief protection against the extremes of isolated individualism and all-encompassing statism. Government should focus on promoting the conditions in which individuals, families, and local communities can pursue happiness and thrive, not on creating the communities, guaranteeing happiness, or equalizing outcomes. Government does not exist to solve every problem, could not do so if it tried, and often undermines freedom even when it succeeds--and thus should tread lightly in domestic and economic matters. Nothing can match the creativity and responsiveness of the private sector, and products and services do not become more efficient by being more heavily regulated.

It is critical to the fight to create good-paying jobs and strengthen the middle class. \"The \"Bring Jobs Home Act\\' is a commendable proposal that deserves broad bipartisan support. It would end taxpayer-funded subsidies for job exporters while providing tax credits for companies that move jobs and business activities from another country to the United States.

The United States should continue to play a supportive role by providing useful intelligence.\" Source: 2014 Kentucky Senate campaign website, AlisonForKentucky.com Jun 13, 2014 On Crime: One in six US women will be victims of domestic violence PROTECTING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: As Secretary of State, Alison championed the first-ever address confidentiality program for victims of domestic violence to ensure their safety and security are not compromised when they vote. In the Senate, Alison will continue to be a voice for victims of domestic violence. According to the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, \"a woman is assaulted every 15 seconds\" and one in six women in the U.S. will be victims of domestic violence over the course of her lifetime--troubling statistics that must be addressed. Despite political attempts to disguise his real record, Mitch McConnell has repeatedly opposed the Violence Against Women Act and even blocked an effort to vote on the bill to protect women.

Education is the passport out of poverty, and every child has the right to a quality education. A good education is an economic necessity and should not be a luxury. Education is the gateway to good-paying jobs, economic growth and a strong middle class. Mitch McConnell negotiated a Washington budget deal that caused 1,100 Kentucky children to lose access to early childhood education and cut an estimated $31.8 million from Kentucky schools. He also opposed legislation to hire and preserve jobs for teachers and blocked legislation to preserve low interest rates for students. Source: 2014 Senate campaign website AlisonForKentucky.com \"Issues\" Feb 3, 2014 On Jobs: Increase the minimum wage to a living wage In order to grow our middle class, we must raise the minimum wage to help hardworking Americans achieve a basic standard of living. 2/3 of minimum wage workers in the US are women. Consider a single working mother of two who makes the current federal minimum wage who brings home just $14,500 annually--nearly $4,000 below the poverty line. Rather than forcing our own neighbors to choose between putting food on the table, getting to work and paying the rent, all Americans deserve a living wage that is consistent with our values. Raising the minimum wage would increase incomes for more than 30 million US workers, and is an important step to ensure workers see the benefits of a growing economy. Doing so would: Lift the wages of over one in four Kentucky workers. Increase annual earnings for the nearly 30 percent of Kentuckians who make minimum wage or just above by $2,369 on average and $863 million in total. Grow Kentucky\\'s GDP by $546 million by 2015 and create 2,200 jobs. Source: 2014 Senate campaign website AlisonForKentucky.com \"Issues\" Feb 3, 2014 On Civil Rights: Fight for pay equity for women Just as she has throughout her life, Alison Lundergan Grimes will continue fighting for women as Kentucky\\'s first female United States Senator. ACHIEVING PAY EQUITY: Women are half of the labor force in this country yet still make 77 cents for every dollar--23% less than their male counterparts. In Kentucky, women lose nearly $5 billion in wages each year--a statistic that is staggering and unacceptable. With that money a working woman in Kentucky could purchase 78 more weeks of groceries, pay 14 more months of rent, make 8 more months of mortgage and utilities payments or buy 2,477 additional gallons of gas. In contrast, Mitch McConnell has called equal pay for equal work just another \"special interest vote\" and voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act--not once, but twice. Source: 2014 Senate campaign website, AlisonForKentucky.com \"Issues\" Nov 8, 2013 On Gun Control: Proud of long-held sporting & hunting traditions Today Alison Lundergan Grimes released the following statement: \"As an NRA member, my strong support for the Second Amendment is unquestioned. I am proud of Kentucky\\'s long-held gun ownership, sporting and hunting traditions. It is unfortunate that Senator McConnell is desperate to mislead Kentucky voters about my strong support for the Second Amendment. As an NRA member, my strong support for the Second Amendment is unquestioned. I am proud of Kentucky\\'s long-held gun ownership, sporting and hunting traditions. It is unfortunate that Senator McConnell is desperate to mislead Kentucky voters about my strong support for the Second Amendment. In the Senate, I will protect my fellow Kentuckians\\' right to keep and bear arms. Whenever he\\'s not busy pandering to Washington lobbyists, I welcome Senator McConnell to come shoot with me at the range any day.\" Source: 2014 Senate campaign website, AlisonForKentucky.com, P/R Nov 8, 2013 On Homeland Security: Reduce veterans\\' services backlog; support new vets jobs law Washington has fallen short of honoring our commitment to our veterans. Our veterans should not struggle to find jobs or access care. Kentucky is the home of over 350,000 veterans, the fourth largest in the nation. It is a disgrace that so many veterans across Kentucky have compensation claims pending, more than 10,000 in the Louisville VA backlog alone. I\\'m shocked that Mitch McConnell opposed plans to reduce this backlog and voted against veterans jobs legislation. This is wrong. I\\'m committed to serving Kentucky\\'s 350,000 veterans and I will fight for the quality health care, benefits and treatment they have earned. We must expand education and training opportunities for service members and veterans, facilitating public/private partnerships that help them translate their military skills for the civilian workforce. We must improve access to health care services, including mental health, prosthetic care and wound regeneration.

       "\"Jobs & The Economy\\nBoosting the Economy and Cutting Deficits\\nThe Obama Administration has failed to get the economy moving forward, resulting in one of the weakest recoveries from a recession in our nation’s history. Millions of Americans can’t find work.\\nWith a debt of over $17 trillion – over $54,000 per U.S. citizen – and counting, Congress cannot continue to mortgage our children’s future. It’s reckless and irresponsible. We must enact sound fiscal policy that promotes innovation and job growth, reigns in federal spending, and reforms the tax code.\\n  Improving Lives and Opportunities in Rural Alaska\\nNative and rural communities are the foundation of our state. They are a storied part of Alaska’s past and a vital component of our future.\\nDan has a deep respect for rural Alaska, its people and their rich culture and traditions. He continues the time-honored activities of his wife Julie’s family at their fish camp on the Yukon River. And through his work as Attorney General and Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources, Dan has had the opportunity to focus on many challenges and opportunities facing rural Alaska.\\nAs your U.S. Senator, Dan will continue to work to improve the lives and opportunities for rural Alaskans by reducing the high costs of energy, increasing economic opportunities, providing better access to healthcare, and protecting families through improved law enforcement and other measures.\\n  Promoting Alaska’s Arctic\\nThe United States is an Arctic nation because of Alaska. Therefore, the state should be at the forefront of shaping Arctic policy. Instead, the Obama Administration has too often left Alaska out of federal decisions affecting its lands and its people.\\nAs Alaska’s Attorney General and Commissioner of Natural Resources, Dan fought to get Alaska a seat at the table, consistently reminding the Obama Administration that with regard to the Arctic, Alaska is the other sovereign at the table, not just another stakeholder. And as U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Energy, Economics and Business, he worked to promote the nation’s role in the Arctic – from both an energy and national security perspective – on the international stage.\\nResponsibly developing our Arctic resources will promote our nation's interests by securing a politically stable, long-term supply of domestic energy; boosting U.S. economic growth and jobs; reducing the federal trade deficit; and strengthening our global leadership on energy issues.\\n Rural Alaska\\nRural Alaska\\nDan discovered his love for Alaska through his wife, Julie Fate, by experiencing her family’s fish camp on the Yukon River. Julie is the daughter of Mary Jane and Bud Fate of Fairbanks. He continues to practice the values he learned over the years through the time-honored tradition of putting away and sharing fish. It is these cultural values that Dan and Julie continue to instill in their three daughters, where grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins play an important role.\\nDan respects that for our rural communities to be healthy and safe, strong and vibrant, our Alaska Native languages must be restored and subsistence hunting and fishing must be protected. Dan is committed to addressing the tough challenges in our State: the failed management of subsistence resources, village public safety, the high cost of living, and infrastructure investment. Dan is a proven leader in bringing Alaskans together to address our toughest challenges.\\nAs our next U.S. Senator, Dan will uphold the government-to-government relationship between the United States and Indian tribes. Dan stands ready to usher in a new era economic self-determination in our villages by supporting strong governments and strong Native corporations. Further, he will continue to foster cooperative relationships among Alaska Native organizations for the benefit of Alaska Native communities.\\nAs your US Senator, Dan Sullivan will:\\nFoster healthy and safe communities\\nExpand infrastructure in Rural Alaska\\nHonor our commitment to Veterans\\nAddress domestic violence and Sexual Assault\\nJobs & Infrastructure\\nTo jump-start our village economies we must better coordinate federal investments in rural Alaska and breathe new life into the Denali Commission. Regulations and red tape can no long delay sewer and water projects, housing construction, energy projects, and job creation activities in our rural communities. Dan will focus on reducing the high cost of living through the aggressive planning and support of energy and transportation networks in our rural regions. The high cost of construction must be reduced to alleviate the housing and energy crisis in our rural communities. As Chair of the Governor's Rural Action Subcabinet he spearheaded the first State-Tribal transportation agreements to address infrastructure challenges.\\nDan will prioritize workforce preparedness and job creation activities. Whether its the manufacturing of commercial fishing boats in Emmonak, mine activity in the Northwest Arctic, or filling the thousands of jobs provided by our Native corporations, regional tribal organizations, and local school districts, Dan will aggressively support putting local people in local jobs.\\nAs your US Senator, Dan stands ready to:\\nEnhance tribal workforce preparedness and job creation activities.\\nReduce government contracting barriers for Native corporations.\\nGrowing a workforce of Native teachers, Native health care providers, and Native aviators.\\nProtecting Alaskans\\nThe rates of domestic and sexual violence in Alaska demand a leader that doesn’t play politics. It’s time our State and Tribes partnered in the protection of our communities. Restorative justice must be incorporated to heal our communities. A new era of tri-lateral coordination and cooperation between Tribes, State Government and the Federal Government is necessary and urgent to protect Alaskans. As Co-Chair of the Alaska Rural Justice and Law Enforcement Commission and Attorney General of the State of Alaska, Dan put more VPSOs in villages, and increased sentences for sexual assault crimes.\\nAs your US Senator, Dan stands ready to support:\\nTribal court operational and capacity development.\\nVillage law enforcement and public safety equipment funding.\\nSupport for tribal health providers in responding to domestic violence and sexual assault.Healthcare\\nPromoting Affordable Healthcare while Fighting ObamaCare\\nAccess to affordable and quality healthcare is an extremely important issue to Alaskans, and it is critical for policy makers to achieve that goal. At the same time, we must revive our national economy and rein in the trillions of dollars of deficits that the Obama Administration has run over the past five years.\\nPresident Obama and Senator Begich have fundamentally changed the American healthcare system for the worse through ObamaCare. Now, as a result of Begich’s decision to cast the deciding vote for ObamaCare, Alaskans are losing their healthcare and facing skyrocketing premiums.\\nObamaCare spends trillions of dollars we don’t have, while commandeering one-sixth of our nation’s economy. It also hurts Alaskans by raising taxes on them, escalating insurance premiums, forcing employers to drop coverage and putting the government in between them and their doctor.\\nAs Alaska’s Attorney General, Dan sued to stop ObamaCare. He will continue that fight as your U.S. Senator. It is time to repeal and replace ObamaCare and empower Alaskans to make their own healthcare decisions, not the federal government.\\nClick here to read Dan's legal brief on ObamaCare.2nd Amendment\\nDefending Our Second Amendment Rights\\nAs a Marine-qualified “expert” on the rifle and pistol, Dan is a strong advocate and defender of our Second Amendment rights. Americans are protected by the Constitution to keep and bear arms. However, President Obama and Senate Democrats have taken steps to infringe on those rights, and they must be stopped.\\nMany Alaskans depend on their firearms as a means of protection, hunting and recreation. Instead of infringing on Americans’ constitutional rights, we can work harder to enforce existing laws and keep guns out of the hands of those with mental illness.\\n Energy & Natural Resources\\nPromoting Responsible Development of Alaska’s Resources \\nGiven Alaska’s world-class resource base and strategic global location, our natural resource potential can lead America into a new era of economic prosperity. As Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources, Dan defended the state’s economic interests and worked with the private sector to maximize Alaska’s full economic potential. His work has focused on getting big things done for Alaska, and when necessary, aggressively fighting back against those who try to shutdown or delay economic opportunities for our citizens.\\nWe must take a proactive, results-based strategy to Washington by tackling energy issues at the federal level and capitalizing on the enormous opportunity for development here in Alaska and throughout the rest of the country.\\n Military & Veterans Affairs\\nHonoring Our Veterans\\nThe federal government has a sacred responsibility to provide for those who defend the nation, government, way of life, and Constitution each and every day. Dan feels strongly about this issue because he is a veteran himself – a 20-year infantry and reconnaissance Marine currently serving as the commanding officer of a U.S. Marine Corps Reserve ANGLICO unit.\\nAlaska has one the highest numbers of veterans per capita in the nation – over 77,000 strong. Many come to Alaska to serve at bases like Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Fort Greely, Eielson Air Force Base and Fort Wainwright, and after they complete their service or retire, they stay in Alaska. The state’s large veteran population is something communities across Alaska take great pride in.\\nAmerica’s veterans and their families have earned their benefits through hard work, dedication, and sometimes the ultimate sacrifice. In an era where trust in government has plummeted, there is no more important issue than keeping faith with our veterans.\\nDan is focused on this critical issue, and will work to safeguard and respect veterans in a special manner. His campaign’s first policy paper, launched on Veteran’s Day, is titled the “Promises Delivered Project” and lays out his vision for how we can better serve our nation’s veterans.\\nCLICK HERE to read Dan's “Promises Delivered Project”.\\n  Promoting a Strong, Smart National Defense\\nOn September 11, 2001, Americans witnessed the most horrific terrorist attacks on our nation’s soil. It was a reminder of the terrorist threats we face as a country. These threats have not ceased and we must ensure that we remain vigilant in the War on Terrorism.\\nDan has senior-level military, national security, foreign policy, and energy security experience through service to our country as a 20-year Marine Corps infantry officer and as a U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Energy, Economics and Business.\\nHe is committed to protecting our national security and providing our nation’s military men and women with the resources they need to do this.\\n Family Values\\nPromoting a Culture of Life and Parental Rights \\nBorn and raised a Roman Catholic, Dan believes in the sanctity of life. And as a father of three wonderful daughters, he knows there is no greater gift than being a parent. This responsibility, coupled with his faith and life experiences, has taught him that life begins at conception and we must fight to protect the lives of the unborn.\\nAs Attorney General, he worked hard to defend the constitutionality of Alaska’s Parental Notification Initiative Act, which promotes the rights and responsibilities of parents to be notified about major moral issues affecting their children, including those relating to possible abortions.\\n Federal Overreach\\nFighting the Obama Administration’s Overreach into Our Lives and Economy\\nAs both Alaska’s Attorney General and as Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources, Dan has fought the Obama Administration's dramatic expansion of the federal government into our lives.\\nThe President Obama-Mark Begich agenda undermines Alaska and America’s future. Dan will make rolling back their agenda his number one priority as Alaska’s U.S. Senator.\\nMany talk about fighting the Obama Administration, but Dan has been in the arena taking action against this unprecedented overreach.\\nFrom taking Alaska’s fight against ObamaCare to the U.S. Supreme Court to challenging the abusive authority of the Environmental Protection Agency, Dan has fought the Obama Administration every step of the way. Remember, the states created the federal government, not vice versa.\\n  Cutting Red Tape\\nStrong economic growth begins with reducing bureaucratic red tape, which is having crippling effects on job growth and small businesses across the country.\\nOverregulation is an issue that affects Alaskans and Americans every day, particularly in regard to permitting for responsible resource development projects, both small and large. Investors eyeing projects in Alaska and the Lower 48 hesitate to get involved because of the high risk for permitting delays and litigation. And when the Obama Administration discourages those investments and jobs through regulatory burdens, energy and mineral investment opportunities are lost to nations with substandard environmental regulations.\\nAs Commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources, Dan instituted a comprehensive strategy to reduce red tape and make the state’s permitting system more efficient, timely and certain. As a result, his department reduced a backlog of 2,500 state permits by 40 percent. The Alaska Legislature also passed numerous statutory changes to further improve the state’s permitting system while protecting the environment. This kind of leadership and experience in cutting red tape is needed in Washington.\""
