{"title": "In Response to ENR Field Hearing at Robbins Lumber, King Introduces Combined Heat and Power Support Act", "date": ["Thursday, November 16, 2017"], "release": "In response to input from leaders of the forest products industry at the October U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee field hearing at Robbins Lumber in Searsmont, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) today introduced the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Support Act, legislation that would help sustain and strengthen rural industries and create jobs by reauthorizing the CHP technical assistance partnership (TAP), which sunset in September of this year. The bill would also provide funding for the CHP TAP program for the next five years. CHP technology can efficiently leverage byproducts of the forest industry and turn them into added value for local economies, which would diversify energy options for rural industries, increase markets for forest products residuals, and maximize use of Maine\u2019s natural resources. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn Maine and throughout the country, lowering energy costs is essential to supporting rural industry and fostering job creation,\u201d  . \u201cAt Robbins Lumber in October, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, industry stakeholders, and representatives from the Department of Energy were able to see firsthand how innovative approaches to controlling energy costs can be good for business, and good for the health and vibrancy of the surrounding community. Maine sits on a goldmine of fiber, and by offering an array of strategies to Maine businesses, we can better manage energy usage and ensure our forest products sector is leveraging every inch of the tree \u2013 from stump to stem.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs we look to diversify and restore markets for full utilization of our forest resources, wood energy is an extremely important opportunity for Maine\u2019s loggers and truckers,\u201d  . \u201cThe DOE Technical Assistance program can provide important tools to assist Maine in expanding market opportunities for wood energy to make Maine more energy independent.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"Enabling biomass power facilities to sell the heat produced in generating electricity is the next frontier for our industry  \"We thank Senator King for fighting for this funding, which will go toward helping biomass facilities do the necessary upgrades to sell heat. This could boost not only biomass facilities, which face stiff competition in current power markets, but also the larger forest products industry in Maine and around the country.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Alliance for Industrial Efficiency applauds Senator King for his leadership in introducing legislation to authorize the Department of Energy\u2019s Combined Heat and Power Technical Partnership Program (\u201cCHP TAPs\u201d),\u201d   \u201cThe CHP TAPs and the supporting efforts of the DOE Advanced Manufacturing Office\u2019s Technical Assistance Partnerships save consumers money, increase economic competitiveness, strengthen our nation\u2019s energy security, and reduce harmful emissions through the use of CHP. By authorizing the continuation of the CHP TAPs, Senator King will help manufacturers, universities, and institutions save money, reduce their energy use, increase their reliability in the face of extreme weather events that may compromise the grid, and lower their emissions.\u201d Specifically, the CHP Support Act would authorize $12 million in funding for the CHP TAP program each year through Fiscal Year 2022. The CHP TAP program enables higher education research centers to provide assistance and analysis for any business looking to invest in CHP technology and has supported a wide-range of businesses throughout the country. In Maine, the program has helped multiple businesses install energy-efficient CHP equipment that has saved energy costs. Following Hurricane Maria, some of the only facilities with power in Puerto Rico were hospitals with on-site CHP technology. In early October, Senator King hosted a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee field hearing at Robbins Lumber, a fifth-generation family owned sawmill in Searsmont, to discuss how CHP and microgrid technology approaches can support rural industries and communities and to underscore the energy saving potential of colocation energy approaches. Robbins Lumber currently has a CHP facility under construction that will generate electricity and thermal energy\u00a0from wood waste produced in the region\u2019s logging operations and sawmills. The field hearing included witnesses from the Maine forest products and energy industries as well as the Director of the Advanced Manufacturing Office in the Department of Energy. Senator King has been a strong advocate for reducing energy costs and supporting job growth for Maine industry. The Economic Development Assessment Team (EDAT),  , recommended the development of markets for forest product residuals including low-value wood in CHP biomass plants, micro-grids, and modern thermal systems. In the EDAT report, the Department of Energy announced support through its CHP Technical Assistance Program to help Maine\u2019s forest industry with feasibility assessments of existing operations to install CHP technology as a strategy to lower costs through generating onsite power. Senator King has also introduced the  , bipartisan legislation that would establish a tax credit for business and home use of high-efficiency biomass heating equipment. Tax incentives already exist for other forms of renewable energy and this bill seeks to achieve parity between those renewable systems and thermal biomass systems.\u00a0 ###"},

{"title": "On Senate Floor, King Pushes for Funding of Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers", "date": ["Thursday, November 16, 2017"], "release": " \u2013 Today, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) spoke on the Senate floor about the importance of funding Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which provide vital health care services to rural communities. Seventy percent of federal funding for FQHCs expired on October 1 , threatening access to health care for tens of thousands of people in Maine. \u201cIn Maine, we have 20 centers, and 70 facilities scattered all over our state and they are providing services every day to over 200,000 people,\u201d  . \u201cThey\u2019ve saved Medicaid over $100 million in Maine. $257 million is the estimate for what they\u2019ve saved the overall health care system [in Maine]\u2026 One in six people in Maine get their health care from FQHC\u2019s. 210,000 people. They accept everybody that comes in the door, I\u2019ve been to them all over the state\u2026These are the rural health care providers for rural America. And it\u2019s not only Maine, it\u2019s across the country. 10,000 sites across the United States, 26 million patients at risk\u2026\u00a0 \u201cIf we leave at the end of the year and haven\u2019t done this, it will be a tragedy for rural America, it will be a betrayal of rural America, it will be betrayal of our constituents. All of us have been to these centers and seen the care that they provide \u2013 the caring that they provide \u2013 the passion that people bring to the services in their communities and how much they mean to their communities. This is one of the best federal programs ever created. And it\u2019s always been supported on a bipartisan basis.\u201d During his remarks, Senator King highlighted a recent letter from the leader of one of Maine\u2019s 20 FQHCs. The letter lays out the challenges FQHCs are already facing based on the uncertainty of funding: a dentist recruit, who had been trained by the center in question, had his application placed on hold, calling his future employment in the region into question. This dentist\u2019s presence is vital, as 3,000 community members are currently being served by a dentist who is planning to retire; based on uncertainty alone, thousands of people in Maine could be left without a viable option for dental care.\u00a0 Senator King\u2019s speech, which came on National Rural Health Day, is the latest example of his strong advocacy for increased support of rural health services. Last week, he   aimed at improving financial stability for rural hospitals and supporting seniors in rural Maine. He has also met with hospital administrators and health professionals in Bridgton, Lincoln, Skowhegan, Eastport and Machias to discuss the impact changes to the Affordable Care Act would have on rural Maine clinics, hospitals, patients, and local economies. Proposed cuts to health programs like Medicaid would significantly threaten the financial stability of rural hospitals which serve as one of the top employers in fifteen out of Maine\u2019s sixteen counties. Senator King has opposed several attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and has repeatedly called on his colleagues to engage in bipartisan discussions to make meaningful improvements to the law rather than rushing to repeal it. This summer, Senator King\u00a0 \u00a0to stabilize the health care marketplace and lower the underlying costs of treatment and health coverage for people in Maine and across the country. He is a cosponsor of the bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to stabilize the individual health insurance marketplace."},

Regardless of who is writing the check, the current trajectory of healthcare spending is unsustainable. We need to make the most of options like preventive care, which is proven to control costs and improve the overall health of communities. By ensuring that future Congressional Budget Office studies extend beyond the existing ten-year budget window, this bill will help us fully understand the long-term benefits and maximize the impact of preventive care to improve overall health, in Maine and across the country.\u201d \u201cThis bipartisan legislation is a simple fix that will allow the Congressional Budget Office to capture the long-term savings that can be achieved through preventive health care, arming lawmakers with more accurate information when considering legislation to improve health care system,\u201d  . \u201cPrevention and early detection through cancer screenings, counseling, and immunization all lower healthcare costs by reducing the severity of disease. As a nation, we spend far more on the treatment of disease than we do on preventive health. But our neglect of prevention has been costly, overwhelming our healthcare budgets, particularly Medicare and Medicaid,\u201d   \u201cRe-evaluating our budget rules is not a new phenomenon. As our nation shifts its focus to more preventive healthcare, our budgets and accounting methods should shift too.\u201d \u201cPreventive health care has been proven time and time again to save lives and dramatically lower costs, and that is an investment that is well worth making,\u201d  . \u201cThis bill will ensure that lawmakers have that information at their fingertips to help make better decisions about these programs in the future.\u201d \u201cThe Preventive Health Savings Act recognizes the importance of preventing chronic diseases and promoting behavioral health,\u201d   \u201cWe know that lifestyle support programs such as the National Diabetes Prevention Program lead to significant cost-savings that extend beyond the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s traditional scoring window of 10 years. Evaluating cost-savings further into the future, as would be allowed by the Preventive Health Savings Act, will provide a more comprehensive appraisal of critical programs that promote wellness and disease prevention, while reducing health care costs and overall spending, and thus improving the lives of millions of Americans.\u201d The American Diabetes Association is one of 120 organizations that have expressed support for the Preventative Health Savings Act. November is National Diabetes Awareness Month, and the disease is one of the leading chronic diseases causing death and disability in the United States. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), efforts to treat chronic diseases account for over 80 percent of America\u2019s health care costs. \u00a0Preventive care \u2013 such as health screenings, shots, and lab tests \u2013 can help prevent chronic disease and ultimately lead to savings in health care costs. Under current law, however, the CBO does not take into account the long-term cost-savings associated with preventive health initiatives.\u00a0 would direct the CBO to more accurately reflect the cost-savings of preventive health care legislation by allowing Congressional Committees \u2013 including the Budget; Health, Education, Labor and Pensions; Finance; Ways and Means; and Energy and Commerce Committees \u2013 to request an analysis of preventive measures extending beyond the existing 10-year budget window to two additional 10-year periods. By allowing the CBO to widen its budget window to better capture the costs-savings from preventive care, the legislation encourages a sensible review of health policy in order to promote public health and incentivizes Congress to invest in proven methods of saving lives and money.\u200e Senators King, Crapo and Cardin originally introduced the bill in 2013, and reintroduced the bill in 2016. ###"},

The hearing was held to receive testimony from outside experts on recommendations for a future National Defense Strategy. \u201cDefending the national security of the United States involves a continuum, it seems to me, that goes from diplomacy to war,\u201d  . \u201cWar is the most expensive and least desirable of those outcomes. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI think of Afghanistan. Our success there will ultimately depend upon the success of the government in Afghanistan to gain the confidence of its people. In Iraq, the relationship between the government of Iraq, and the Kurds, and the Sunni population is ultimately going to determine if Iraq is a successful state. North Korea, the solution to North Korea lies through diplomacy with China. I think everyone appreciates and understands that. The reason Iran is not North Korea today is because of the JCPOA, which was passed two years ago. Otherwise \u2013 according to the intelligence services \u2013 we would be dealing with an Iran with a nuclear weapon, today, about two years from when we passed that bill. Israel-Palestine, a major flashpoint for conflict in the Middle East, it\u2019s all about diplomacy.\u201d Senator King went on to discuss the issues with staffing at the U.S. Department of State, and highlighted the need to fill important posts at the department. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRight now, by the way, under the current dispensation, this part of the strategy \u2013 that is diplomacy \u2013 is being drastically downgraded, with budgets cut at the State Department,\u201d  . \u201cWe don\u2019t have an Ambassador to South Korea, for example, or even a nominee.\u201d The witnesses before this morning\u2019s hearing were Dr. Mara E.

{"title": "Ahead of Vote on Tax Reform, King Warns of Proposal\u2019s Dangerous Impact on National Debt", "date": ["Thursday, November 30, 2017"], "release": " Today, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) spoke on the Senate floor about the dangerous impact the Senate tax reform proposal would have on the national debt. Senator King\u2019s comments came during debate on an amendment he offered to refer the bill to committee with instructions to create a deficit-neutral proposal, which the Senate voted on tonight. His amendment was defeated by a vote of 48 to 52. \u201cOne of my concerns\u2026that I want to focus on today, and the background of my amendment which recommits and asks that the Committee come back with a deficit-neutral bill, is the debt and the deficit,\u201d  . \u201cIf you notice there\u2019s a pattern here\u2026the pattern is that when we get into major catastrophes \u2013 including war \u2013 that\u2019s when we have to borrow money\u2026this is why you preserve your borrowing power for when you actually need it\u2026 \u201cLook where we\u2019re headed \u2013 we\u2019re headed to a place where we aren\u2019t going to be able to sustain this debt. Everybody knows that, and yet the bill that we\u2019re voting on today expands the deficit by somewhere between half a trillion and two and a half trillion dollars, depending upon how it\u2019s all sorted out\u2026it\u2019s shameful, and it\u2019s going to come back to haunt us\u2026 \u201cNow I\u2019ve been around public life and politics for a long time, and I\u2019ve heard a lot about deficits, and people are concerned about deficits \u2013 until today! The deficit doesn\u2019t seem to be a big deal anymore. I predict that after this bill passes, within a couple of years when the deficits start to mount up, the same people who are voting for this bill today are going to say, \u2018Oh my goodness, we have these huge deficits, what are we going to do? I think we have to cut entitlements, we have to cut Social Security, we have to cut Medicare and certainly we have to cut all those domestic programs.\u2019 Well [Mr. President], I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right\u2026 \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is simply borrowing money from our children to give ourselves tax cuts. That\u2019s really the essence of what\u2019s going on here. If we were cutting taxes on a revenue-neutral basis, that would make sense\u2026but instead, all we\u2019re doing is shifting the tax to our kids\u2026If 5 year-olds knew what we were doing and could vote, none of us would have a job \u2013 because we are spending their money. It\u2019s as if you\u2019re lying on your deathbed, you call your children over to hear your last words, and your last words are \u2018Here\u2019s the credit card, we had a great vacation, your mother and I. You pay the bill.\u2019 That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s unethical \u2013 we are passing the bill onto our children\u2026 \u201c\u2026the idea that these tax cuts are going to pay for themselves? It\u2019s never happened. It\u2019s never happened, it didn\u2019t happen to the Bush tax cuts, it hasn\u2019t happened in Kansas, it just hasn\u2019t happened. So we\u2019re talking about a dramatic increase in the federal deficit on top of what\u2019s already coming\u2026 these are the times when we should be paying back this debt, not making it worse. No rational business would be taking on debt when they\u2019re doing well \u2013 when you\u2019re doing well, you pay down your debt, and then you have a reserve for when you need it. We have no reserve \u2013 we\u2019re using up our cushion. We\u2019re using up whatever cushion we might need for disasters, for some kind of \u2013 heaven forbid \u2013 conflict, or simply for a recession. This is an incredibly destructive bill, and it doesn\u2019t have to be that way\u2026 \u201cThere are many other issues with the bill, but I chose today to focus in my remarks and also on my amendment, on the effects on the deficit because I think it\u2019s one of the most long-term threats. In fact, a former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the national debt is the most serious threat to our national security in the long run. And to aggravate it unnecessarily as this bill would do, I think is irresponsible. Mr. President, we can do better \u2013 I am sure of that \u2013 if we\u2019ll slow down, listen to one another, and do what the American people expect of us.\u201d Senator King, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, has consistently called for a responsible, balanced and long-term approach to addressing our national debt and deficit.   by the Campaign to Fix the Debt, a nonpartisan movement to put America on a better fiscal and economic path.\u00a0"},

For months, moderates in the Senate reached across the aisle to colleagues \u2013 and friends \u2013 asking them to sit down and work together on a commonsense tax reform bill that supports hardworking Americans and fosters economic growth for businesses in Maine and across the country. In other words: to govern. But instead of digging in and doing the hard work, this Senate has decided to pass a bill that helps the few instead of the many, and shifts a massive financial burden onto our children. Rather than maximize this opportunity to help working Americans and set our nation on a path to further prosperity, this bill pushes through at least $1 trillion in unfunded tax cuts for the wealthy and for corporations. These cuts are not only misguided \u2013 they\u2019re downright dangerous, and their effects will be felt by every aspect of our society, from the health of our economy to our national security interests. \u201cBy rushing this legislation through the Senate with no hearings, no input from experts and no feedback from the American people, we\u2019ve advanced a terrible bill that will have terrible consequences. If history is any guide, this will be the major tax reform bill of the next 20 to 30 years, affecting every business, every citizen, and our entire economy. I\u2019m disappointed today \u2013 but I hope members of Congress will reconsider the chance to work across the aisle to make fixes to this deeply flawed piece of legislation, so we can mitigate the damage to everyday Americans.\u201d Senator King\u00a0has consistently called for a responsible, balanced and long-term approach to addressing our national debt and deficit. On Thursday, he offered an amendment to refer the tax bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to create a deficit-neutral proposal.

Senator King served on the conference committee that reconciled the differences between the Senate\u2019s version, which passed by a vote of 89-8, and version advanced by the House of Representatives. The conference report now must be voted on and passed in both chambers of Congress. \u201cThe people of Maine have long played a vital role in our national defense, and this bill will allow them to continue that tradition,\u201d said Senator King. \u201cI am proud that this bipartisan agreement gives Maine\u2019s military personnel and workers in defense-related industries the resources they need to continue making important contributions to protecting our nation. I hope that Congress can build on this positive step by working together to end sequestration, an action that would provide additional resources and boost both our national security interests and our economy.\u201d Senator King secured several major victories that will directly benefit Maine, including: Senator King also cosponsored an amendment authored by Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) in support of the Navy\u2019s Force Structure Assessment requirement for 355 battle force fleet ship.

{"title": "King Backs Bills to Protect Veterans\u2019 Credit Ratings, Educational Opportunities", "date": ["Thursday, November 9, 2017"], "release": " U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) today announced support for two pieces of legislation that would protect veterans credit ratings and educational opportunities respectively. The    , bipartisan legislation introduced by Senator Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), would protect the credit ratings of veterans wrongly penalized by medical bill payment delays by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The   prevents targeting of veterans by low-quality, for-profit universities by closing the loophole that allows for-profit schools to avoid securing at least 10 percent of their revenue from non-federal sources. The current loophole excludes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DOD) education funds, like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Tuition Assistance (TA), from being counted as federal funds. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur nation\u2019s veterans have defended our country with honor and distinction, and deserve every opportunity to get a quality education, buy a house, or take out a loan,\u201d  . \u201cNo veteran should be penalized because of bureaucratic delays at the VA, or be targeted by the predatory practices of some for-profit schools. It\u2019s our duty to protect them when they return home as they have protected us. These commonsense bills will support the men and women who answered the call to serve in the defense of our freedom.\u201d The\u00a0 \u00a0would prohibit medical debt from services received through the Choice Program and other VA community care programs from being reported to credit reporting agencies for one year. This delay provides adequate time for the VA and its contractors to resolve any issues related to inappropriate assignment of debt. The bill would also allow veterans to dispute and remove adverse actions already on their reports. Impacted veterans could submit a notice along with proof that the VA is liable for the debt to a consumer reporting agency (CRA). The CRA would then have to delete all information relating to the veterans\u2019 medical debt from their file and notify the furnishers and the veterans that they have done so. More than two decades ago, Republican President George H.W. Bush signed a bipartisan law that limited how much federal funding for-profit schools may receive from taxpayers. Now called the 90/10 rule, this limit requires for-profit schools to obtain at least 10 percent of their revenues from non-federal sources. Some for-profit schools exploit this 90/10 loophole by using aggressive recruitment practices and deceptive marketing tools to enroll servicemembers, veterans and other GI Bill beneficiaries.   would close the 90/10 loophole by counting VA and DOD funds as federal dollars. Since arriving in Washington, Senator King has been a strong advocate for veterans issues. Through his work on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator King has supported multiple amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that support American veterans. In the Fiscal Year 2018 NDAA, Senator King\u00a0cosponsored an amendment authored by Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) that would encourage cooperation and integration between the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Defense with their electronic health care record systems to improve the transition from active duty to veteran status and ensure that veterans won\u2019t have to wait to gain access to the health care services they have earned. He also supported an amendment authored by Senator Tim Kaine (D-Va.) that would encourage the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Defense to assess the feasibility of establishing a joint office to house an interagency task force on suicide prevention. Senator King supports the coordination between the departments so that those who have served do not slip through the cracks. He is a strong supporter of the  , which helps veterans across Maine and the nation receive health care within their communities and allows veterans in Northern Maine to continue to utilize community care as they did under the Access Received Closer to Home (ARCH) pilot. In August, the President signed into law\u00a0 , legislation he cosponsored that would overhaul the Department of Veteran Affairs\u2019 (VA) appeals process. Senator King\u2019s support for the two bills comes ahead of Veterans Day weekend, where Senator King will honor the dedication and sacrifice of Maine veterans. Tomorrow, he will participate in the Grand Opening and Ribbon Cutting of the Maine Troop Greeters Museum at Bangor International Airport, who have welcomed more than 1.5 million troops flying through Bangor International Airport on the way to or returning from deployment. Following the grand opening, Senator King will travel to Penobscot Indian Island Reservation to present Charles Norman Shay with a flag flown over the United States Capitol. Mr. Shay is a Penobscot Tribal Elder and a veteran of World War II who served as a medic during the D-Day invasion of Normandy on June 6 , 1944.

Open enrollment began on November 1 and currently stands to end on December 15 . The press conference featured health care professionals and advocates, application assisters, and health care providers. In recent months, the Administration has launched numerous efforts to undermine open enrollment including reducing the length of open enrollment from 12 weeks to 6 weeks, announcing a 12-hour shutdown of the ACA website over weekends, and drastically cutting funding for advertising and insurance navigator programs. Despite these changes, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s benefits and assistance with enrollment remain available for those who sign up within the shortened time period. Senator King has been outspoken in his desire to improve the Affordable Care Act to protect coverage for the millions who rely on it for affordable healthcare, and is a cosponsor of the bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to stabilize the individual health insurance marketplace.

{"title": "At Maine Harvest Festival, King Highlights Bipartisan Legislation to Support Agricultural Exports  ", "date": ["Saturday, November 11, 2017"], "release": "Today, U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) attended the Harvest Festival at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor and heard from Maine agriculture stakeholders, farmers and food processers. Senator King also joined members of the Maine Potato Board to highlight the  , a bipartisan bill introduced by Senator King in September that would double funding to two successful U.S. Department of Agriculture export promotion programs and help U.S. farmers maintain an edge in the increasingly competitive global marketplace. \u201cEach and every booth at the Maine Harvest Festival serves as a reminder that our state\u2019s agricultural products stand above the rest,\u201d said Senator King. \u201cBut unfortunately, obstacles such as language barriers and varying regulations make it difficult for smaller farms to expand into foreign markets \u2013 in other words, it\u2019s a tall order to ask a family farm to employ an international trade expert who\u2019s also fluent in Mandarin. As a result, many people in foreign countries are unaware that the words \u201cMaine-grown\u201d are indicative of the highest quality. That\u2019s why MAP and FMDP are so important. These programs have a proven track record of helping American farm products reach foreign markets, opening up new opportunities and adding billions of dollars to our nation\u2019s agricultural industry. Passing the CREAATE Act would allow us to revitalize these programs, in turn creating growth in our vital agricultural industry and more good jobs across the economy.\u201d The  which Senator King introduced in September with Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), aims to revitalize the USDA\u2019s export promotion programs, which generated a net return of $28.30 for every dollar invested between 1977 and 2014. The\u00a0 \u00a0would aid two of the USDA\u2019s most successful programs, the Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP), by doubling their funding over five years. MAP, which is currently funded at $200 million per year, would see its funding rise to $400 million per year, while FMDP would see its funding rise from $34.5 million per year to $69 million per year. Each of these increases would take place incrementally over 5 years. MAP was established in 1985, and allows agricultural trade associations, farmer cooperatives, non-profit trade groups, and small businesses to apply for either generic or brand-specific promotion funds to support exporting efforts. Generic commodity funds are issues with a 10-percent minimum matching fund, while brand-specific funds require a funding match of at least 50%. FMDP was first developed in 1955, and is largely used for the promotion of bulk commodities, helping agricultural trade associations establish permanent presences in important markets. It also includes a matching fund requirement.\u00a0 USDA export programs like MAP and FMDP have added an annual average of $8.15 billion to the value of American agricultural exports, and added up to 239,800 full and part-time jobs, including 90,000 farm sector jobs. Despite these successes, MAP and FMDP funding has not increased since the 2002 Farm Bill, even as competitors increase their efforts; for example, the European Union\u2019s spending for the promotion of wine exceeded the total budget of MAP and FMDP in 2017.

Stopping the flow of these drugs is critical to ending the crisis, but to do so requires the ability to trace the drugs to their source.\u00a0 This demands a forceful and vigorous effort by our forensic science community,\u201d  . , \u201cThe current opioid crisis has overwhelmed the nation\u2019s collective laboratory systems with more than a 6000% increase in the last four years, according to National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) data provided by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors. Case backlogs and turnaround times are growing. Dangerous emerging drugs are not being scheduled to make them illegal, and deaths likely associated with drug overdose are not being investigated completely by medical examiners and coroners.\u201d The bipartisan coalition of senators, led by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and John Cornyn (R-TX), called upon the DOJ to provide Congress with a comprehensive list detailing DOJ efforts to support and prioritize forensic science service providers within 30 days, and to also explain how the Department is including grant programs and technical assistance for providers at the state, county, and local levels to help combat the public health crisis. The forensic science community plays a critical role in communities affected by the opioid epidemic. Labs and other forensic science service personnel help local law enforcement and federal agencies trace drugs to their source by helping to analyze evidence, find importers, manufacturers and distributors, and to determine causes of death in overdoses. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Collins has secured significant funding for addiction treatment services. She recently announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has   \u2013 a $665 million increase over the past two years \u2013 for the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) opioid abuse treatment and prevention programs. The bill directs $500 million to State opioid crisis grants, which were authorized through the 21st Century Cures Act, a bill that was championed by Senator Collins and signed into law in December 2016. Senator King has been a leading proponent of providing additional funding to fight the heroin and opioid crisis, which kills more than one person per day in Maine. He has repeatedly called on\u00a0 \u00a0and both the\u00a0 \u00a0and\u00a0 \u00a0administrations to fund laws and agencies that help address the drug epidemic.

The agreement comes after months of hearings and outreach to stakeholders, companies, and consumers and includes measures from members on both sides of the aisle. Included in the agreement is language modeled after the   bipartisan legislation Senator King introduced with Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) that preserves financial safety measures and broadens small bank lending opportunities to provide families, small businesses, and start-ups better credit options. Specifically, it would require the Federal Reserve to expand the number of institutions to which the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement applies by increasing the asset size threshold from $1 billion to $3 billion. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCommunity banks and credit unions support our state\u2019s businesses, encourage job growth, and help Maine\u2019s hardworking men and women achieve greater financial stability and better credit options,\u201d  . \u201cBut today, these institutions are faced with burdensome regulations that were intended to reign in Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis. Maine people and small businesses should not be paying for these misdeeds. Better tailoring regulations for small financial institutions will help rebalance regulatory costs with their benefits without compromising the safety and soundness of the financial system. \u00a0This commonsense agreement comes after months of measured, thoughtful negotiations and would provide much needed regulatory relief to stimulate our economy and help people across our state. This is an example of how Congress can and should work.\u201d \u201cAccess to affordable credit, including mortgages, is a credit union hallmark and fundamental to economic growth,\u201d  .\u00a0\u201c That\u2019s why the credit unions of Maine thank Senator King for trying to rein in arbitrary restrictions, unnecessary regulations, and cyber threats, all of which increase costs, and reduce access to needed loans.\u00a0 By providing relief in these areas, Senator King will help Maine credit unions continue serve their 700,000 members and small business owners with affordable financial services.\u201d \u201cThe Maine Bankers Association is pleased that Senator King is joining members of the Senate Banking Committee in support of a bi-partisan bill to refine language in previously passed banking legislation,\u201d  .\u00a0\u201cMaine banks have found that restrictive regulatory language has limited lending flexibility to Maine consumers and small businesses. Bankers have found lending to be challenging as national regulatory standards do not always work in a rural state like Maine.\u00a0Passage of this legislation will expand lending opportunities for Mainers while maintaining safety and soundness standards for Maine\u2019s already well-capitalized banking industry.\u201d The package is targeted toward helping community banks, credit unions, mid-sized banks, regional banks and custody banks. It includes important consumer protections, particularly for veterans, senior citizens, and victims of fraud.\u00a0Along with the   several provisions in the agreement are modeled on legislation Senator King has supported: This section, modeled after a provision in the  , provides that certain mortgage loans that are originated and retained in portfolio by an insured depository institution or an insured credit union with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets will be deemed qualified mortgages under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) while maintaining consumer protections. This section, modeled after the  , provides that an individual will be deemed to have temporary authority to act as a loan originator for 120 days under the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 if such person is (1) a registered loan originator who becomes employed by a state-licensed mortgage company or (2) a state-licensed loan originator who becomes employed by a state-licensed mortgage company in a different state. This section, also modeled after a provision in the   provides an exemption from escrow requirements under TILA for certain loans made by an insured depository institution or an insured credit union.\u00a0\u00a0 This section, also modeled after a provision in the  , (1) removes the three-day wait period required for the combined TILA/RESPA mortgage disclosure if a creditor extends to a consumer a second offer of credit with a lower annual percentage rate, and (2) expresses the sense of Congress that the CFPB should endeavor to provide clearer, authoritative guidance with respect to certain issues.\u00a0 This section, also modeled after a provision in the  , provides that banking entities will be exempt from Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act if they have (1) less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, and (2) total trading assets and trading liabilities that are not more than five percent of total consolidated assets. This section, modeled after  , amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to exclude from consumer report information: (1) certain medical debt incurred by a veteran if the hospital care or medical services relating to the debt predates the credit report by less than one year; and (2) a fully paid or settled veteran's medical debt that had been characterized as delinquent, charged off, or in collection.\u00a0 It also establishes a dispute process for consumer reporting agencies with respect to such veterans\u2019 medical debt.\u00a0 This section, modeled after the   extends protections to certain people who, in good faith and with reasonable care, disclose the suspected exploitation of a senior citizen to a regulatory or law-enforcement agency.

A man who was willing to risk his life for that of his wingman, Captain Hudner was bravery personified. Though he will be missed, there are hundreds of men and women working tirelessly at Bath Iron Works to build the ship bearing his name, and ensure his legacy of service and sacrifice is known across the world for generations to come.\u201d Hudner, a veteran of the Korean War, was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman on April 13, 1951 for displaying uncommon valor during an attack on his fellow airman, the first African American naval aviator, Ensign Jesse L. Brown. During the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War, anti-aircraft fire hit Brown's aircraft, causing him to crash. After it became clear that Brown was seriously injured and unable to free himself, Hudner proceeded to purposefully crash his own aircraft to join Brown and provide aid. Hudner injured his own back during his crash landing, but he stayed with Brown until a rescue helicopter arrived. Hudner and the rescue pilot worked in the sub-zero, snow-laden area in an unsuccessful attempt to free Brown, who ultimately succumbed to his injuries, from the smoking wreckage. The future   (DDG-116) was christened in April at Bath Iron Works. Senator King delivered remarks at the event and met Captain Hudner, who attended the christening.

The opioid epidemic now claims 142 lives every day, and it is still getting worse. Drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans under 50, exceeding the peak car crash deaths and H.I.V. deaths decades earlier. Access to naloxone, a life-saving opioid overdose reversal drug, is particularly important given the magnitude of the epidemic. Initially approved by the FDA in 1971, naloxone is used in hospitals and emergency rooms, by first responders, and by members of our communities to revive victims and restart their breathing. Unfortunately, the price of the drug itself has increased dramatically during the epidemic. The prices are highest for newer devices that make delivering the medication easier. Narcan, which administers naloxone as a nasal spray, costs $150 for a two pack and Evzio, a naloxone auto-injector, has increased from $690 in 2014 to $4,500 today for a two pack. Your Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and Opioid Crisis recommends dramatically increasing access to naloxone, and says that \u201cBy declaring a national emergency, you can empower the HHS Secretary to negotiate reduced pricing for all governmental units.\u201d We strongly agree with the recommendation, and urge you to give the Secretary this authority immediately. By doing this, you can put the important medication in the hands of more people and save lives. We hope the policy will be the first step towards substantial action to bring down the cost of all drugs through negotiation and other policies, and part of a comprehensive emergency declaration that includes the investments needed to end the epidemic. ###"},

In the letter, the Senators submit that expanding equitable sharing and adoptive seizures of property violate due process protections for American citizens outlined in the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \u201cCivil asset forfeiture practices defy fundamental principles of due process that are central to our nation,\u201d  . \u201cUnder current practices, federal law enforcement can confiscate property from individuals without first providing those affected with a hearing. Once property is confiscated, the federal government is required to show by a preponderance of the evidence\u2014the lowest civil standard\u2014that the property was merely   to a crime. Property owners who contend that they did not know their property was connected to a crime (for example, a property owner who lends a car to a family member or friend who commits a crime using the car) must prove their lack of knowledge\u2014a remarkable evidentiary burden to impose on someone challenging government action. In all cases, the federal government is not required to charge someone with a crime as a prerequisite to seizing property. We believe these practices are an obvious violation of the due process protections found in the Fifth Amendment.\u201d While in Washington, Senator King has repeatedly expressed concern over civil asset forfeiture policy. In August, Senator King wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions voicing concern over the DOJ\u2019s civil asset forfeiture policy. He is a cosponsor of the Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration (FAIR) Act, legislation that would reaffirm the tenents of the Fifth Amendment and help ensure that property owners\u2019 rights are protected in civil forfeiture proceedings. In May, Senator King joined a bipartisan group of his colleagues to write to the Department of Justice urging the Department to review its civil asset forfeiture practices to better reflect the constitutional rights of United States citizens. Senator King was joined on the letter by U.S. Senators Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Mike Lee (R-Utah), and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). The letter is below and can be read in full  . +++ November 7, 2017 Dear Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Shaheen: In July of this year, the Department of Justice announced that it would expand the practice of civil asset forfeiture by expanding the use of equitable sharing and adoptive seizures of property. As you work with your counterparts in the House to negotiate a final Commerce, Justice, and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year (FY) 2018, we urge you to defund the implementation of these practices. During the consideration of H.R. 3354\u2014the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act\u2014the House of Representatives unanimously accepted three amendments to block DOJ from reinstating a policy of adoptive forfeiture; those amendments are Walberg/Cohen #46, Raskin/Sensenbrenner #67, and Amash/Sanford #70. These amendments were championed by a diverse group of lawmakers and supported by a broad coalition of organizations, including the American Conservative Union, the Institute for Justice, the NAACP, and the ACLU. We also strongly support the inclusion of at least one of these amendments into the final CJS appropriations bill. Civil asset forfeiture practices defy fundamental principles of due process that are central to our nation. Under current practices, federal law enforcement can confiscate property from individuals without first providing those affected with a hearing. Once property is confiscated, the federal government is required to show by a preponderance of the evidence\u2014the lowest civil standard\u2014that the property was merely   to a crime. Property owners who contend that they did not know their property was connected to a crime (for example, a property owner who lends a car to a family member or friend who commits a crime using the car) must prove their lack of knowledge\u2014a remarkable evidentiary burden to impose on someone challenging government action. In all cases, the federal government is not required to charge someone with a crime as a prerequisite to seizing property. We believe these practices are an obvious violation of the due process protections found in the Fifth Amendment.\u00a0 Adoptive forfeiture and equitable sharing are particularly egregious elements of civil asset forfeiture because they not only violate due process but also attack principals of federalism. DOJ\u2019s reinstated policy allows state law enforcement officers to circumvent state limitations on civil forfeiture by turning seized property over to federal officials for forfeiture in exchange for up to 80% of the proceeds of the property. This perversely incentivizes local law enforcement to confiscate suspect property even where state laws forbid the practice. As Justice\u00a0 Thomas recently recognized in response to the denial of certiorari in  , \u201c[t]h[e civil forfeiture system]\u2014where police can seize property with limited judicial oversight and retain it for their own use\u2014has led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses.\u201d  We agree with Justice Thomas, and we ask you to ensure that none of our precious federal resources are used to implement these constitutionally suspect practices. Therefore, as you finalize a spending package for FY2018, we respectfully request the inclusion of language which will prevent the implementation of these polices. ###   , No. 16-122 (Mar. 6, 2017) (Thomas, J.)

It was only after the land was transferred to ANP that the NPS informed the public that the legal authority they used for the transfer came from a 1929 law that many in the Bar Harbor area believed had been repealed in 1986, after successful efforts to pass a law that set boundary limits on the park. The boundary law was crafted due to growing concerns about the size of the park and its impact on the tax base. Further, harvesters of clams and worms in the intertidal zone near Acadia National Park raised concerns that they would not be able to continue their traditional harvesting due to enforcement measures taken by the National Park Service.\u00a0 While the NPS has come to an agreement to allow these traditional harvests to continue, this law would ensure that this traditional harvest can continue uninhibited into the future. The bill originated when the local towns and residents were extremely concerned when they learned that ANP relied on the 1929 law for the Schoodic transfer because it could potentially set precedent for the NPS to use it again. Residents contacted the Maine Congressional delegation to express their concern and request for a repeal of the 1929 law, while at the same time keeping the Schoodic land transfer. In July 2016, Senator King introduced a bill in the Senate to resolve the issue. Later, the bill was amended to address other concerns regarding Acadia National Park, including lifting restrictions on a parcel in Tremont and allowing for traditional harvesting of clams and worms to continue. Earlier this year, during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the President\u2019s nominee for Secretary of the Interior, Representative Ryan Zinke, also assured Senator King that, if confirmed, he would work with the Maine Congressional delegation to resolve these issues. ###"},

In the letter, the Senators voice their support for an affirmative decision in an ongoing antidumping/countervailing duty (AD/CVD) case against Chinese hardwood plywood companies that are benefiting from unfair subsidies from the Chinese Government enabling them to sell \u2013 or \u201cdump\u201d \u2013 their products in the United States at less than market value. \u201cFor many small towns in America, the hardwood plywood industry is the largest source of employment,\u201d\u00a0   \u00a0\u201cWhen facilities are closed by unfair trade, communities are severely harmed.\u00a0 Moreover, Chinese companies in the wood products sector---including hardwood plywood manufacturers\u2014are the world\u2019s largest consumers of illegally sourced wood material.\u00a0 Chinese producers benefit from subsidies and from illegal logging, creating a playing field that tilts in their favor and against hard-working American manufacturers, costing American jobs.\u201d The Coalition for the Fair Trade of Hardwood Plywood represents six American businesses and includes Columbia Forest Products, a hardwood plywood manufacturer which employs more than 160 people at a facility in Presque Isle. The Coalition\u2019s petition is currently under review by both the Department of Commerce and the ITC. Both the DOC and ITC have preliminarily found in favor of the Coalition, and if each body makes a final determination in favor of the Coalition, the DOC will issue an antidumping/countervailing duty order that would instruct U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to\u00a0impose final duties on\u00a0each of the companies that has been found to engage in unfair practices. The Senators  letter was sent in advance of the ITC\u2019s final\u00a0hearing\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0case today. In 2013, the ITC ruled against a similar petition from the American hardwood plywood industry against Chinese companies. Since that time, imports of Chinese hardwood plywood have increased by 40 percent, with imports valued at $1.12 billion in 2016. By comparison, the American hardwood plywood industry is currently operating at less than 50 percent production capacity. In addition to Senators Collins and King, the letter was signed by Senators Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), Shelley Moore Capito (R-West Virginia), Chuck Schumer (D-New York), Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon), Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont), Richard Burr (R-North Carolina), John Boozman (R-Montana), Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia), Bernard Sanders (I-Vermont), Debbie Stabenow (D-Michigan), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin), Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA).

During the prior case, U.S. hardwood plywood manufacturers were operating at no more than 50 percent of their production capacity. Since then, that number has decreased further. This is because, as the Commission found in its preliminary investigation, increasing Chinese imports undersell American-made products by substantial margins. For many small towns in America, the hardwood plywood industry is the largest source of employment. When facilities are closed by unfair trade, communities are severely harmed.\u00a0 Moreover, Chinese companies in the wood products sector\u2014including hardwood plywood manufacturers\u2014are the world\u2019s largest consumers of illegally sourced wood material.\u00a0 Chinese producers benefit from subsidies and from illegal logging, creating a playing field that tilts in their favor and against hard-working American manufacturers, costing American jobs. We appreciate the Commission\u2019s work to date on this important matter, and urge the Commission to ensure U.S. trade remedy laws are fully\u00a0enforced."},
{"title": "Collins, King Push Back on Proposed National Park Fee Increases, Urge Interior to Consider Alternative Strategies to Fix Backlog", "date": ["Friday, October 27, 2017"], "release": "\u2013 U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Angus King (I-Maine) today wrote to the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) urging it to reconsider its proposed strategies to address the maintenance backlog in the National Park System. The letter follows an announcement this week from the DOI that it is\u00a0proposing to increase fees at 17 highly-visited national parks \u2013 including Acadia National Park \u2013 during peak seasons to help offset the backlog. The proposal would nearly triple the cost of park passes for private vehicles at Acadia from $25 a pass to $70 a pass. In their letter, Senators Collins and King highlight alternative solutions to fix the issue, like leveraging excess mineral revenues to create a National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund or establishing a Conservation Service Corps that would engage veterans\u2019 organizations and young people with volunteer-driven conservation projects on federal lands. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c365 days a year, Acadia National Park\u2014one of the crown jewels of the National Park System\u2014serves as a tremendous resource for the people of Maine and the visitors who come here,\u201d  . \u201cFrom May through October, it sustains a vibrant economy in the region, bringing millions of visitors across the country and the world to the coast of Maine. Like most other parks, Acadia has felt the strain of the maintenance backlog, in part due to this sustained visitation. While we recognize that this proposal would bring additional revenue to the park, we are not certain that this would either solve the problem or outweigh the risk to the local community of making the park more difficult to visit. \u201cAccording to the National Park Service, these fee increases are expected to raise $70 million annually. Given the scale of the maintenance backlog, at almost $12 billion, it is difficult to see how this represents a long-term solution to the problem, especially while the National Park Service in its 2018 budget request proposes to cut its own operations budget by $200 million and its maintenance funding by $93 million. We should keep in mind that the American people already pay for the maintenance of the National Park System through their tax dollars; if we are going to ask them directly for a greater contribution to the parks, it should be commensurate with service or more clearly justified than this proposal.\u201d Senators Collins and King, who are members of the Appropriations Committee and Energy and Natural Resources Committee respectively, have supported a number of bipartisan initiatives that would address the maintenance backlog in the National Park System. They are both cosponsors of the , which would take excess mineral revenues to create a National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund starting at $50 million annually and rising to $500 million by 2027. The monies from the fund would be directed to high-priority deferred maintenance needs. Additionally, in the 2016 Energy Policy Modernization Act, Senator King secured a provision that establishes the National Park Service Maintenance and Revitalization Conservation Fund which allocates $150 million annually from offshore leases towards high priority deferred maintenance needs. He is also a cosponsor of the   which would establish a service corps to help address many of the maintenance projects. The maintenance backlog, which accounts for annually deferred maintenance for the National Park System\u2019s 75,000 plus constructed assets, had reached nearly $12 billion at the beginning of 2017. The full letter is below and can be read  . +++\u00a0 October 26, 2017 The Honorable Ryan Zinke Secretary U.S. Department of Interior 1849 C Street, NW Washington, D.C. 20240 Dear Secretary Zinke: We write to express our serious concern for the National Park Service\u2019s proposal to raise the cost of entrance passes at Acadia National Park in Maine and sixteen other highly-visited National Parks. The stated justification for the increases\u2014the chronic maintenance backlog at our National Parks\u2014is a worthy cause, yet this proposal both fails to adequately address that challenge while also raising the possibility of an obvious but unintended consequence: a decrease in attendance at our National Parks. We believe an immediate increase of this magnitude to the fees at Acadia, such as the increase for private vehicles from a $25 pass to a $70 pass, poses a risk to the growing visitation at Acadia. 365 days a year, Acadia National Park\u2014one of the crown jewels of the National Park System\u2014serves as a tremendous resource for the people of Maine and the visitors who come here. From May through October, it sustains a vibrant economy in the region, bringing millions of visitors across the country and the world to the coast of Maine. Like most other parks, Acadia has felt the strain of the maintenance backlog, in part due to this sustained visitation. While we recognize that this proposal would bring additional revenue to the park, we are not certain that this would either solve the problem or outweigh the risk to the local community of making the park more difficult to visit. According to the National Park Service, these fee increases are expected to raise $70 million annually. Given the scale of the maintenance backlog, at almost $12 billion, it is difficult to see how this represents a long-term solution to the problem, especially while the National Park Service in its 2018 budget request proposes to cut its own operations budget by $200 million and its maintenance funding by $93 million. We should keep in mind that the American people already pay for the maintenance of the National Park System through their tax dollars; if we are going to ask them directly for a greater contribution to the parks, it should be commensurate with service or more clearly justified than this proposal. We do believe, however, that in many cases money is being left on the table. To address that, we have advocated for the National Park Service to update its operations, to embrace technology and to be more creative. Only recently has the Park Service updated the cost of the lifetime Senior Pass from $10 to $80, for example. We have also pushed the Park Service to enable online and mobile pass sales to make purchasing passes more visitor friendly. We also believe the Park Service can and should target more revenue from commercial uses and visitation. In order to address the scale of the problem with the maintenance backlog, though, we need to think bigger. There have been a number of bipartisan proposals here in the Senate to address the backlog including S. 751, the National Park Service Legacy Act sponsored by Senators Warner and Portman, which would offer a dedicated revenue source to address the problem from mineral revenues. S.1460, the similarly bipartisan Energy and Natural Resources Act, contains provisions for a similar revenue source. Finally, our colleague Senator McCain has also proposed S.1403, the 21  Century Conservation Service Corps Act, which could help address many of these maintenance projects by expanding the contributions of volunteer service members. As we celebrated the Centennial of the National Park Service last year, we were reminded that these parks are monuments to our nation\u2019s heritage. They are indeed America\u2019s best idea. Without question, if we want to ensure that future generations are able to enjoy them as we have been able to we must properly care for them. We urge you to work with us and with Congress to adequately do so. But before taking the action of raising fees to this degree, we strongly urge you to consider all available options and to consider the full breadth of the impact of this action on Acadia and the other parks. We look forward to working with you on this matter. ###"},

As Congress works to extend a number of vital health care programs, we encourage you to avoid further cutting the PPHF, which often works in tandem with many of these programs. The value of prevention throughout our federal health care system cannot be overstated. In fact, the best way to combat public health outbreaks and emergencies is to prevent them before they arise. As the recent hurricanes, fires, and other natural disasters have reminded us, the federal government plays a key role in identifying and preventing public health threats. Our nation spends upwards of $3 trillion annually on health care, but only an estimated three percent of this amount is dedicated to prevention and public health. Recognizing the need to increase prevention efforts in order to meet the health challenges of the 21st Century, Congress created the PPHF and made the single largest investment in prevention, which Congress allocates through the annual appropriations process. However, discretionary spending restraints established by the Budget Control Act (Public Law 112-25) necessitated the additional use of the PPHF to fill funding gaps for longstanding, core public health activities at and funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Today, the PPHF supplies roughly 12 percent of CDC\u2019s entire budget. While we strongly support reauthorizing and funding the various health care initiatives that have expired or will soon expire, we are concerned about efforts to cut the PPHF to offset the costs of these programs. The CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act under consideration in the House of Representatives this week would institute a $10.5 billion reduction in the PPHF, a 75 percent cut. Using the PPHF as a piggy bank, even for important health programs, will result in major cuts to state, local, tribal, and territorial health departments, as well as other grantees working at the local level. This could mean the elimination of programs currently supported by the PPHF in every state, including: the section 317 immunization program for kids; epidemiology and laboratory capacity grants that support our state and local \u201cdisease detectives;\u201d smoking cessation activities; lead poisoning prevention; and the Preventive Health and Human Services Block Grant. Issuing cuts to the PPHF to fund community health care programs is a clear example of robbing Peter to pay Paul and will have disastrous effects for the health of children and working families. It will also only further exacerbate the long-term problem of mounting health care spending.

To me, this isn\u2019t something academic or political, it\u2019s about saving lives.\u201d In recent months, the Administration has launched numerous efforts to undermine open enrollment including reducing the length of open enrollment from 12 weeks to 6 weeks, announcing a 12-hour shutdown of the ACA website over weekends, and drastically cutting funding for advertising and insurance navigator programs. Despite these changes, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s benefits and assistance with enrollment remain available for those who sign up within the shortened time period. Senator King has been outspoken in his desire to improve the Affordable Care Act to protect coverage for the millions who rely on it for affordable healthcare, and is a cosponsor of the bipartisan bill introduced by Senators Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) to stabilize the individual health insurance marketplace.

At a minimum, we ask that you ensure that there is no reduction in funds allocated to or collected for the High-Cost program until you have reached a comprehensive solution to High-Cost funding.

Senator King announced his support for the bill during a tour of the Stewart Center, a facility that provides day care support services for Mainers living with memory impairments. There, he met with staff, community members, and their families to discuss the challenges of aging at home. The discussion also included local private sector leaders, including representatives from the Southern Maine Agency on Aging, Bath Housing, Spectrum Generations, Maine Women\u2019s Policy Center, and Maine AARP. Prior to the roundtable, Senator King also toured the facility. According to AARP, there are an estimated 40 million family caregivers in the United States, including 178,000 in Maine \u2013 the majority of whom spend an estimated 18 hours per week providing critical support to a family member. The bipartisan   recognizes the essential role that family caregivers play in supporting aging parents or grandparents and family members with a long-term illness or disability. Importantly, these caregivers help aging people needing care stay in their homes, rather than entering a nursing or long-term care facility. More specifically, the tax credit would help alleviate some of the out of pocket financial expenses that caregivers often take on, all while balancing full or part-time employment. The credit would be available to family caregivers to provide some relief for the added costs caregivers incur, such as travel costs for transporting a loved one, home modifications to accommodate a family member\u2019s special needs, medication management services, and more. Additionally, the credit would also phase out at higher income levels and includes important provisions to prevent double-dipping and ensure that appropriate taxpayer protections are in place. : Senator King formally cosponsored the bill last week.

{"title": "King, Colleagues Send Letter to DEA Calling for Stricter Limits of Opioid Pills", "date": ["Tuesday, July 19, 2016"], "release": " \u2013 U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) today released a letter he sent to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) calling on the agency to use its power to more aggressively combat the opioid epidemic ravaging communities from Maine and the nation. Under current law, the DEA is responsible for setting annual quotas for manufacturers\u2019 production of schedule I and II controlled substances, including opioids, which means the DEA effectively serves as a gatekeeper for how many opioids can be produced and sold in the United States every year. In the letter, Senator King, along with several of his colleagues, urged the DEA to help keep unneeded pills from flooding the U.S. market by setting lower quotas in the coming years. For the past two decades, the DEA has approved ever-greater increases in opioid quotas, allowing production of oxycodone to increase 39-fold, hydrocodone to increase 12-fold, hydromorphone to increase 23-fold, and fentanyl to increase 25-fold. \u201cWe agree and believe efforts to halt this widespread epidemic will not be successful unless we use every tool at our disposal. We urge DEA to utilize its existing quota setting authority, to the fullest extent possible, to combat this epidemic,\u201d  . \u201cFourteen billion opioid pills are now dispensed annually in the United States \u2013 enough for every adult American to have a bottle of pills. Certainly, the pharmaceutical industry is at fault for decades of misleading information about their products and the medical community bears responsibility for its role in over-prescribing these dangerous and addictive drugs, but we remain deeply troubled by the sheer volume of opioids available \u2013 volumes that are approved by DEA.\u201d The letter sent today outlines changes the DEA should immediately adopt to improve the quota setting process, including making the quotas that each drug company receives public, justifying the public health benefits of any opioid quota increase, and taking the opioid epidemic into consideration when setting quotas. The full text of the letter, which was led by Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and cosigned by Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), can be read below: +++ July 19, 2016 The Honorable Chuck Rosenberg Acting Administrator United States Drug Enforcement Administration 8701 Morrissette Drive Springfield, VA 22152 \u00a0 Dear Acting Administrator Rosenberg: Our nation is in the midst of a prescription opioid and heroin crisis that is destroying the lives of our friends, our neighbors, and our family members. In 2014, 28,647 people nationwide died from an opioid overdose. As you stated in announcing the 2016 National Heroin Threat Assessment Summary, \u201cWe tend to overuse words such as \u2018unprecedented\u2019 and \u2018horrific,\u2019 but the death and destruction connected to heroin and opioids is indeed unprecedented and horrific.\u201d We agree and believe efforts to halt this widespread epidemic will not be successful unless we use every tool at our disposal. We urge the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to utilize its existing quota setting authority, to the fullest extent possible, to combat this epidemic. We have appreciated hearing about DEA\u2019s efforts to combat the ongoing opioid crisis, including DEA\u2019s \u201c360 Strategy.\u201d While this strategy lists demand reduction as a core focus, it appears primarily focused on the downstream dynamics of the problem, such as targeting the violent cartels and drug trafficking gangs responsible for perpetuating the opioid epidemic. These efforts, much like DEA take-back days, are critically important and should be commended. However, they do not go far enough. We believe DEA can and should be doing more. Each year, DEA is responsible for setting annual quotas for manufacturers\u2019 production of schedule I and II controlled substances, including opioids. In effect, DEA serves as a gatekeeper for how many opioids are allowed to be legally sold every year in the United States. Yet, for the past two decades, DEA has approved significant increases in the aggregate volume of opioids allowed to be produced for sale in the United States. Between 1993 and 2015, DEA allowed aggregate production quotas for oxycodone to increase 39-fold, hydrocodone to increase 12-fold, hydromorphone to increase 23-fold, and fentanyl to increase 25-fold. According to IMS Health, 14 billion opioid pills are now dispensed annually in the United States \u2013 enough for every adult American to have a bottle of pills. Certainly, the pharmaceutical industry is at fault for decades of misleading information about their products and the medical community bears responsibility for its role in over-prescribing these dangerous and addictive drugs, but we remain deeply troubled by the sheer volume of opioids available \u2013 volumes that are approved by DEA. The Controlled Substances Act provides DEA with a number of authorities, which, if utilized fully, could help appropriately reduce the number of opioids available nationwide. First, when DEA, in a given year, approves a higher opioid quota than is ultimately used, DEA can and should lower the ensuing year\u2019s quota accordingly if there is no other compelling need for the higher quota. Second, DEA has the authority to approve mid-year quota adjustments and thus could take a more judicious approach for initial opioid quota setting and allow for mid-year adjustments, if needed. Finally, when setting quotas, DEA\u2019s authority states that \u201cthe Administrator shall consider changes in the currently accepted medical use in treatment with the class or the substances which are manufactured from it.\u201d We believe the recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain constitutes a \u201cchange in the currently accepted medical use\u201d of opioids and should be taken into consideration when setting future years\u2019 opioid quotas. The 2016 CDC Guidelines recommend dramatic changes in how opioids are prescribed for chronic care patients. For instance, the medical experts at the CDC recommend that patients receive immediate-release opioids instead of extended-release or long-lasting opioids; that patients receive the lowest effective dosage of opioids possible; and that patients receive opioids for the shortest possible effective duration. Taken together, these CDC recommendations clearly demonstrate that fewer opioids will be medically necessary in the coming years. These new guidelines \u2013 coupled with recent opioid drug manufacturer settlements acknowledging both the addiction risks of these products and the insufficient research body about the effectiveness of opioids when used long term \u2013 provide grounds within the scope of DEA\u2019s existing authority to take proactive steps to lower quotas. In addition to the steps outlined above, we also strongly urge DEA to do the following: Thank you for your commitment to finding a solution to the prescription opioid and heroin crisis. We look forward to working with you to address this epidemic and request that you outline any authorities DEA needs, but does not currently have, to address the quota-setting concerns and proposed changes outlined above. We appreciate your consideration and look forward to your response. Sincerely, ###"},

{"title": "At Opioid Roundtable in Bangor, King Underscores Importance of Medication-Assisted Treatment in Fight Against Addiction ", "date": ["Tuesday, July 26, 2016"], "release": "\u2013 U.S. Senator Angus King (I-Maine) today convened a roundtable with nurse practitioners in Bangor that focused on the importance of working to expand medication-assisted treatment, also known as MAT, which can be a critical tool in helping people overcome opioid or heroin addiction. The discussion builds on reforms enacted by the   (CARA), which provides a community-based response to the addiction crisis facing America. The legislation specifically includes a provision supported by Senator King that increases access to MAT by allowing trained nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe it. MAT is a treatment option for addiction that includes the use of medication, such as Suboxone, along with counseling and other support. Numerous studies have demonstrated MAT\u2019s effectiveness; however it continues to remain vastly underutilized across Maine and the country at a time when treatment is desperately needed. According to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 people in Maine wanted drug treatment but were unable to attain it. CARA, which was signed into law by the President on July 22, ushers in new reforms to fight addiction by expanding access to MAT. More specifically, the bill includes a provision that allows nurse practitioners and physician assistants who are trained and who meet other criteria to obtain a federal license to prescribe buprenorphine therapy, which is also called Suboxone. Additionally, following a request from Senator King and other lawmakers, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is currently working on raising a prescriber cap that limits the ability of some physicians to prescribe MAT to some patients. Under current regulations, physicians that are certified to prescribe buprenorphine for MAT are allowed to prescribe up to 30 patients initially and then after one year can request authorization to prescribe up to a maximum of 100 patients. HHS is currently working to raise that cap to 275. \u00a0 Today\u2019s discussion was the fifth roundtable that Senator King has convened across the state as part of his effort to tackle the opioid and heroin epidemic, which he has made one of his top priorities in the Senate. He has previously held discussions in  ,  ,  , and   \u2013 each of which focused on a different aspect of the opioid and heroin crisis, and each of which have helped inform his work in Washington. Senator King has introduced and supported several pieces of legislation to help tackle addiction, and continues his push for emergency funding to fight the epidemic. ###"},

Along with an earlier purchase made this year at the Delegation\u2019s request, that would bring the total to 11.7 million pounds, amounting to an estimated $12.75 million for Maine blueberry growers. \u201cWith the harvest getting underway in the weeks ahead, this news comes at a critical time for Maine blueberry growers,\u201d  .\u00a0 \u201cNot only will they get financial help in recovering from low prices in 2014 and 2015, but they will also be able to make room for the incoming harvest. This is welcome support for our industry in Maine, which provides for more than 3,000 jobs in its peak season.\u201d In January, the Delegation asked the USDA to purchase surplus blueberries through its Bonus Buy program to help growers who have faced declining prices because of record crop sizes in 2014 and 2015.\u00a0 USDA answered in April by announcing that it would purchase up to $13 million of product. USDA made an initial purchase in June of about 7.9 million pounds of berries at a cost of $8.6 million.\u00a0 Based on that price, the additional 3.8 million pound purchase is worth an estimated $4.14 million. The Bonus Buy program supports the emergency surplus removal of commodities, which are then distributed to domestic food assistance programs. ###"}
