{"title": "From the Senate Floor,   Senator Collins Urges Colleagues to Support Amendments She Introduced to Support Tax Relief for the Middle Class", "date": ["Posted Thu, 11/30/2017 - 16:02"], "release": "U.S. Senator Susan Collins spoke from the Senate floor this afternoon to urge her colleagues to support four amendments she introduced to the Senate tax reform bill that would strengthen the legislation in important ways for middle-income Americans.\u00a0 \u201cBy reforming our nation\u2019s tax code, we can reduce the tax burden on hardworking Americans and help spur job creation and economic growth,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cMy amendments would improve upon the Senate\u2019s current tax reform proposal by allowing filers to deduct state and local property taxes, protecting retirement benefits for employees of nonprofit organizations and local governments, making the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit refundable, and reducing the threshold for deducting medical expenses.\u00a0 These amendments would provide essential tax relief for many middle-class families in Maine and across the country.\u201d Senator Collins\u2019 first amendment would allow taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes.\u00a0 In recent years more than 95 percent of all itemizers, and 28 percent of all federal income tax filers, deducted state and local taxes, including property taxes.\u00a0 Yet, the Senate bill would eliminate this deduction altogether.\u00a0 This deduction is especially important to Maine, where 166,000 itemizers deducted a total of $725 million in property taxes on their federal income tax returns each year.\u00a0 Senator Collins\u2019 amendment would allow the vast majority of Mainers who itemize to fully deduct their property taxes. The second amendment Senator Collins introduced would strike a provision that could reduce the retirement benefits of church, charity, school, and government employees, including firefighters, teachers, and police officers.\u00a0 As drafted, the Senate bill would eliminate critical tax rules that allow employees of nonprofits and local governments to make additional \u201ccatch-up\u201d and \u201cmake up\u201d contributions to their retirement accounts during and near the end of their careers.\u00a0 This amendment would protect these special rules to ensure those employees who serve the public achieve greater retirement security. Senator Collins\u2019 third amendment would improve the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit by making it refundable, thus providing much-needed assistance to low-income working families.\u00a0 This would help many families afford high-quality child care or adult day care for older parents or other relatives who can no longer care for themselves. Finally, Senator Collins introduced an amendment that would lower the threshold for Americans to deduct medical expenses.\u00a0 Currently, due to a provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), consumers can deduct medical expenses only if they exceed 10 percent of their income.\u00a0\u00a0 Senator Collins\u2019 amendment would restore the threshold to 7.5 percent, the level prior to the ACA, to help all taxpayers, and particularly seniors, who are struggling with high medical costs."},
{"title": "Senator Collins\u2019 Statement in Support of Senate Tax Reform Bill", "date": ["Posted Fri, 12/01/2017 - 14:56"], "release": "U.S. Senator Susan Collins announced today that, after securing significant changes, she will support  , the first major overhaul of our nation\u2019s tax code since 1986. She released the following statement: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a single American who thinks that our current tax code is fair, simple, or promotes economic growth.\u00a0 We need a tax system that will boost the economy, help the middle class, and encourage small businesses to grow and create jobs.\u00a0 If we stimulate the economy through tax reform, we can significantly increase federal revenues while boosting Americans\u2019 take-home pay.\u00a0 \u201cBy nearly doubling the standard deduction and expanding the child tax credit, this bill will provide significant relief to lower- and middle-income taxpayers. For example, a single mother with one child earning $35,000 will see her taxes drop by nearly 4,000 percent. Instead of paying money to Washington, she will be getting more than $1,100 back each year to help her make ends meet.\u00a0 \u201cOver the past several weeks, I have worked to ensure that the Senate bill includes a number of important changes. \u201cFirst, I advocated strongly for restoring the state and local property tax deduction up to $10,000, a critical provision that will provide much-needed tax relief for hard-working, middle-income families.\u00a0 Passage of my amendment will allow the vast majority of Mainers who itemize to fully deduct their property tax bill. In Maine, 166,000 taxpayers who itemize deduct a total of $725 million in property taxes on their federal income tax returns.\u00a0 This is often the largest deduction taken by Mainers. In fact, Mainers have the 11  highest per capita property tax burden in the nation.\u00a0 \u201cSecond, my amendment to help Americans struggling with high unreimbursed health care costs was incorporated into the bill.\u00a0 I am pleased that the final bill will include my amendment to lower the threshold for claiming the deduction for these unreimbursed expenses from 10 percent to 7.5 percent of income for two years.\u00a0 The House bill eliminated this long-standing deduction used by 8.8 million Americans \u2013 nearly half of whom make less than $50,000 per year.\u00a0 A harmful provision of the Affordable Care Act had increased the threshold to 10 percent of income. Lowering the threshold will provide relief for those experiencing particularly high health care costs, including seniors and those with pre-existing conditions.  \u201cThird, I\u2019m pleased that my amendment to reverse the Senate bill\u2019s ill-advised elimination of catch-up contributions to retirement accounts for church, charity, school, and public employees was adopted. My amendment will help protect these employees \u2013 including firefighters, school teachers, and police officers \u2013 by striking provisions in the Senate bill that would have reduced their ability to save for retirement.\u00a0 These first responders and other public servants should not have their standard of living in retirement diminished because they chose to work in public service. \u201cIn addition, I was deeply concerned that the repeal of the individual mandate would almost certainly lead to further increases in the cost of health insurance premiums \u2013 premiums that are already too expensive under the ACA.\u00a0  \u00a0 The first, the Bipartisan Health Care Stabilization Act introduced by Senators Alexander and Murray, will provide vital funding in 2019 and 2020 for the cost-sharing reductions received by low-income enrollees in the ACA exchanges.\u00a0 This funding helps low-income families pay their out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles and co-pays. The second is bipartisan legislation I introduced that would protect people with pre-existing conditions while lowering premiums through the use of high-risk pools.\u00a0 This plan will provide $5 billion annually for two years in seed money for states to establish invisible high-risk pools or traditional reinsurance programs. We know from experiences in the states of Maine and Alaska that high-risk pools can help to lower premiums substantially \u2013 by an average of 20 percent.\u00a0 \u201cI have also heard a great deal of concern from seniors with the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s determination that an automatic four percent cut to Medicare, estimated to be roughly $25 billion for fiscal year 2018, could be triggered by the passage of this legislation as a result of the Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) even though there is no intention for such a reduction to occur.\u00a0 Medicare provides essential benefits to our nation\u2019s seniors, and any reduction in funding triggered in this way would be completely unacceptable.\u00a0   urging that we immediately remove the threat of an automatic cut in the program\u2019s funding, which has been done on numerous occasions before, and  . \u201cHaving secured these key improvements in the bill, as well as the commitments to legislation to help lower health insurance premiums, I will cast my vote in support of the Senate tax reform bill. As revised, this bill will provide much-needed tax relief and simplification for lower- and middle-income families, while spurring the creation of good jobs and greater economic growth.\u201d"},

Freedom is more than the name of that lovely Waldo County community; it is its heritage.\u00a0 The first settler in 1794 was Stephen Smith, a patriot who fought for freedom in the Revolutionary War.\u00a0 The town was incorporated during the War of 1812, the first challenge to our young nation\u2019s freedom.\u00a0 In 1863, with the Civil War raging, a young man from Freedom named Daniel Davis left school and joined the 1  Maine Cavalry Regiment so that the blessing of freedom would be extended to all Americans.\u00a0 In 1880, he became Maine\u2019s 37  Governor. On Veterans Day 2017, the people of Freedom paid tribute to their family members, friends, and neighbors who served in our time.\u00a0 The celebration coincided with the 98  birthday of Roy Ward, the town\u2019s oldest citizen, whose courageous Navy service during World War II inspires us today. While Freedom\u2019s history is unique, the virtues it describes unite our great nation.\u00a0 It is estimated that some 48 million Americans have served in uniform since the founding of our nation.\u00a0 Today, more than 20 million veterans live among us, more than 116,000 right here in Maine. \u00a0To put that in perspective, Maine has more veterans per capita than all but two of the other states in the country.\u00a0 We are proud of our State\u2019s contributions to protecting our nation. Those numbers are impressive not only because of their sheer size, but also because they describe the history of a people united by the highest ideals of humanity.\u00a0 Those numbers are not cold statistics.\u00a0 Each one tells a story of courage, sacrifice, and devotion to duty. On Veterans Day, we honor those who paid the ultimate price, whether they lie at rest in foreign lands or in their hometowns.\u00a0 We honor those who lived beyond their years of military service but who have since passed on.\u00a0 We honor those who remain missing and pledge that they never will be forgotten.\u00a0 And we honor those veterans who are with us today.\u00a0 We owe them all a great debt.\u00a0 We also honor the parents, the wives and husbands, the children and other loved ones of our veterans and our troops.\u00a0 The families left behind face the challenges of daily living as they endure separation and worry.\u00a0 Their sacrifices are great, and we owe them much as well. It is the American character to answer the call of duty.\u00a0 It also is the American character to be grateful to those who answer that call.\u00a0 One has only to look at the Maine Troop Greeters, who have greeted some 1.5 million troops at the Bangor Airport, to know how much the people of our State value our service members.\u00a0 They treat our veterans with similar generosity and a spirit of caring. We owe our veterans so much, and repay that debt in part, but only in part, with the gratitude we express on Veterans Day.\u00a0 As a nation, we must also repay our debt with the health care, rehabilitation services, and educational and employment opportunities our veterans have earned through their service to our country.\u00a0 I am committed to ensuring that the government keeps that sacred obligation.\u00a0 Initiatives I have undertaken in the Senate this year to help ensure that veterans receive the quality, accessible health care and other benefits they earned through their service include the bipartisan   that would expand a successful program that helps those who care for wounded, ill, or injured veterans at home.\u00a0 Being in the Town of Freedom on Veterans Day brought to mind one of my earliest childhood memories -- going with my father, a World War II veteran, to the patriotic parades in my hometown of Caribou.\u00a0 He hoisted me high on his shoulders, and from the best vantage point along the route, I saw hats go off and hands go over hearts as Caribou paid its respects to our flag and honored our veterans for their service to our country. Our veterans provide all of us with an inspiring view from strong shoulders.\u00a0 From that vantage point, we see that the burden of service must be borne willingly and with modesty.\u00a0 We see that challenges must be met and that threats must be confronted.\u00a0 And we see that we have an obligation to always respect, honor, and support those who make that view possible."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cState of the Union\u201d November 19, 2017 TAPPER: And joining us now is Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine. Senator, I want to get to taxes in a moment, but I do want to start with the Alabama Senate race where Republican nominee Roy Moore has been accused of sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl, sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl. You've urged Moore to withdrawal from the race, but you also said that if he wins, the Senate would have, quote, no choice but to seat him. I do wonder, though, if Moore is elected, I understand he would have to be seated, but would you want the Senate to vote to expel him? COLLINS: It's too early for me to say what the Ethics Committee recommendation would be. And obviously I came out against Roy Moore very early, in fact before these terrible allegations were levied against him, because I was concerned about his performance as a member of the Alabama Supreme Court, where he had been removed twice for failing to follow lawful orders and also because of his comments on Muslims and LGBT individuals. So, these allegations are extremely disturbing. But under the Constitution, the test on whether or not you seat someone is whether they satisfy the age and residency requirements. So, we would have to seat him, but I hope we don't get there. I think we're getting ahead of ourselves. And I hope that the voters of Alabama choose not to elect him. TAPPER: Would you rather serve with Doug Jones, the Democrat, than with Roy Moore? COLLINS: I don't know Doug Jones at all, but I've never supported Roy Moore. And I hope that he does not end up being in the United States Senate. TAPPER: And just to be clear, and then we'll move on from Roy Moore, you believe the women? You think that these are credible allegations that he assaulted -- sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl and sexually molested a 14-year-old girl? COLLINS: I do. I read his explanation. I listened to his radio interview. And I did not find his denials to be convincing at all. So, from my perspective, these are credible allegations against him. TAPPER: Now, the White House has not commented on whether the allegations are credible, but President Trump did attack Senator Al Franken after the allegations against him. They were asked, the White House, this week, why are the allegations between -- against Franken different from the allegations -- multiple allegations from at least 13 different women against President Trump. Listen to how the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, answered. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH SANDERS: Specifically, Senator Franken has admitted wrongdoing and the president hasn't. I think that's a very clear distinction. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: It's kind of an odd thing to say in some ways. Do you buy the notion that Trump's accusers are not credible because the president denies the allegations? COLLINS: I did not support President Trump. He was not my candidate for president. And part of the reason why were allegations about how he treated women. I made my decision before the Hollywood Access tape came out. But I was not a supporter of President Trump for the Republican nomination. TAPPER: Let's turn to taxes. You said this week that Republicans made a big mistake when they changed the tax bill to include this repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate because that -- removing that could raise taxes or payment -- health care payments, premiums, for millions of Americans. If that provision stays in the tax bill, will that mean a \"no\" vote from you? COLLINS: Well, first of all, I think we need to distinguish between taking away insurance from people who already have it, which is what the health care bills that we considered earlier this year would have done, versus removing a fine on people who choose not to have insurance. And that fine falls disproportionately\u201480 percent\u2014on those who make under $50,000. I don't think that provision should be in the bill. I hope the Senate will follow the lead of the House and strike it. If not, I think we need to fix it by passing two bills, the Alexander-Murray bill, which will help to stabilize markets and reduce premiums, and a bill I've introduced with Bill Nelson of Florida that would create high-risk pools that would protect people with pre-existing conditions and also help to reduce premiums by 20 percent. TAPPER: You say that you have data show that the premium increase will outweigh any tax cut that a middle-income person might get from this tax bill. If that data point doesn't change -- I just want to drill in on this point -- will you have to vote \"no\" if there isn't the relief that you're looking for, either by tinkering with this bill or through the legislation you just offered? COLLINS: The bill's going to be subject to amendment on the Senate floor, and I'm filing amendments myself, in part to provide more relief to middle-income families and to deal with the very problem that you have identified. The fact is that if you do pull this piece of the Affordable Care Act out, for some middle-income families, the increased premium is going to cancel out the tax cut that they would get. And that's why it's so important that we pass the two pieces of legislation that I talked about. And it's also why we need to restore the tax deduction for state and local taxes, the way that the House did. That will help our middle-income taxpayers get more tax relief. I also want to keep the tax rate at right where it is, at 39.6 percent for people who are making $1 million or more a year, rather than lowering it, as the Senate bill would do. TAPPER: Senator Orrin Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, got angry at Democrats this week for suggesting that this tax bill is a give-a-way to the rich. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ORRIN HATCH: I really resent anybody saying that I'm just doing this for the rich. Give me a break. SEN. SHERROD BROWN: How many times do we do this before we (INAUDIBLE) -- SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Listen, I've honored you by allowing you to spout off here. And what you said was not right. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: Let's drill down on the -- on the actual issue that they're debating here. Based on the numbers you've seen, does this tax bill benefit the rich more than it does the middle class? COLLINS: It benefits people of all tax brackets. But what I want to do is to skew more of that relief to middle and low-income families.\u00a0 The Senate bill starts to do that. It doubles the child care -- the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and it also makes part of it refundable to very low-income individuals who don't pay any tax at all. It doubles the standard deduction so that a couple making $24,000 would pay no income tax at all. So, I don't think those allegations are fair. But nevertheless, there are provisions of the bill that I would like to see changed. And keeping that top rate for individuals where it is, for people making more than $1 million is one change. And I would also like to see the business taxes, which do need to be reduced, in order to incentivize the creation of good jobs and higher wages in this country, but it does not need to be reduced all the way to 20 percent for large businesses. TAPPER: All right, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, always a pleasure to have you on. Thank you so much. COLLINS: Thank you, Jake."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cThis Week\u201d November 19, 2017 GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, HOST: Want to continue it now with Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine. Senator Collins, thank you for joining us this morning. You just heard our panel right there. Weigh in, please. Do you think this is a moment where we're going to see real change? SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: I do. But I thought that there was one aspect that hasn't been discussed. And that is that the women who bring forth these allegations are often trashed. They're attacked. Their credibility is undermined. We saw that with some of President Clinton's accusers. We know the elaborate attempts that Harvey Weinstein went to in order to discredit his accusers. And that has to stop, as well. STEPHANOPOULOS: And we see -- we saw just recently both -- we're seeing it right now. You mentioned President Clinton. And it certainly did happen then. We also see Roy Moore now calling all of his accusers liars. President Trump, more than a dozen women came forward during the campaign\u00a0 He says that every single one of them are lying. COLLINS: He did say that. And, President Trump was not my choice for the Republican nominee for president. And, I did not support him in part because of the way that all of these reports about how he was treating women. He is president now. And, I am working with him on some issues. But those allegations remain very disturbing. STEPHANOPOULOS: Can you work with Roy Moore? If he gets elected, should he be investigated? Will you vote to expel? COLLINS: Well, first of all, my hope is that we won't get to that point, and that the voters of Alabama will not elect Roy Moore. I've read his denials. I've listened to his radio interview. And I did not find him to be credible. As more and more allegations come forward, that adds to the weight of evidence against him. I believe, based on my reading of the Constitution, that if he is elected that we have no choice but to seat him. Then, however, the Ethics Committee could have an investigation. And since I essentially would be a juror, if that happens, I'm not going to comment on what could happen as a result of that investigation. But, I hope that the good voters of Alabama decide not to send him to the United States Senate. STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Al Franken is also going to be subject to an Ethics investigation. You can't comment on that either? COLLINS: Well, first, let me say that I believe the allegations and Al Franken has essentially admitted to them. I'm talking about what the outcome would be if the Ethics Committee proceeds with an investigation, which I believe the Ethics Committee is going to do so. But I did find the allegations against him to be both credible, disgusting, and appalling, and degrading to women. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's move on to the tax bill. Passed the Senate Finance Committee this week. And a separate tax bill passed the House as well. You're already facing ads back in your home state by a group called \"Not One Penny.\" Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED: It's hard enough for Mainers to find our way in this economy. But the Trump Republican tax plan would leave us lost in the wilderness just to pay for huge tax cuts for the wealthiest. Thankfully, Senator Susan Collins told us that she would say no to tax breaks for the wealthiest. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: Can you vote for the bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee? COLLINS: I want to see changes in that bill. And I think there will be changes. There are some provisions of the House bill that I like better. For example, the House retains the top rate of 39.6 percent for people who make $1 million or more a year. That's a change that I would like to see be made in the Senate bill so that we can skew more of the relief to middle-income taxpayers. So, some very good provisions in the Senate bill such as the doubling of the child tax credit and making it refundable for people of low income. There\u2019s also a doubling of the standard deduction, which means that a family making $24,000 would not pay any income tax. So, there are provisions of both bills that I like. But I think the bill needs work. STEPHANOPOULOS: You can't vote for it as written? COLLINS: I haven't reached that conclusion yet, because I think there are going to be further changes. But the biggest mistake was putting in a provision from the Affordable Care Act into the Senate bill that is not in the House bill. And I hope that will be dropped or, that bills have been introduced by Senators Alexander and Murray and Bill Nelson and myself will be adopted to mitigate the impact of those provisions. STEPHANOPOULOS: That provision was put in at the insistence of the president. He was tweeting about it last week. He seems to think that it's the best way to both save some money and to get some of the partial repeal of Obamacare. So, if it stays in the bill, are you against the bill? COLLINS: It's a problem for me if it is not mitigated. But there is a way to mitigate the impact that it would have on insurance premiums. I do want to point out that that provision, all that provision says is that a person who chooses not to get insurance cannot be fined for that decision. That's very different from what we were faced with this past summer and fall when insurance was being taken away from people who wanted to be insured. The fact is that those fines are paid by -- overwhelmingly by people who make less than $50,000 a year, 80 percent of the people who pay the fines fall in that category. But I'm worried about the impact on premiums. And that's why we're going to need to pass legislation. And I would like to see that done before we go to the tax bill. STEPHANOPOULOS: And unlikely the Democrats are going to support doing that before the tax bill. One other feature of the Senate tax bill is that the corporate tax cuts are permanent, yet the individual tax cuts are temporary. COLLINS: Again, that's not a provision that I like. The House made both of them permanent. I think that is a far better way to go. I also think the reduction in the business tax rate is too steep, and that we could go to 22 percent, and then use that money, which is about $200 billion, to restore the tax deduction for state and local property taxes. That would really help middle-income taxpayers. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sounds like you still have a lot of questions about this bill. One other feature pointed out by the Congressional Budget Office this week is that if this bill passes, with the increase in the deficit that it accommodates, over $1.5 trillion, there will be at least $25 billion in Medicare cuts next year. COLLINS: I have talked to my colleagues about that, because that's obviously something that I cannot support. I do believe that's going to be dealt with as part of the budget negotiations that are ongoing right now. There are ways to reform our entitlement programs, but that is not one of them. The whole idea of across-the-board cuts or sequestration, or offsets that affect some of our most vulnerable citizens or our seniors is not something that I can support. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, Senator Collins, listening to you today, it looks like that bill is going to have to change an awful lot before it can get your support. Thank you for joining us this morning. COLLINS: Thank you, George."},

This bipartisan legislation would create a public health infrastructure to combat Alzheimer\u2019s disease and preserve brain health. Representatives Brett Guthrie (R-KY) and Paul Tonko (D-NY) introduced a companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease is one of the greatest and under-recognized public health threats of our time.\u00a0 Five and a half million Americans are living with the disease, and that number is soaring as our overall population grows older and lives longer,\u201d  . \u201cAfter decades of expanding biomedical research in Alzheimer\u2019s, we are ready for the next step: to translate research into practice.\u00a0 I urge my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this critical bipartisan legislation.\u201d \u201cAs one of the leading causes of death in the United States, Alzheimer\u2019s prevention is crucial to combatting this debilitating disease,\u201d  . \u201cThe number of Americans afflicted with this illness is growing at a staggering pace, and without intervention, nearly 16,000,000 Americans could be affected by 2050. The BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer\u2019s Act will address the scourge of Alzheimer\u2019s by creating centers of excellence and assisting state and local governments in their efforts to promote awareness through education and dissemination of best practices. We must work to promote Alzheimer\u2019s prevention, enhance access to treatment, improve patients\u2019 quality of life and find ways to end Alzheimer\u2019s before it claims more lives.\u201d \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s is such a devastating disease that affects millions of Americas and their loved ones, and the more we can do to find a cure, the better. At the same time, we must also do what we can to ease the pain of those suffering and provide help to caregivers, taking a truly comprehensive approach to this fight,\u201d  . \u201cBy creating a public health infrastructure, this bipartisan legislation will help us tackle Alzheimer\u2019s on all fronts and move us closer to finding a cure.\u201d \u201cAs the number of people diagnosed and living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease continues to grow, we have to help alleviate the burden this disease has on our health care system and families across Virginia,\u201d  . \u201cThe BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act addresses a problem I often hear from Virginians: how do we improve care for loved ones who are battling Alzheimer\u2019s? States often lack resources that would help caregivers address patient needs. This bipartisan bill would improve care and outcomes by providing a full range of information and support to families caring for loved ones with Alzheimer\u2019s, and boosting local efforts dedicated to addressing this pressing public health need.\u201d \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s is the costliest disease in America, with over 5 million Americans living with this disease. Almost every Kentuckian I know is affected by this disease in some way, and many have become caregivers for their family members suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d  . \u201cThat\u2019s why I was proud to join a bipartisan, bicameral group of members to introduce the Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer\u2019s Act. This bill supports cooperative agreements between public and private entities focused on ways to develop best practices for intervention and caregiving, which will help lower costs and promote evidence based research for those who suffer from this awful disease and for those who care for these individuals.\u201d \u201cFrom my very first days in Congress, I have worked to improve the lives of those suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and help modern medicine move closer to finding a cure. Through the Alzheimer\u2019s Accountability Act and the HOPE for Alzheimer\u2019s Act, we laid the groundwork for unprecedented federal investments in Alzheimer\u2019s research and improved care planning for those facing an Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis,\u201d  . \u201cNow we have a critical opportunity to take another giant step forward on this issue, making investments in Alzheimer\u2019s infrastructure that will drive public health research and promote prevention, early detection and diagnosis, all leading to lower costs and better care. I\u2019m proud to stand alongside my fellow Alzheimer\u2019s champions in introducing the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer\u2019s Act and I look forward to getting this important legislation signed into law.\u201d \u201cToo often, Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias are viewed as normal issues of aging, rather than as fatal disease, with devastating effects for caregivers as well,\u201d said   \u201cThe BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act invests in a nationwide Alzheimer\u2019s public health response, which will improve quality of life for those living with the disease and their caregivers, while reducing costs for both American families and for our country. We deeply appreciate the continued bipartisan leadership of the act\u2019s sponsors in addressing the Alzheimer\u2019s crisis.\u201d This legislation would apply a public health approach to Alzheimer\u2019s disease by establishing a modern infrastructure for the prevention, treatment, and care of Alzheimer\u2019s and related dementias. Headed by the Centers of Disease and Prevention (CDC), it would establish: The BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer\u2019s Act is supported by the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, Alzheimer\u2019s Impact Movement, National Association of Chronic Disease Directors, and the National Association of Counties.\u00a0 Click   and   to read their letters of support.

This month is dedicated to those who have been stricken with Alzheimer\u2019s, their family members and other devoted caregivers, and to the medical professionals and researchers who are working to advance our understanding of the disease, find an effective treatment, and, ultimately, discover a cure and a means of prevention. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is one of the greatest under-recognized public health threats of our time.\u00a0 Five and a half million Americans are living with the disease, including 27,000 here in Maine, and that number is soaring as our overall population grows older and lives longer.\u00a0 In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer\u2019s is our nation\u2019s costliest disease.\u00a0 The United States spends more than $259 billion per year, including $175 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid.\u00a0 By 2050, if we continue along this trajectory, costs are projected to increase to more than $1.1 trillion, and the number of Americans living with Alzheimer\u2019s is expected to reach 16 million.\u00a0 While Alzheimer\u2019s is the only one of our nation\u2019s most deadly diseases without an effective treatment or cure, new research is showing that there are actions we can take to promote prevention and improve treatment.\u00a0 The first step we should take is to recognize Alzheimer\u2019s as a public health crisis.\u00a0 I have introduced bipartisan legislation, the Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer\u2019s Act, to create a public health infrastructure to combat Alzheimer\u2019s disease and preserve brain health through early detection and diagnosis as well as improved treatment and care. It is because of public health advancements that we have safe water to drink, vaccines to prevent deadly diseases, and emergency preparedness tools to save lives.\u00a0 Using a public health approach, there is potential to change the trajectory of Alzheimer\u2019s. The effort to overcome Alzheimer\u2019s disease through a unified national effort is gaining traction.\u00a0 In 1999, when I founded the Bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer\u2019s, there was virtually no focus in Washington on this disease.\u00a0 In fact, people were afraid to say the word \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s,\u201d just as \u2013 years ago \u2013 people didn\u2019t talk about cancer.\u00a0 Seven years ago, I co-authored the bipartisan National Alzheimer\u2019s Project Act, which set the primary goal of preventing and effectively treating the disease by 2025.\u00a0 That legislation created an expert council, which has calculated that $2 billion per year is needed to achieve that goal. On the Appropriations Committee, I worked to turn the words of that recommendation into action.\u00a0 The proposed funding bill for the upcoming fiscal year provides a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health that includes a $414 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s research, the largest in history.\u00a0 That brings the total for Alzheimer\u2019s research to $1.8 billion \u2013 well within reach of our $2 billion goal.\u00a0 While research is moving forward, we must also put in practice what we know about prevention, and enhance the quality of care and support for those living with Alzheimer\u2019s and their families.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on families and communities.\u00a0 The BOLD Act, which I have introduced, would establish Centers of Excellence in Public Health Practice to promote better treatment and care for those living with Alzheimer\u2019s.\u00a0 The Centers would also educate the public on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cognitive decline, and brain health.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My legislation would also help communities across America to combat Alzheimer\u2019s. \u00a0The legislation would direct the CDC to establish and distribute awards of funding to local public health departments to support Americans living with Alzheimer\u2019s and their caregivers.\u00a0 The awards of funding would also be used to educate Americans about ways to reduce the risk of memory loss, and other symptoms that can happen before Alzheimer\u2019s strikes.\u00a0 Finally, at the heart of public health is data.\u00a0 This legislation would direct CDC to collect data to help us better understand the trends in cognitive decline, cognitive impairment, and caregiving.\u00a0 The data would be shared with the public and used to improve brain health. For far too long we have viewed Alzheimer\u2019s as an aging issue that plagues some seniors today and threatens to affect many more tomorrow.\u00a0 New research finds that, in fact, Alzheimer\u2019s is a public health issue with a course that we can change.\u00a0 The BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer\u2019s Act would create a new enlightened public policy out of promising research.\u00a0 It would dramatically change the way we think of the disease, and ultimately, it has the potential to save millions of lives.\u00a0"},

For this reason, we write to encourage the FCC to take the much-needed step of addressing the High-Cost Universal Service Fund budget shortfall,\u201d\u00a0the senators wrote in the letter. The senators continued,\u00a0\u201cMany of the providers that serve rural consumers and businesses in our states have already begun to feel the pain of an arbitrary budget cap on High-Cost USF support.

Senator Casey and I encourage our colleagues to join our efforts to change the trajectory of our nation by supporting the Nourishing Our Golden Years Act.\u201d \u201cFederal nutrition assistance, like the Senior Food Box Program, is a vital lifeline for many seniors,\u201d   \u201cThe Nourishing Our Golden Years Act would make it easier for older adults to benefit from the Senior Food Box Program and reduces the likelihood that a recipient would miss a re-certification deadline and become ineligible. This bill would help us fulfill our sacred responsibility to older Americans by ensuring they have access to nutritious foods.\u201d The Senior Food Box Program improves the health of low-income Americans, ages 60 and up, by providing non-perishable items, and fresh fruits and vegetables, to program participants once a month. By extending how often participants must recertify, from a minimum of six months to a once a year, the Nourishing Our Golden Years Act would minimize the burden for both participants and states. Currently, in some states, seniors who receive a food box must re-certify by proving their eligibility to participate every six months. Participants who miss the deadline to re-certify are no longer eligible to receive a food box and must re-apply, putting them on the state\u2019s waitlist. Since most low-income seniors are on a fixed income, they are unlikely to experience fluctuations in eligibility. A growing number of older Americans face hunger and food insecurity. In 2014, 10.2 million older adults, ages 60 and up, experienced some level of food insecurity. According to the Good Shepherd Food Bank of Maine, nearly one in three Maine seniors face hunger or the threat of hunger.\u00a0 Seniors who are food insecure are more likely to experience depression, develop asthma and report heart problems\u2014all of which can lead to increased doctor and emergency room visits, hospitalizations and disability. In the U.S., the estimated annual cost of disease-associated malnutrition among older Americans is more than $50 billion. In July, the Senate Aging Committee, chaired by Senator Collins, held a hearing on senior nutrition. During the hearing, Pat Taylor, a retired health care worker of Penn Hills, PA, testified about the support her family receives from the monthly Senior Food Box Program. \u201cThe senior food box has been a god-send\u2026Because of the senior food box that we receive through the Lincoln Park Community Center, we do not have to decide between paying for our medication and putting nutritious food on the table,\u201d Mrs. Taylor said.

Following the tragic shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on November 5, 2017, the Air Force announced that the gunman\u2019s domestic violence offense was not entered into the NCIC database. We understand that the Air Force has initiated an investigation into this case, and that the Department of Defense has also launched a review of how the gunman\u2019s criminal records were handled. We urge you to conduct a review of the NCIC database reporting procedures across all Armed Services components for the past decade. We further request a full review of military records and databases to ensure criminal records in other cases have been reported correctly.\u00a0 According to law enforcement reporting, the gunman, a former Airman, was convicted by a general court martial on two charges of domestic assault against his wife and stepson under Article 128 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. These convictions make it illegal for an individual to buy or possess a firearm under federal law, yet the failure to enter the gunman\u2019s criminal conviction into the NCIC system prevented the shooter from being flagged in the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). This allowed him to purchase at least four firearms over the last four years, including the firearm used in this horrific shooting. The 2007 NICS Improvement Act directs federal agencies to report records identifying prohibited persons to the Attorney General no less than quarterly. This incident raises the question of whether there are other gaps in the military\u2019s criminal records reporting procedures. In addition, inmate in-processing could provide an additional opportunity for the Armed Services to check that cases are properly reported. We welcome your views on this and other potential improvements. Please provide us with a report and regular updates on the details of this investigation and the actions the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security are taking to ensure that military records across the Armed Services are accurately and consistently reported to the NCIC, in accordance with federal law.

Stopping the flow of these drugs is critical to ending the crisis, but to do so requires the ability to trace the drugs to their source.\u00a0 This demands a forceful and vigorous effort by our forensic science community,\u201d  . , \u201cThe current opioid crisis has overwhelmed the nation\u2019s collective laboratory systems with more than a 6000% increase in the last four years, according to National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS) data provided by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors. Case backlogs and turnaround times are growing. Dangerous emerging drugs are not being scheduled to make them illegal, and deaths likely associated with drug overdose are not being investigated completely by medical examiners and coroners.\u201d The bipartisan coalition of senators, led by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and John Cornyn (R-TX), called upon the DOJ to provide Congress with a comprehensive list detailing DOJ efforts to support and prioritize forensic science service providers within 30 days, and to also explain how the Department is including grant programs and technical assistance for providers at the state, county, and local levels to help combat the public health crisis. The forensic science community plays a critical role in communities affected by the opioid epidemic. Labs and other forensic science service personnel help local law enforcement and federal agencies trace drugs to their source by helping to analyze evidence, find importers, manufacturers and distributors, and to determine causes of death in overdoses. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Collins has secured significant funding for addiction treatment services. She recently announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has   \u2013 a $665 million increase over the past two years \u2013 for the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) opioid abuse treatment and prevention programs. The bill directs $500 million to State opioid crisis grants, which were authorized through the 21st Century Cures Act, a bill that was championed by Senator Collins and signed into law in December 2016. Senator King has been a leading proponent of providing additional funding to fight the heroin and opioid crisis, which kills more than one person per day in Maine.

The post ends with its own incendiary conclusion. It says, \u2018When even the governor is not safe from leftist haters, then what can we say about ordinary citizens? Liberals are now acting like terrorists. They are trying to intimidate everyone who disagrees with them. Hope our police will take appropriate measures against these cowards.\u2019\u201d Senator Collins pointed out that Governor LePage is not up for reelection and is term limited, so the purpose of these posts in particular was to further polarize American society rather than influence an election.\u00a0 \u201cThe posts are just three among 80,000 that reveal the Russian playbook of playing both sides off against each other and of sowing discord and division with inflammatory rhetoric,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cThe Russians continue to push this kind of divisive rhetoric to this very day.

We value the trust that users place in our services. And when they show up to connect with friends and family and to discuss issues, they need to know that the discourse they see is authentic,\u201d  \u201cWhat is so painful about this type of content is that it exploits truly and passionately held views and then inflames them to create more discord and more distrust.

This was a welcome gift from the local towns and communities. It was only after the land was transferred to ANP that the NPS informed the public that the legal authority they used for the transfer came from a 1929 law that many in the Bar Harbor area believed had been repealed in 1986, after successful efforts to pass a law that set boundary limits on the park. The boundary law was crafted due to growing concerns about the size of the park and its impact on the tax base. Further, harvesters of clams and worms in the intertidal zone near Acadia National Park raised concerns that they would not be able to continue their traditional harvesting due to enforcement measures taken by the National Park Service.\u00a0 While the NPS has come to an agreement to allow these traditional harvests to continue, this law would ensure that this traditional harvest can continue uninhibited into the future. The bill originated when the local towns and residents were extremely concerned when they learned that ANP relied on the 1929 law for the Schoodic transfer because it could potentially set precedent for the NPS to use it again. Residents contacted the Maine Congressional delegation to express their concern and request for a repeal of the 1929 law, while at the same time keeping the Schoodic land transfer. In July 2016, Senator King introduced a bill in the Senate to resolve the issue. Later, the bill was amended to address other concerns regarding Acadia National Park, including lifting restrictions on a parcel in Tremont and allowing for traditional harvesting of clams and worms to continue. Earlier this year, during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the President\u2019s nominee for Secretary of the Interior, Representative Ryan Zinke, also assured Senator King that, if confirmed, he would work with the Maine Congressional delegation to resolve these issues."},

As Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Aging Committee, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bob Casey (D-PA), have made fighting fraud against older Americans a top priority. This Veterans Day, they are warning the public of various scams that specifically target veterans.\u00a0 Some of these schemes include benefit scams, imposter scams, or charity scams that use the word \u201cveteran\u201d to try and trick unsuspecting donors into giving money to fraudsters. \u201cVeterans Day is a day to honor and thank those who served in our nation\u2019s armed forces\u201d  \u201cDespite our deep gratitude for their service and sacrifice, the unfortunate reality is there are criminals and scammers who will always exploit others to make a quick buck. We must keep working to ensure the public is aware of these scams, which can either target our nation\u2019s heroes or prey on those who want to support them.\u201d \u201cOn Veterans Day, and every day, it is important that we honor the extraordinary sacrifice of those who put their life on the line to serve, defend and protect our country and fellow citizens,\u201d   \u201cIt is our duty to ensure that our veterans, their families and caregivers do not become victims to scam artists who seek to defraud them of their hard-earned benefits. I will continue working to stop unscrupulous people who try to profit in the name of patriotism.\u201d Charity scams that target people\u2019s sense of giving and patriotism are particularly prevalent around Veterans Day.\u00a0 Criminals posing as charitable organizations and claiming to benefit veterans and their families will often use the word \u201cveteran\u201d to try and trick unsuspecting Americans. Donors who want to give money to a legitimate veteran\u2019s organization this Veterans Day should make sure to look into the charity and make a direct payment rather than making a payment through a wire transfer or gift cards. Benefit scams, or pension advances, will try to charge veterans who are seeking to claim benefits they rightfully earned through the Veterans Administration (VA).\u00a0 Advisers, who are approved by the VA to help veterans file a pension or other claims, are never allowed to charge for their services.\u00a0 In addition, imposter scams involve someone claiming to be from the VA seeking personal information.\u00a0 If you are contacted by someone, either by phone or email, claiming to represent the VA and requesting payment for services or wanting to confirm your personal information, disregard the solicitation and contact the VA directly for assistance. Other scams can involve phony sales or rentals on the Internet offering veterans or military discounts.\u00a0 Always be suspicious of anyone requesting upfront payments via wire transfer or gift cards. Americans who suspect fraud can contact experienced investigators at the Senate Aging Committee\u2019s toll-free Fraud Hotline.\u00a0 If you have questions or believe you are the victim of a scam, call  .\u00a0"},

The dedication of the new Breakwater in America\u2019s easternmost city made the 2017 celebration truly unforgettable. Since it was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1962, the Eastport Breakwater has been a vital facility. The success achieved there in cargo shipping strengthened Maine\u2019s connection to the world and laid the foundation for the Estes Head Cargo Terminal. This necessary barrier protects Eastport\u2019s inner harbor and promotes economic development and job growth in the region through its support of commercial fishermen, recreational boaters, and others who rely on the structure. As the base for both the United States Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection, the Breakwater plays a key role in maritime safety and national security. The original Breakwater, called \u201cThe Million Dollar Pier,\u201d performed valuable service long past its expected 20-year lifespan, but time, tides, and weather took a toll on the steel structure. In early 2013, the Eastport Port Authority met with stakeholders to develop a plan to secure federal and state funding to rebuild the deteriorating facility. Later that year, I was successful in securing a $6 million federal grant for the Port of Eastport to help restore the Breakwater. The National Infrastructure Investment Grant Program, also known as TIGER, was established in 2009 to provide federal assistance for vital transportation projects. Since its inception, I have worked each year to ensure that the program has been funded and have strongly advocated for the projects submitted by the Maine Department of Transportation. During the program\u2019s eight years of operation, I have been able to successfully secure more than $122 million for key transportation investments throughout Maine, including bridges, seaports, and rail projects. Along with the $6 million TIGER grant, the Maine Department of Transportation and the Port of Eastport contributed significant funding to renovate the Breakwater. Unfortunately, just one week after the project was put out to bid in November of 2014, the Breakwater suffered a catastrophic collapse, shutting it down and delaying construction. The Eastport Port Authority, the City Council, and the Maine Department of Transportation worked together to rebuild this necessary structure. The new $15 million Breakwater, using composite materials more resistant to corrosion than steel, will serve the city, our State, and our nation for decades to come, and I was delighted to take part in the dedication ceremony. One of my highest priorities as Chairman of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee has been to improve our nation\u2019s infrastructure and to ensure that Maine\u2019s needs are met. In my travels throughout Maine, I\u2019ve seen first-hand the positive effects of investing in our ports, railroads, and crumbling roads and bridges to improve safety, boost our economy, and create much-needed jobs, and I will continue to advocate for responsible investments to improve our nation\u2019s aging infrastructure. It is a privilege to join the Maine Department of Transportation and Maine communities in this important work. Whether in a small town or a major hub of commerce, these projects have the immediate benefit of keeping our skilled construction workers on the job. When complete, they help enhance safety, grow the economy, and create opportunity. Improving transportation in Maine requires a strong partnership at the federal, state, and local levels, the very kind of partnership that resulted in the new Eastport Breakwater."},

A transcript of the interview follows: DICKERSON: Senator, I want to start with your former colleague, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. The Washington Post has a story suggesting those answers he gave to you and the rest of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate may not have been complete. This is based on wiretaps, apparently has been overheard by the former Russian ambassador. What do you make of that story? COLLINS: Well, first of all, let me say that the Intelligence Committee will follow any credible allegation as part of our investigation. I would point out that there is a big difference between an unsubstantiated leak about an alleged intercept versus sworn testimony and facts. And our focus is on sworn testimony and getting all the facts. I would note also that the Russian ambassador is our adversary and the Russians have shown themselves to be masters at misinformation. Nevertheless, this clearly is an area that we need to pursue further. The one final point that I would make is, if in fact this is a leak of an intercept, and I don't know whether or not the report is accurate, that is extremely serious. That has the potential to compromise our national security and to undermine the safety of those who are in the intelligence community. DICKERSON: The president said this week that it was unfair for Attorney General Sessions to recuse himself and not tell the president before he hired him. Do you agree with that? COLLINS: I don't agree with that at all. The attorney general followed the rules and guidelines of the Department of Justice. He met with career staff, and he made the right decision in recusing himself. DICKERSON: In my conversation with the new communications director at the White House, Anthony Scaramucci, he suggested this new strategy we've seen this week, which is to raise questions about the special counsel, Mr. Scaramucci said of the president who has been critical of the special counsel, quote, \u201clet him do it.\u201d What\u2019s your assessment of what the White House\u2019s message is about the special counsel? COLLINS: I understand how difficult and frustrating this investigation is for the president, but he should not say anything further about the special counsel, his staff, or the investigation. I know it's hard, but he needs to step back and not comment and let Bob Mueller, who is an individual with the utmost integrity, carry out the investigation and make his determination. DICKERSON: I understand the memos from former FBI Director James Comey are with the committee. Have you looked at them? COLLINS: We have not yet been given access to those memos. I\u2019m very eager to see them. As you know, the FBI director memorialized his discussion with the president, particularly about his suggestion that the president directed him or implied that he should drop the investigation into Michael Flynn. So it's important that we see these memos. Having said that, I do think that it was a violation of the FBI\u2019s old guidelines\u2014which Mr. Comey helped to write\u2014for himself to have leaked some of those memos to a friend of his in hopes of prompting the appointment of a special counsel. DICKERSON: Let me switch to health care. What\u2019s going to happen next week, and what will you be doing and what will your position be? COLLINS: Well, it's a good question about what's going to be happening next week. It appears that we will have a vote on Tuesday, but we don\u2019t know whether we're going to be voting on the House bill, the first version of the Senate bill, the second version of the Senate bill, a new version of the Senate bill, or a 2015 bill that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act now and then said that somehow we\u2019ll figure out a replacement over the next two years. I don't think that's a good approach to facing legislation that affects millions of people and one-sixth of our economy. What I would like to see us do is to go back into committee. Lamar Alexander, the Chairman of the Senate Health Committee, has already indicated his willingness to hold hearings. We could divide this issue into separate bills and take a look at the serious flaws in the Affordable Care Act, the most serious of which right now is the collapse of the insurance market in several counties throughout this country so that people who have subsidies won\u2019t have an insurer that can sell them insurance. That would allow us to hear from expert witnesses to get input from actuaries, and governors, and advocacy groups, and health care providers and most important from members of both sides of the aisle, Republicans as well as Democrats. DICKERSON: We just have 10 seconds left. Have you heard from the president trying to lobby you on this? COLLINS: I\u2019ve heard from the vice president, from the head of CMS, and from the president's chief of staff. I talked to the president very briefly at the lunch but have not had further conversations with him. DICKERSON: Alright, we'll have to end it there. Thank you, Senator Collins,"},

Brady Chappell of Naples also attended the hearing as one of the 160 Children\u2019s Congress delegates, who are selected from nearly 1,300 entries in a national competition on the basis of a letter that they wrote stating why a cure for T1D is important to them. This is the 9th time Senator Collins has chaired the Children\u2019s Congress. \u201cI want to give a special welcome to the two delegates from Maine, Charlie Albair of Gray and Brady Chappell of Naples. I am proud that you are here representing our great State of Maine,\u201d   \u201cI appreciate that you have shared your personal stories and told us what it\u2019s like to live with diabetes, just how serious it is, and why it is so important that Congress fund the research necessary to discover better treatments and, ultimately, a cure.\u201d \u201cSince I started the Senate Diabetes Caucus, funding for diabetes research has more than tripled from $319 million in 1997 to more than a billion dollars this year,\u201d   \u201cAs a result, we have seen encouraging developments in the management, treatment, and potential cures for Type 1 diabetes. With continuation of this investment, we can see a future in which the children here today can look forward to a better and brighter tomorrow.\u201d Charlie described how some of these advancements have made managing his diabetes easier. \u201cIn the beginning, we treated my diabetes with syringes. And a half a year later, I got the Omnipod pump and then a [continuous glucose monitor] to monitor my sugar levels,\u201d   \u201cWhen I first found out I had diabetes, I remember thinking that this would change my whole life.

{"title": "Sen. Collins' Statement on Health Care Vote", "date": ["Posted Fri, 07/28/2017 - 10:05"], "release": "Senator Susan M. Collins Statement on Health Care Reform July 27, 2017 Few issues are as important or personal to the American people as health care, which is why this debate has been so fervent and ignites such passion. On the one hand, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has allowed millions of individuals and families to obtain health insurance for the first time.\u00a0 It has also brought important patient protections like those for people with pre-existing conditions and prohibitions on annual and lifetime limits on insurance payments for needed care.\u00a0 On the other hand, too many Americans face skyrocketing premiums and unaffordable deductibles coupled with mandates that give them few, if any, choices.\u00a0 Some insurance plans have become so restrictive that families find they can no longer go to the doctor or hospital of their choice. In addition, the ACA\u2019s employer mandate discourages businesses from creating jobs or giving their workers more hours, while its tax credits and subsidies are designed so poorly as to cause \u201cwage lock\u201d \u2013 where working harder to get ahead can instead make some Americans fall further behind. \u00a0Despite President Obama\u2019s campaign promise that his health care plan \u201cwould save the average family $2,500 on their premiums\u201d per year, the opposite has happened as premiums are increasing in nearly every state, with an average increase of 25 percent nationally last year.\u00a0 And today, despite the implementation of the ACA, 28 million Americans remain uninsured. These problems require a bipartisan solution.\u00a0 The Democrats made a big mistake when they passed the ACA without a single Republican vote.\u00a0\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to see Republicans make the same mistake.\u00a0 Earlier this week I voted against proceeding to health care reform legislation \u2013 the American Health Care Act of 2017 \u2013 that passed the House of Representatives last May without a single Democratic vote.\u00a0 For many Americans, this bill could actually make the situation worse.\u00a0 Among other things, the bill would make sweeping changes to the Medicaid program \u2013 an important safety net that for more than 50 years has helped poor and disabled individuals, including children and low-income seniors, receive health care.\u00a0 The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the number of uninsured Americans would climb by 23 million under this bill. Senate Leaders, recognizing that the House bill did not have sufficient support, advanced their own substitute proposal that would make similar structural changes to the Medicaid program, as well as many other changes.\u00a0 CBO estimates that this plan would reduce the number of people with insurance by 22 million, cause premiums and other out-of-pocket costs to soar for Americans nearing retirement, and shift billions of dollars of costs to state governments.\u00a0 It also would undermine the financial stability of rural hospitals and long-term care facilities and likely lead to the loss of important consumer protections for many Americans, while doing virtually nothing to address the underlying problem of escalating health care costs.\u00a0 Earlier this week, this body struck down that proposal by a vote of 43 to 57. A separate proposal that would simply repeal the ACA without a replacement also failed, by a vote of 45 to 55.\u00a0 \u00a0That legislation, according to CBO, would result in 32 million people losing their insurance, bringing the total number of uninsured Americans to 60 million a decade from now.\u00a0 Clearly, that is going in the wrong direction. In a final effort to reach consensus, Republican Leaders have pieced together a plan that would repeal key portions of the ACA while punting on many of the more difficult questions.\u00a0 While I support many of the components of this plan, this approach will not provide the market stability and premium relief that is needed.\u00a0 In fact, a bipartisan group of Governors wrote Senate Leaders this week urging rejection of this so-called \u201cskinny\u201d plan, which they say \u201cis expected to accelerate health plans leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having access to coverage.\u201d I ask consent that the letter be entered into the record. Also included in all of these plans is a misguided proposal that would block federal funds, including Medicaid reimbursements, from going to Planned Parenthood. \u00a0Millions of women across the country rely on Planned Parenthood for family planning, cancer screening, and basic preventive health care services.\u00a0 Denying women access to Planned Parenthood not only runs contrary to our goal of letting patients choose the health care provider who best fits their needs, but it also could impede timely access to care.\u00a0 If Planned Parenthood were defunded, other family planning clinics in Maine, including community health centers, would see a 63 percent increase in their patient load.\u00a0 Some patients would need to drive greater distances to receive care, while others would have to wait longer for an appointment. Let me be clear that this is not about abortion.\u00a0 Federal law already prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion except in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is about interfering with the ability of a woman to choose the health care provider who is right for her.\u00a0 This harmful provision should have no place in legislation that purports to be about restoring patient choices and freedom. We need to reconsider our approach.\u00a0 The ACA is flawed and in portions of the country is near collapse.\u00a0 Rather than engaging in partisan exercises, Republicans and Democrats should work together to address these very serious problems.\u00a0 In their letter to Senate Leaders, the bipartisan group of Governors correctly notes that, \u201cTrue, lasting reforms can only be achieved in an open, bipartisan fashion.\u201d Health care is extraordinarily complex, and we must work together systematically in order to \u201cdo no harm\u201d and improve our health care system.\u00a0 In developing legislation, our focus should be on the impact on people, premiums, and providers. We\u2019re dealing with an issue that affects millions of Americans and one sixth of our economy, and we need to approach reforms in a very careful way. That means going through the regular process of committee hearings; receiving input from expert witnesses such as actuaries, governors, advocacy groups, and health care providers; and vetting proposals with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\u00a0 It needs to be a much more deliberative process, and I am pleased that Chairman Alexander has expressed a willingness to begin hearings in the Senate Health Committee.\u00a0 Neither party has a monopoly on good ideas, and we must work together to put together a bipartisan bill that fixes the flaws in the ACA and works for all Americans.\u00a0"},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cState of the Union\u201d July 30, 2017 TAPPER: A dramatic moment on Capitol Hill, Senator John McCain, in the wee hours of the morning, voting no on the Republicans' latest plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. His vote, along with that of two other Republicans, Murkowski and Collins, was enough to quash the bill. And President Trump, frankly, looked back in anger. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: They should have approved health care last night, but you can't have everything. Boy, oh, boy. They have been working on that one for seven years. Can you believe that? The swamp. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: Joining me now, one of the three Republican senators who voted no on that legislation, Senator Susan Collins of Maine. Senator, thanks so much for joining us. COLLINS: My pleasure, Jake. TAPPER: So, Senator, before I get to policy, I just have to ask, I saw this viral video of you getting off an airplane in Bangor, Maine, and a crowd of people spontaneously and organically applauding you. I don't know if that happens to you every time you get off an airplane in Bangor, Maine. (LAUGHTER) TAPPER: But it was a pretty remarkable thing. What is the response you're getting? COLLINS: It really was so extraordinary, heartwarming and affirming. I got off the plane, and there was a large group of outbound passengers, none of whom I happened to know, and, spontaneously, some of them started applauding, and then virtually all of them started to applaud. It was just amazing. I have never had that happen in the 20 years that I have been privileged to serve in the Senate. So, it was very encouraging and affirming, especially arriving back home after a very difficult time. TAPPER: A very difficult time, very contentious time. President Trump, as you know, is hoping to revive the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. He needs the vote of one more senator in order to flip someone's vote, whether yours or Murkowski's or McCain's. The president appears to be threatening to cut off funding for the health care plans that the members of Congress receive. Would that kind of pressure change your vote? COLLINS: No. But, you know, the ball is really in our court right now. There are serious problems with the ACA. We're seeing collapsing markets in some areas of the country where, even though people have subsidies, they're not going to be able to buy an insurance policy. So, our job is not done. And what we need to do is to remember my friend Lamar Alexander's words, which is that he says that Congress doesn't do comprehensive well. We need to go back to committee, to the Health Committee, and the Finance Committee, identify the problems, carefully evaluate possible solutions through hearings, and then produce a series of bills to correct these problems, the most serious of which is the pending collapse of the insurance markets. And I certainly hope the administration does not do anything in the meantime to hasten that collapse. TAPPER: Well, as you note, the president is also threatening to cut off what he calls bailouts for insurance companies. Presumably, he's referring to the payments the government makes to insurance companies to reduce the costs for low-income Americans. The Trump administration has threatened to withhold this money before, which has led to uncertainty among insurance providers. If President Trump were to officially withdrawal that funding, would that affect your vote on health care? COLLINS: It would not affect my vote on health care, but it's an example of why we need to act to make sure that those payments, which are not an insurance company bailout, but rather help people who are very low-income afford their out-of-pocket costs towards their deductibles and their co-pays. And that's what we need to remember. So, it really would be detrimental to some of the most vulnerable citizens if those payments were cut off. They're paid to the insurance companies, but the people that they benefit are people who make between 100 percent and 250 percent of the poverty rate. So, we're talking about low-income Americans who would be devastated if those payments were cut off, though the threat to cut off those payments has contributed to the instability in the insurance market. But what Congress needs to do is to start by the first bill that we should consider is how to stabilize the market. And that is a key component, to ensure that those payments continue to be made to benefit low-income Americans. TAPPER: You are one of three Republican senators who voted against the so-called skinny repeal of Obamacare. When did you realize that Senator John McCain was going to join you and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in voting no? And what Vice President Pence say to you when he walked up to you on the Senate floor and tapped you on the back? COLLINS: Well, Senator McCain had given an extremely eloquent speech on the Senate floor the day before, when he had arrived back from Arizona after his devastating diagnosis with brain cancer. And he called for a return to the regular order, where we would work together across the aisle to produce legislation. It has been my experience as well that that is what works best and that is what produces sound legislation. So, he had given this dramatic and heartfelt speech. But it was only date of the vote, just a few hours before the vote, that I realized from my conversations with him that he was going to vote no. Vice President Pence had come over originally to break the tie that most people anticipated was going to happen when Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and I voted no. Instead, the vice president ended up coming over to lobby John McCain directly, to try to get him to vote yes. And I was talking with John. And I felt this tap on my shoulder, and I turned around, and it's the vice president. And he said to me, \"Boy, are you tough.\" But he softened that by putting his arm around me. And he has always been extremely courteous in his conversations with me. He then started talking with John. We were reminiscing in some ways. And then it was obvious he wanted to have a private conversation with John about the bill. So, I stepped aside and did not participate in that part of the bill. But I was very proud of John. Once again, he showed the courage that he has demonstrated throughout his life to do the right thing, even when it's not popular, even when it's hard. TAPPER: The health care bill is just one of many moments of drama in the last week. There's been a tremendous amount of infighting at the White House, the president attacking his own attorney general, the communications director attacking the now former chief of staff and the president's senior strategist. Is this affecting the president's ability to get his agenda passed on Capitol Hill? COLLINS: It doesn't really affect the president's agenda. As I said, I really think that the health care bill -- and I think it will be a series of bills -- is in our court now. But I don't think it's helpful to the presidency in general. And I -- the president certainly has the right to choose whomever he wants to be on his personal staff. But I certainly hope that his new communications director strikes a different tone than he has in his first week on the job. TAPPER: I want to ask you a question about governing in the Trump era. When the president tweets, do you consider those tweets to be policy, or should they be ignored, in the way the Pentagon seems to be, in a way, treating his tweet about banning transgender people from serving in the military? They're kind of -- they seem to be saying, oh, well, he tweeted that, but we don't have any policy, so we're just going to keep on as we're going. How do you take the president's tweets? COLLINS: I personally don't think that governing or setting policy by tweet is a wise approach. It creates confusion. It does not give details. These are serious issues that we're dealing with. I do understand why it's attractive to the president to be able to get his message out. But when it comes to an issue that has widespread implications, whether it's health care or the transgender issue for our military, I just don't think a tweet is the right way to go. I think he should have a serious policy discussion with his Cabinet, with those who are responsible for implementing policy, because then there's much more clarity in how to proceed. So, that would be my advice to the president. But I know he's very fond of Twitter. TAPPER: All right, Senator -- he sure is. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, thank you so much for your time today. We appreciate it. COLLINS: Thank you."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cMeet the Press\u201d July 30, 2017 TODD: Joining me now from her home state of Maine is one of the Republican senators who consistently voted against her party's health care bills, the various repeal and replace options. It\u2019s Susan Collins. She joins me now from Bangor. Senator Collins, welcome back to the show. COLLINS: Thank you, Chuck. TODD: Let me ask you this, one of the same questions I asked Secretary Price. Do you accept the premise that the efforts to repeal Obamacare are fully dead and it is now time to refer to this as our national health care system and it is his job and your job to make it work? COLLINS: I don't accept the premise that we should not proceed to reform the law. There are some very real problems in the law. Secretary Price is right about that, and he identified them. The problem is that Congress, as my friend and colleague Lamar Alexander has often said, does not do comprehensive well. What we need to do is to go through the normal process, identify the problems, have hearings, hear from experts, hear from all the stakeholders, and produce a series of bills to fix the very real flaws in the Affordable Care Act. First on my list would be to stabilize the insurance markets to make sure that people have access to insurance. TODD: Are you confident, though, that Secretary Price at HHS is implementing -- is trying to keep this law afloat -- that is doing everything he can to create certainty, or are you concerned that there are some aspects of HHS implementation right now that are actually undermining the law, attempting to sort of create more problems in order to, say, force Congress to act? COLLINS: I'm troubled by the uncertainty that has been created by the administration when it comes to the subsidies that are given to very low-income people to help them with their co-pays and their deductibles. I hear this described by some as an insurance company bailout. That\u2019s not what it is. It is vital assistance to people who make between 100 and 250 percent of the poverty level and allows them to afford their out-of-pocket costs. The uncertainty about whether that subsidy is going to continue from month to month is clearly contributing to the destabilization of the insurance markets. And that's one thing that Congress needs to end. We need to make very clear that that subsidy is important to those very low-income people, and we need to appropriate the money to ensure that it continues. TODD: Do you think Senator McConnell needs to give up the reconciliation aspect of trying to deal with health care, that he should pledge, okay, I\u2019m done trying to jam health care through in this way? The process is back to the regular order. Are you there not only encouraging that but are you going to tell Senator McConnell your vote will never be there for him on any of these reconciliation health care bills until he opens up the process? COLLINS: I\u2019ve made very clear that I believe we would produce far better legislation if we went through the normal process of having committee hearings, hearing from health care providers, from insurance regulators, from advocacy groups, from governors, from everyone involved and then produce bipartisan legislation with input from both Democrats and Republicans. That\u2019s how we get the best legislation and that is the best path forward to fix the very real flaws that Democrats and Republicans alike see in the Affordable Care Act. So that's the path that I want to take and that means not going through reconciliation but going through the normal committee processes. I\u2019ve been urging all along and Senator John McCain urged in his very eloquent speech on the Senate floor. TODD: It was something -- you were quoted this week in another report as saying that while Vice President Pence lobbied you and some other administration officials lobbied you that you didn't really hear from the president. When was the last time you heard from the president on health care? COLLINS: Well, I do want to make clear that the president invited me to the two meetings at the White House to talk about health care. At the first meeting where I was seated next to him, he certainly did encourage my support for the bill. That was a few weeks ago. And he asked my opinion on what we could do on a reinsurance pool, which I am particularly interested in to preserve coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and lowering premiums. But most of the input that I\u2019ve had from the White House has been from the vice president and from the administrator of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. TODD: There were a lot of sideshows this week. One of them had to do with a hot mic moment that caught you and Senator Reed talking about first the threat that a Republican member of Congress made at you. Let me -- but there was another portion of the tape that you have not referenced at all. Here it is. REED: Yes, I think he's -- I think he's crazy. And I -- I don't say that. COLLINS: No\u2026lightly. REDD: Lightly as kind of, yeah, you know, a goofy guy. TODD: You appear to be referencing the president there with Senator Reed. Can you expound upon that a little bit. How concerned are you about the president? COLLINS: Actually, what I was talking about is the president's budget. If you go earlier in that tape, I talk about the fact that OMB went through the budget and appeared to zero out many really vital programs without doing a careful analysis of the impact on communities, on vulnerable citizens, on veterans, on people across the United States. So when I said I\u2019m worried, that's what I was referring to. I was referring to the president's budget, and I am worried about the president's budget. As OMB has put it forth, I think there are a lot of problems in it. TODD: And finally, there's been some speculation that the president may ask Attorney General Jeff Sessions to replace John Kelly as Secretary of Homeland Security, but that would essentially be throwing him out of the Department of Justice. Would you support a move like that or would you attempt to block a move like that? COLLINS: Well, obviously it's up to the president whom he wants to have where in his Cabinet, but let me say this: The Attorney General made absolutely the right decision to recuse himself from the Russian investigation. He consulted with the career staff and he followed the exact guidelines of the Justice Department. So for him to be criticized for the decision to remove himself from the investigation, I just don't think is right. TODD: So you would not support any attempt to move Jeff Sessions to DHS? COLLINS: It\u2019s up to Jeff Sessions and the president, but if he's being moved because of his correct decision to recuse himself, I think that's a mistake. I do think that General Kelly will do a good job as the White House Chief of Staff. I think he will bring some order and discipline to the West Wing. TODD: All right, Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine joining us from Bangor. I want to prove to my friends in Maine that I do know how to pronounce the city's name correctly. Senator, thanks for coming on. Thank you for sharing your views. COLLINS: Thank you. We appreciate that."},

Susan M. Collins With its magnificent buildings, monuments, and memorials, Washington is a city of inspiring sights. Just as inspiring was the sea of blue shirts worn by the more than 160 young delegates who participated in a recent hearing that I chaired on how diabetes affects people of all ages and their families. This was the ninth consecutive JDRF Children\u2019s Congress that I have chaired. Our hearing focused on the importance of research to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure Type 1 diabetes. Usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, Type 1 diabetes is a lifelong disease that to date one can never outgrow. That is why it is so important that these young delegates to the Children\u2019s Congress travel to Washington to tell their stories and put a human face on the statistics. As the founder of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have learned a lot about the difficulties and heartbreak that this disease causes for so many American families as they await a cure. Diabetes is a life-long condition that does not discriminate: it affects people of every age, race, and nationality. The statistics are overwhelming. Nearly 30 million Americans have diabetes, including more than one million people who are living with Type 1. In addition to the human toll, diabetes costs the United States an estimated $245 billion a year \u2013 a cost that is projected to more than double by the year 2020. It also accounts for one out of three Medicare dollars. In fact, medical costs for Americans with diabetes are more than double those incurred by individuals without diabetes. Thankfully, there is good news for people with diabetes. Since I started the Senate Diabetes Caucus, funding for diabetes research has more than tripled from $319 million in 1997 to more than a billion dollars this year. As a result, we have seen encouraging developments in the management, treatment, and potential cures for Type 1 diabetes. Moreover, earlier this year, Medicare adopted a policy I have long pushed for to provide coverage for an effective, lifesaving device \u2013 the continuous glucose monitor (CGM) \u2013 that is helping millions of Americans with diabetes who rely on the CGM to successfully manage the disease. Last year, the FDA approved an artificial pancreas system that will revolutionize diabetes care by automatically controlling blood glucose levels. I first held a hearing on the promise of the artificial pancreas to revolutionize diabetes care in September 2006. One program in particular that has led to phenomenal discoveries is the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Special Diabetes Program. This critical program, which led the development of the artificial pancreas, provides $150 million a year for Type 1 diabetes research, in addition to the regular NIH appropriation for diabetes research. The Special Diabetes Program is changing the future of diabetes. It was a great pleasure to welcome the two Children\u2019s Congress delegates from Maine: Charlie Albair of Gray and Brady Chappell of Naples. Charlie testified before the Committee, describing how advancements in technology \u2013 from insulin injections with syringes at first to a glucose pump and now a CGM -- has made managing his diabetes so much easier. \u201cWhen I first found out I had diabetes, I remember thinking that this would change my whole life. I thought that I wouldn\u2019t realize my dream of being a sports star. Now I realize I can do whatever I want.\u201d Charlie urged Senators to continue to support diabetes research, promising that \u201cif you do, I will invite you to a game when I am on the Red Sox.\u201d In addition to hearing testimony from children, a parent, and an NIH researcher, the Committee heard from the actor Paul Sparks, best known for his role in \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d Paul was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes nearly 20 years ago at age 27. He described how in the early years he would have to sneak gulps of orange juice while on stage to maintain his blood glucose level. Today, with inhaled insulin and a CGM, he can manage his diabetes quickly, easily, and safely. \u201cThis research has made a difference in my life,\u201d he told the Senators. \u201cIt has made a difference in the lives of everyone in this room -- and millions more.\u201d It is essential that Congress pass legislation this year to extend the Special Diabetes Program, which otherwise expires in September. This program is critical to our efforts to find better treatments, a means of prevention, and ultimately a cure for diabetes. The Special Diabetes Program has bipartisan support \u2013 in fact, 75 Senators signed a letter that I led last September urging that federal investment in this program continue. By continuing and strengthening this investment, we will one day see a future in which those with Type 1 diabetes, like the courageous and determined Children\u2019s Congress delegates, can look forward to a better and brighter tomorrow."},

We spoke with Mainers everywhere from parades, to grocery store aisles, to airports, to workplaces, to our Maine and D.C. offices about the challenges they faced under the current system and what impact the Senate health care bill would have on their access to affordable health care. \u201cAfter months of conversations and research, we both reached the same inescapable conclusion that the Senate health care bill would have been extremely harmful to our state, particularly to our most vulnerable populations, including children with disabilities and low-income seniors. \u201cEvery version of the Senate plan would have increased the number of uninsured by millions and weakened important consumer protections. Premiums and out-of-pocket costs\u2014which are already too high\u2014also would have skyrocketed.

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cState of the Union\u201d July 16, 2017 TAPPER: My guest, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who joins us now. Thanks so much for joining us, Senator. Appreciate it. COLLINS: Thank you. TAPPER: So, let's start with health care. President Trump is making phone calls to wavering senators. You have said that you're going to vote no on the motion to proceed, just to even debate the matter, and as well as the final passage. Has President Trump called you? Is he still hoping that maybe he can win you over? COLLINS: He talked to me at the White House at a meeting of the Republican Caucus a couple of weeks ago, but I have not heard directly from him. But I have heard from members of his administration, including his chief of staff. Let me just quickly say that all of us are concerned about John McCain, and we're wishing him a speedy recovery. He's very tough, and I'm sure he will be back soon. TAPPER: We all agree with that. Vice President Pence spoke with the nation's governors on Friday. He tried to allay any concerns about what this bill will do with Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans and others. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VP PENCE: Let me be clear. President Trump and I believe the Senate health care bill strengthens and secures Medicaid for the neediest in our society. And this bill puts this vital American program on a path to long-term sustainability. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: Do you agree with the vice president there? Is he telling the truth? Would this bill strengthen Medicaid for the neediest? COLLINS: I would respectfully disagree with the vice president's analysis. This bill would impose fundamental, sweeping changes in the Medicaid program, and those include very deep cuts. That would affect some of the most vulnerable people in our society, including disabled children, poor seniors. It would affect our rural hospitals and our nursing homes. And they would have a very difficult time even staying in existence and serving vulnerable populations. So, no, I see it very differently. You can't take more than $700 billion out of the Medicaid program and not think that it's going to have some kind of effect. TAPPER: One of the major changes to the health care bill was a provision offered by Senator Ted Cruz that would allow insurance companies to sell cheaper plans that offer fewer benefits. You have criticized the provision. Wouldn't the Cruz provision, however, make it possible for some people who can't afford to buy coverage able to buy coverage? COLLINS: I do want to see more flexibility in the insurance market but Senator Cruz's approach is not the answer. It's rare for insurance and consumer groups to agree, but they agree on this. The Cruz plan is unworkable. It would result in undermining the protections for people with pre-existing conditions and create two separate groups of individuals. Some of them would have very skimpy insurance coverage at a low price, but it might not help them when they get sick. And then there would be the group of people who have serious medical problems, and their premiums and deductibles would go sky high, such that insurance would be unaffordable for many of them. There is a way to deal with this, and that is by creating a reinsurance pool for people with pre-existing conditions. That would help drive down premiums. We did it in Maine for 18 months before the Affordable Care Act went into effect, and it was highly successful. TAPPER: Senator, you and Senator Rand Paul, for very different reasons, are opposed to this latest piece of legislation from the Republican leadership in the Senate. Republicans, as you know, can't afford to lose any more votes from the Republican conference on this. Do you think that the bill will pass or do you think there are enough other wavering Republicans that it will not? COLLINS: There are about eight to 10 Republican senators who have serious concerns about this bill. And so at the end of the day, I don't know whether it will pass. But I do know this: We should not be making fundamental changes in a vital safety net program that's been on the books for 50 years, the Medicaid program, without having a single hearing to evaluate what the consequences are going to be. That doesn't mean that there aren't problems with the Medicaid program that need to be addressed. It doesn't mean that the ACA doesn't have serious flaws. It does. But that's why we need go through the normal committee process and get input from people on both sides of the aisle. That's what would produce the kind of legislation that we need. TAPPER: You're also a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is of course investigating the Russia investigation. President Trump came to the defense of Donald Trump Jr. this week after those e-mails were released. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: My son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Not a government lawyer but a Russian lawyer. Most people would have taken that meeting. It's called opposition research. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: You've been through a few campaigns, Senator. If you were told that a lawyer wanted to share information with you as part of the Russian government's effort to help you get elected, how would you respond? COLLINS: Well, I would respond in the negative. And I think most candidates would. We need to get to the bottom of this, but the only way that we're going to do it is to talk not just to Donald Trump Jr., who has offered to cooperate, for which I give him credit, but to everyone who was at that meeting and who was involved in setting up that meeting. That may be difficult in the case of the Russian nationals, but we certainly ought to try. We should also ask for all documents, not just the e-mails that have been released, but all the documents that are related to any contacts that President Trump's campaign had with the Russian government or its emissaries. TAPPER: Of the three people from the Trump team that we know of, who were in that meeting with the Russian lawyer, only one of them, Jared Kushner, is currently in the White House with a security clearance. Given how many times he has had to update his security clearance forms and how empirically untransparent he has been throughout this process, do you have any concerns about his security clearance? COLLINS: That's an issue that we need to look at. But right now we don't have enough evidence. I don't know who advised him on the forms. I don't know how many meetings he had in total. I don't know whether most of them were listed. So those are issues that we do need to review. And it's one reason why the Intelligence Committee's counterintelligence investigation needs to continue. It's on a separate track from the special counsel's investigation which is looking at the issue of whether or not there's any criminal wrongdoing. That's not in our bailiwick, but we do need to make sure we know the answers to Russian interference in the campaign, whether there was any collaboration. And most of all we need to put into place safeguards to prevent this kind of interference from happening in the future. Because the Russians are going to try again, as we know, from their attempts to influence the campaigns in France and in Germany and in Montenegro. TAPPER: All right. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, thank you so much for joining us today. We really appreciate it. Great to see you. COLLINS: Thanks so much."},

It would also jeopardize the very existence of our rural hospitals and our nursing homes, which not only provide essential care to people in rural America, but also are major employers in the small communities in which they are located. And worst of all, these changes would be made without the Senate having held a single hearing to evaluate their impact. KARL: But the vote's been delayed. Did McConnell have the votes to get it passed? COLLINS: I don't know. I think it would be extremely close. There are many of us who have concerns about the bill, particularly the cuts in the Medicaid program. But there are other problems with the bill as well. It could lead to insurance plans that really are barely insurance at all. It would cause premiums to increase for some very vulnerable individuals, including those with preexisting conditions, depending on what states decide to do. So there are a lot of us who have concerns about the bill. On the Senate side, I would estimate that there are about eight to ten Republicans senators who have deep concerns. But how this would all translate out I'm not certain. And I never underestimate Leader McConnell's skills. KARL: That's a good idea. But if you look at Medicaid, which you've mentioned repeatedly on this, isn't Medicaid spending now out of control? If you look at the estimates, Medicaid is estimated to be at nearly a trillion dollars a year by 2025. That's a 70 percent increase in Medicaid spending over the course of a decade. You heard the Vice President. He says that this bill puts Medicaid on a more sustainable path. You'd acknowledge right now it's not on a sustainable path? COLLINS: I would never say that the Medicaid program should not be scrutinized to see if we can lower the costs. I believe there's a good model in Indiana, which applied a managed care approach to the expansion of Medicaid that was done in that state under the Affordable Care Act. That offers a very useful model that I believe could be replicated in other states. But to totally change the program and to set a future inflation rate that we know will not cover the costs of medical care at a time when the Baby Boomer generation is going to be needing those services is not the way we should proceed. Should we proceed to have careful hearings and look at what we can do to make sure that the Medicaid program can continue to be there for future generations without bankrupting the federal budget? Absolutely. But we haven't had that kind of in-depth analysis, public hearings to vet all kinds of ideas that would be useful in lowering costs of the program and producing better outcomes, which is what the Indiana model has done. KARL: So the President says that this must happen, that after seven years of what he calls the \u201cObamacare disaster,\u201d it must happen. Have you heard from him? When was the last time you spoke to the President about this? COLLINS: I spoke to the President at the White House at a meeting that was held of the Republican caucus a few weeks ago. I have been in touch with members of his administration, who have talked to me about the bill. And of course there have been some changes made in the bill, so it still seems to be a work in progress. Let me make clear, I think there are substantial flaws in the Affordable Care Act. It has produced premium increases that are very troubling and difficult for people to afford, particularly those who don't get the subsidies under the current law. And in some counties in some states, the markets are literally collapsing, so that even if you have a subsidy, you're not going to find that there's an insurance policy that you can purchase. So we do need to fix the significant flaws in the current law. But the way to do that is through the normal process of committee hearings and expert witnesses and writing a bill with bipartisan support. President Obama in my view made a serious mistake when he pushed through the Affordable Care Act without a single Republican vote. I don't want to make the same mistake in reverse and push through this bill without a single Democratic vote. KARL: All right, Senator Susan Collins, thank you for joining us. COLLINS: Thank you, Jonathan."},

Senators Collins and King had repeatedly pressed both Departments and USCIS to increase the visa cap so that Maine businesses would be able to hire additional temporary employees to help their businesses operate during the busy summer tourist season. \u201cAlthough this should have happened much earlier, we are pleased to see that Maine businesses will now have the opportunity to hire the additional temporary workers they need to keep their doors open this summer,\u201d  . \u201cWe urge the Department of Labor and Department of Homeland Security to expedite the processing of applications to ensure that Maine businesses are not further harmed by additional delays. \u00a0Every day that passes without these workers threatens Maine businesses and our state\u2019s economy.\u201d Today, USCIS announced that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, in consultation with Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, has submmited a rule to the Federal Register that will allow U.S. businesses in danger of suffering irreparable harm due to a lack of temporary workers will be able to hire up to 15,000 additional employees under the H-2B program. The H-2B program is vital to small and seasonal employers across the country who depend on temporary workers to sustain their businesses and supplement their existing American workforce. \u201cCongress gave me the opportunity to provide temporary relief to American businesses in danger of suffering irreparable harm due to a lack of available temporary workers,\u201d  . \u201cAs a demonstration of the Administration\u2019s commitment to supporting American businesses, DHS is providing this one-time increase to the congressionally set annual cap.\u201d Under current law, the USCIS distributes 66,000 annual H-2B visas to seasonal businesses \u2013 33,000 for each half of the Fiscal Year. That cap was reached on March 13  of this year, with many small businesses in Maine still in need of seasonal employees to support their operations as the summer months approach. On February 27 , Senators Collins and King sent Secretary Kelly and Secretary Acosta   urging them to conduct an audit of any unusued H-2B visas. On March 7 , they joined with a bipartisan group of Senators  . On March 27 , Senator Collins then joined with Senator King and Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) to introduce  , bipartisan legislation that makes substantive reforms aimed to help seasonal employers better navigate the H-2B visa program. The bill would codify a \u201creturning worker exemption\u201d provision, which allows workers who have previously worked in the U.S. through the H-2B visa program to not count against the visa cap. On April 27 , Senators Collins and King sent a bipartisan   to Senate\u00a0 leadership urging them to come to the aid of Maine businesses who are in desperate need of seasonal workers by instituting cap relief. Following that letter, the Senate passed   that allowed the Secretaries Labor and Homeland Security to increase the number of H-2B visas distributed to small businesses. Following the passage of that bill, Senator King led  , also signed by Senator Collins and Representatives Chellie Pingree and Bruce Poliquin, to the Secretaries of Homeland Security and Labor urging them to take immediate action under the authority given to them by Congress to lift the cap. On June 28 , Senators Collins and King signed onto   led by Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.) to Secretary Kelly again urging him to use the authority provided by Congress to lift the cap on seasonal H-2B visas that employers rely on to fill summer jobs.

Upward Bound helps low-income, first-generation, and other students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursue higher education. Earlier this year, due to a minor line spacing issue in UMPI\u2019s original application, the Department of Education prohibited UMPI\u2019s grant application from being reviewed, jeopardizing services to nearly 1,000 students. Following a months-long push led by Senator Collins, the Department of Education reversed this absurd bureaucratic decision and agreed to review UMPI\u2019s full application. \u201cI am absolutely delighted to announce that UMPI has been awarded more than $639,000 for its Upward Bound Program,\u201d   \u201cThe Department of Education\u2019s initial refusal to review this application due to a minor line spacing issue was absurd. It is no surprise that when the Department reversed this decision\u2014after a months-long push from the Maine delegation\u2014and agreed to review the application on the merits, UMPI\u2019s application was selected. This funding will help nearly 1,000 students over the next five years who depend on Upward Bound to pursue their higher education goals.\u201d Senator Collins championed two provisions that were included in the fiscal year 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which provided the Department with the ability to review the Upward Bound applications. The first was an additional $50 million for TRIO for which Senator Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, successfully advocated   last year. The second was language   that \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d the Department \u201cto provide flexibility to [affected] applicants by permitting submission of a corrected application.\u201d Senator Collins worked tirelessly with other members of the Maine delegation and a bipartisan group of Senators to urge the Department of Education to overturn its initial rejection of dozens of Upward Bound applications. In addition to securing additional money for TRIO and pressing for action in the Omnibus, Senator Collins joined Senator King and Representatives Poliquin and Pingree   to Secretary DeVos on April 14th to express their strong concern with the Department\u2019s decision. Moreover, on April 28th, Senator Collins and Senator Jon Tester (D-MT)  signed by 25 Senators, including Senator King, urging the Department of Education to read and score these grant applications. On May 15th, Senators Collins and Tester   signed by 19 Senators, including Senator King, to Secretary DeVos calling her attention to the language Senator Collins authored in the omnibus. The Council for Opportunity in Education recently   to thank her for her leadership in Congress. \u201cThank you for your strong leadership in galvanizing your colleagues in Congress to ensure that students served by TRIO Upward Bound programs across the nation will not miss out on further enrichment opportunities because of bureaucratic oversight,\u201d wrote Maureen Hoyler, the President of the Council for Opportunity in Education. \u201cBecause of your efforts, students who participate in currently funded Upward Bound programs will have the opportunity to continue benefitting from the life-changing academic supportive services provided by TRIO\u2026Without champions like you, the trajectory of the program\u2019s success would have been cut short.\u201d Last month, Senator Collins led 37 Senators   to the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee to advocate for funding for TRIO in the fiscal year 2018 spending bill."},

Employers across our country continue to make decisions to cut employees\u2019 hours due to how the health care law currently defines a \u201cfull-time employee\u201d \u2013 as someone who works an average of 30 hours per week. Employers are making the law\u2019s 30-hour standard part of their business planning, and as a result, employers nationwide are cutting their workers\u2019 hours to 29 hours a week or fewer. The bipartisan legislation would help employees impacted by the current definition of a full-time worker and allow employers to better plan for the future by using the more commonly accepted definition of \u201cfull time\u201d: someone who works 40 hours. \u201cOur legislation is very straightforward and would remedy a serious flaw in the Affordable Care Act that is causing workers to have their hours reduced and their pay cut. The law creates a perverse incentive for businesses to cut their employees\u2019 hours so they are no longer considered \u2018full time.\u2019 Our concerns are not hypothetical: thousands of employers across our country are cutting work hours or staffing levels as a result of the law,\u201d   \u201cThe employees affected by this rule aren\u2019t limited to any one sector. In Maine, I have heard from school employees, restaurant staff, seasonal employees, home care nurses, municipal workers, and many more. Our goal is simple. We want to protect part-time workers from having their hours reduced and their paychecks cut because of the illogical definition of full-time work in this law.\u201d \u201cI believe that we can work together to fix issues with the health care law and improve our health care system,\u201d   \u201cI have heard from part-time workers across many industries, like school cafeteria managers to grocery store employees to adjunct professors at colleges, that have seen their hours cut to comply with the health care law. In Indiana, common sense holds that a full-time employee is someone who works an average of 40 hours a week, and the health care law should reflect that. I\u2019m proud to partner with my friend and colleague Senator Collins to reintroduce the  , and I am hopeful the Senate will consider this bipartisan bill soon.\u201d The   that was reintroduced this week is the same legislation that Senators Collins and Donnelly first introduced in June 2013 and again in 2015."},

Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and can lead to many other chronic diseases and conditions, such as blindness and kidney failure.

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cThis Week\u201d June 25, 2017 STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Susan Collins of Maine. She\u2019s joining us from Washington this morning. You just heard Senator Paul, you heard Kellyanne Conway, you heard Senator Schumer this morning. Is there any way this week for Senator McConnell and President Trump to come up with a bill that both you and Senator Paul can support? COLLINS: It\u2019s certainly going to be very difficult. For my part, I\u2019m very concerned about the cost of insurance for older people with serious chronic illnesses and the impact of the Medicaid cuts on our state governments, the most vulnerable people in our society, and health care providers, such as our rural hospitals and nursing homes, most of whom are very dependent on the Medicaid program. So threading that needle is going to be extremely difficult. STEPHANOPOULOS: You just heard Kellyanne Conway say those are not Medicaid cuts. What is your response to that? COLLINS: Well, I respectfully disagree with her analysis, but this is why we need the Congressional Budget Office assessment of the impact of the Senate bill on costs and coverage, including its analysis of Medicaid, and that will be coming out tomorrow. But based on what I\u2019ve seen, given the inflation rate that would be applied in the outer years to the Medicaid program, the Senate bill is going to have more impact on the Medicaid program than even the House bill. STEPHANOPOULOS: So that means, if that's true, if that is confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office, you're a no? COLLINS: I want to wait to see the CBO analysis, but I have very serious concerns about the bill. STEPHANOPOULOS: You also have concerns about Planned Parenthood. This bill would deny funding of Planned Parenthood for a year. I know you\u2019re planning on introducing an amendment with Senator Murkowski that would restore the funding for Planned Parenthood. If that amendment fails, will you oppose final passage? COLLLINS: Well, first let me say that it makes absolutely no sense to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood. There already are longstanding restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion, so that\u2019s not what this debate is about, and Planned Parenthood is an important provider of health care services, including family planning and cancer screenings for millions of Americans, particularly women. They should be allowed to choose the health provider that they want. That\u2019s one of the issues that I care deeply about, but there are many others as well. I am optimistic we'll prevail on that issue. STEPHANOPOULOS: You think you\u2019ll prevail on the amendment, but if you don't\u2014I understand you have other concerns with the bill as well\u2014is Planned Parenthood funding a bottom line for you? If this bill denies funding to Planned Parenthood, are you against it? COLLINS: It is one of many factors and a very important one that I will consider in casting my vote, but I\u2019m also very concerned about the Medicaid cuts, what it means to our most vulnerable citizens. I am very concerned about the costs of insurance premiums and deductibles, particularly for that very vulnerable group between the age of 50 and 64. They are particularly at risk based on my initial analysis. I\u2019m going to look at the whole bill before making a decision. STEPHANOPOULOS: Are there a critical mass? We know that Senator Paul and three other conservatives want more repeal from their perspective. How many more senators do you believe share your views on Medicaid? COLLINS: Well, there are several of us who have been meeting under the leadership of Senator Rob Portman to look at the Medicaid provisions, and there are about seven to eight people in that group. I can't speak for them, but sufficive to say they are certainly concerned, and that\u2019s why the CBO analysis quantifying the cuts and the impact is going to be so important. You can't take over $800 billion out of the Medicaid program and not expect that it's going to have an impact on a rural nursing home that relies on Medicaid for 70 percent of the costs of its patients. So this is an access issue as well as one having to do with cost. STEPHANOPOULOS: Does the bill pass this week? COLLINS: It\u2019s hard for me to see the bill passing this week, but that's up to the majority leader. We could well be in all night a couple of nights, working through what will be an open amendment process. I think that -- that at least is good. The process could have been a lot better. I would have liked to have seen the Democrats step up to the table and negotiate with us now, not wait until this bill is either passed or defeated. STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Collins, thanks for your time this morning. COLLINS: Thank you, George."},

The company, which the Lancisis founded in 1996, began as a cabinetmaking business and later expanded to manufacture wooden baseball bats as well. Dove Tail Bat Company currently employs nine people who produce each bat at the Shirley manufacturing facility. \u201cI had a wonderful tour of Dove Tail Bat Company, which manufactures bats for Major League Baseball players right here in Maine,\u201d   \u201cBaseball players of all age levels, from Little League to Major League Baseball, use the high-quality bats for everything from training to World Series victories! After seeing the attention to detail and craftsmanship Paul and Theresa Lancisi and their skilled employees use to manufacture each bat, it is no wonder that they are in such high demand.\u201d Dove Tail Bat Company expects to more than double its production of bats to 30,000 this year, up from 14,000 bats in 2016. The catalyst for this tremendous growth was a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), which allowed the Lancisis to construct a building, buy machinery, and increase inventory through the winter. Senator Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, has strongly advocated for the CDBG program, which has helped a number of Maine communities create new economic opportunities. Dove Tail Bat Company uses ash, maple, and birch wood that is grown locally, carefully selected, and hand split at the company\u2019s log mill. The pieces are then sawed into 16-pound blocks, dried in a kiln, and shaved down to a 5-pound cylinder. Finally, the wood is shaped into a 31- or 32-ounce bat and given a durable, clear coat finish. Dove Tail Bat Company is one of only a few dozen Major League Baseball-approved bat makers. Their bats are used by players with the New York Mets, Cleveland Indians, Colorado Rockies and teams in the Philadelphia Phillies minor league system. In the 2015 World Series, 70% of the runs scored were with Dove Tail Bats. Following her visit to Dove Tail Bats, Senator Collins had lunch with members of the Moosehead Lake Regional Economic Development Committee at the Stress Free Moose Caf\u00e9 in Greenville. They discussed ways to support small businesses, create jobs, and grow the economy of the Moosehead Lake Region.

{"title": "Senate Aging Committee Hearing Explores How Nutrition Improves Health Outcomes for Older Americans", "date": ["Posted Wed, 07/12/2017 - 14:47"], "release": "\u00a0In 2014, more than 10 million Americans age 60 and older experienced food insecurity. Approximately half of older adults are at risk or already are malnourished, and food insecurity is estimated to result in more than $51 billion in excess health care expenditures annually. Yet, research shows that appropriate nutrition in seniors promotes better health outcomes from reducing falls and diabetes to improving mobility and cardiovascular function. Senior nutrition was the focus of a hearing in the Senate Aging Committee today. The hearing, led by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bob Casey (D-PA), the Chairman and Ranking Member, examined the importance of proper nutrition for seniors, public health perspectives on food security and hunger in seniors, and the challenges that arise with changing demographics. It also highlighted the work done by various public and private programs aimed at providing proper nutrition for seniors. \u201cSeniors in Maine and across the nation are increasingly finding themselves forced to choose between buying food and paying essential bills,\u201d   \u201cFederal programs that help keep food banks stocked and meals delivered to seniors play a critical role, as do private partners. As Americans grow older, proper nutrition will become even more critical to maintaining long and healthy lives.\u201d Without adequate access to nutritious foods, older adults are at an increased risk for poor physical and mental health outcomes. With targeted nutrition programs, however, the health outcomes for older Americans can be improved. Elizabeth Pratt, Program Manager of the Maine Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Education Program (SNAP-Ed) at the University of New England, testified on the importance of teaching seniors to shop, cook, and eat healthy meals on a budget. She explained how the program complements SNAP this way: \u201cSNAP gives a family a fish, while SNAP-Ed teaches a family to fish.\u201d SNAP-Ed has reached more than 3,000 seniors in Maine through integrated programs in rural and urban adult training sites, grocery stores, elderly service centers, public housing sites, and churches. Pat Taylor of Penn Hills, PA, testified that programs like Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CFSP), which she and her husband rely on, are vital to ensure proper nourishment in a time of life where costs are rising. She spoke about her own experience, saying, \u201cAs we have gotten older, our health care costs have taken up a greater share of the bills, and we were forced to struggle because of our healthcare expenses\u2026 It was not easy to ask for help with our food expenses. When talking with other adults in our age bracket, we learned about a food pantry in our neighborhood.\u201d Two researchers provided expert testimony on the importance of making senior nutrition a priority. Dr. Connie Bales of the Duke University School of Medicine shed light on a new trend in malnutrition: the obesity epidemic. She testified, \u201ccontrary to what people may believe, being overweight or obese does not correspond with over-nutrition. In fact, obesity is a marker of malnutrition.\u201d Almost 40 percent of older Americans are obese, and if trends continue, we will face a major crisis. Dr. Seth Berkowitz of Harvard Medical School explained how the impact is tremendous \u2013 malnutrition and food insecurity cost our health care system billions and ultimately increase mortality by approximately 30 percent. Medically tailored meals, however, have the potential to save money \u2013 an average of $6,500 annually in a single individual and more importantly, to significantly improve health care outcomes. Dr. Berkowitz, testified that expanding food security and nutrition programs for seniors \u201cwill promote healthy aging and improve the public\u2019s health.\u201d Click   to read the witnesses\u2019 testimonies."},

The report also highlights the importance of improving access to drug-take back programs, which I strongly support because they reduce diversion of prescription opioids into the wrong hands.\u201d Last year, Senator Collins chaired a hearing of the Senate Aging Committee, which explored how the opioid epidemic is affecting older Americans. In 2012, 12.3 million Medicare beneficiaries filled more than 76 million opioid prescriptions.

The resolution was a cap to the celebratory week that ran September 10th through the 16th. Direct Support Professionals (DSPs) are an invaluable part of our nation's health care system, caring for the most vulnerable Americans, including the chronically ill, seniors, and those living with a disability. With the help of Direct Support Professionals, these individuals can perform daily activities that many people take for granted, such as eating, bathing, dressing, and leaving the house. The work of Direct Support Professionals ensures that these individuals can be active participants in their communities. \u201cDirect Support Professionals play an essential role in our communities by providing those in need with critical support that leads to more independent living and a better quality of life,\u201d   \u201cThe \u2018National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week\u2019 Resolution ensures that these professionals are getting the recognition they deserve. I was pleased to join Senator Cardin in co-authoring this resolution, and I thank all National Direct Support Professionals for their hard work and dedication.\u201d \u201cAs our population continues to grow and age, the demand for DSPs and other home-and community-based services will increase to address evolving health care needs. We are incredibly fortunate to have millions of service-oriented Americans who are willing to rise to the task of becoming a Direct Support Professional,\u201d  \u201cI thank Maryland\u2019s Direct Support Professionals and the many more across America for all they do to ensure our families, friends and neighbors can live with dignity and comfort. The quality of home and community-based services and overall patient experience truly lies in their hands.\u201d According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the employment of DSPs is projected to grow by an average of 26 percent from 2014 to 2024, compared to a seven percent average growth rate for all occupations during that period. Unfortunately, direct support professionals are often forced to leave the jobs they love due to low wages and excessive, difficult, work hours. Many Direct Support Professionals rely on public benefits, and some must work multiple jobs in order to provide for themselves and their families. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we work to ensure that these hard-working individuals have the income and emotional support they need and deserve. In addition to Senators Collins and Cardin, the resolution marking Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week was cosponsored by Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Angus King (I-Maine), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)."},

Community health centers serve a critical role in communities throughout the United States and are important safety net providers. If Congress allows the Community Health Centers Fund (CHCF) to lapse, it would immediately threaten patient access to the cost-effective primary and preventive care health centers provide. We respectfully request you take immediate action to address CHCF funding. Community health centers have long enjoyed strong bipartisan support. Since their initial creation over fifty years ago, community health centers have been a critical component of the nation\u2019s primary care network, today serving approximately 26 million patients at over 10,000 sites throughout the United States. Community health centers operate in both rural and urban areas, in every state in the nation, and are an important part of the health care ecosystem of their communities. Last year, health centers were the medical home for one in twelve Americans, one in ten children, one in six Americans living in rural areas, and more than 330,000 of our nation\u2019s veterans. Congress\u2019 previous investments in the community health center program have yielded real results and vastly improved the health and well-being of countless communities throughout the United States. Without extension of the CHCF, community health centers will lose seventy percent of their funding. This will result in an estimated 2,800 site closures, the loss of 50,000 jobs, and result in 9 million Americans losing their access to care. Along with the health center impact, the National Health Service Corps and the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education programs are at risk of expiry. As small businesses, health centers need predictability to secure financing for capital projects, to sign contracts, to recruit and retain providers and staff, and to sustain operations. We are already hearing of the disruptive effects of the uncertainty created by the impending funding cliff on health center operations\u2014this disruption will increase significantly without an extension of funding by September 30. We believe the strong bipartisan support the community health center program receives every year is a strong indicator of the importance of the program to the nation. We stand ready to work with you to ensure that the CHCF continues to be a vibrant program that has improved the health and well-being of many of our nation\u2019s most vulnerable individuals and communities. Thank you for your consideration of our thoughts. We stand ready to work with you to fund the community health center program to ensure no losses in health care access for the millions of Americans served by community health centers."},

Senator Collins pressed Dr. Gottlieb to support policies that prevent opioids from being overprescribed, a key contributor to the heroin and opioid abuse epidemic. She also emphasized the importance of improving generic drug competition to ensure that patients have access to affordable medication. Senator Collins has long raised the concern that the vast supply of prescription opioids currently in circulation is contributing to the heroin and opioid abuse crisis. Following Senator Collins\u2019 advocacy, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recently   that inadvertently encouraged physicians to overprescribe opioid pain relievers. At today\u2019s hearing, Senator Collins asked Dr. Gottlieb to describe additional ways to reduce this practice. \u201cMedicaid beneficiaries are prescribed pain relievers at a higher rate than those with other sources of insurance, and they also, not surprisingly given the higher rate, have a higher risk of overdose...,\u201d   \u201cWhat opportunities do you see for greater collaboration among the FDA, CMS, state Medicaid directors, medical societies, and other parties in order to address this problem of appropriate prescribing of opioids?\u201d  \u201c\u2026at the top of the list of things that we\u2019re looking at right now\u2026\u201d   \u201cAs part of the steering committee we\u2019ve set up, we\u2019re currently having discussions about what steps we can take to improve provider education and maybe take a look at packaging as well, as a way to help make sure prescriptions more appropriately match the circumstances in which they\u2019re being written.\u201d In addition, Senator Collins asked Dr. Gottlieb to detail potential solutions to help keep prescription drugs affordable. Senator Collins, the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, led the only   into the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to egregious price spikes for certain off-patent drugs. In one case, a company that purchased an off-patent drug it had played absolutely no role in developing raised its price by 5,000 percent overnight. \u201cAs you know from our numerous discussions, the Senate Aging Committee last year undertook a major investigation examining the explosion in prices of off-patent prescription drugs for which there is no generic equivalent\u2026By one estimate in 2014, such abuses resulted in increased costs to consumers of $5.4 billion per year,\u201d   \u201cI know that you\u2019ve testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee and noted your concern about this type of anticompetitive behavior.

Thank you for your continued public service.

They say \u201cYet, nearly six months after the designation,\u201d and they mean the designation of election systems as critical infrastructure, \u201cAnd in spite of comments by DHS that they are rushing to establish election protections, no secretary of state is currently authorized to receive classified threat information\u2026\u201d that would help them to protect their election systems. Why not? MANFRA: Thank you ma\u2019am for that question. I would note that this community, the secretaries of state, and for those states where they have a state election director, is not one that the department has historically engaged with. And what we have done in the process of building the trust and learning about how they do their work and how we can assist, we have identified the need to provide clearances to that community. And so we have committed to them to work through that process between our department and the FBI. COLLINS: Let me ask you about your own agency, which is the agency that focuses on critical infrastructure, including our election systems. Now MPPD is not an official element of the intelligence community that would have routine access to especially sensitive classified information. So how do you know with any certainty whether you and others in the agency are read into all the relevant classified information that may exist regarding foreign threats to our critical infrastructure, including our election systems? MANFRA: Yes, ma\u2019am, I would say despite the fact that we are not a part of the intelligence community and our focus is on network defense and operations and partnership with critical infrastructure in the federal government, we feel very confident that with the partnership, with our own intelligence analysis division that serves as an advocate for us within the intelligence community, as well as our direct relationships with many of those individuals in organizations such as the FBI, NSA, and others, that we receive information quickly and when we ask to declassify that, they are responsive, and we work through our partners at the intelligence analysis office to ensure that that happens quickly. So, is there room for improvement? Absolutely, of course. But we have the full commitment of the intelligence community to support us and get us the information that we need and our stakeholders need. COLLINS: And finally, how many states have implanted all the best practices recommended in the document developed by DHS regarding the protection of election systems? MANFRA: Ma\u2019am, I\u2019d have to get back to you on a specific number of states I don\u2019t have that. COLLINS: Do you think most states have? MANFRA: In our informal engagement, many of them noted that they had already adopted some of these, and to the extent that they weren\u2019t, they were incorporating them. COLLINS: I would ask for a response for the record. That\u2019s a really important point."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cMeet the Press Daily\u201d June 22, 2017 TODD: Senator Collins, nice to talk to you. COLLINS: Thank you. TODD: So, we\u2019ve heard criticism from the right, from the more conservative wing of your party. You heard Rand Paul; he believes there\u2019s too much subsidy in here, it still looks too much like Obamacare. I look at this bill, Senator, and it looks a lot different from what you and Senator Bill Cassidy were proposing way back when on this show when you said it is essentially a bill that would allow states, if you like Obamacare, you can keep it. Where are you on this bill because it does not look like it\u2019s a if you like Obamacare, you can keep it? COLLINS: No, I agree that it does not fit that description, and I still believe that the bill that Bill Cassidy and I introduced was a better path forward and ultimately would have attracted bipartisan support, and that\u2019s what we really need when we\u2019re tackling an issue as difficult as health care is. I\u2019m still going through the text of the bill, and of course we still don\u2019t have the all-important CBO analysis of the effect on coverage, on the cost of premiums, and the impact of the Medicaid changes. But I do have concerns, particularly in the area of Medicaid, and I am worried about what the impact will be on people who are very vulnerable and have health care needs. TODD: So that means, are you talking about those folks that are in that just above the poverty line but not\u2014right now, under this bill\u2014would not get a subsidy, under Obamacare would have gotten, depending on the state, would have gotten some coverage? COLLINS: Well, \u201cdepending on the state\u201d is the keyword. This bill would phase out the expansion of Medicaid to cover that very vulnerable low-income population. Now the good news is in the Senate bill is that population will for the first time be eligible for a subsidy for their insurance if they make below $12,000 a year, and right now in a state that did not expand Medicaid they get no help whatsoever. So that is a good provision that\u2019s an improvement over the current law and the House bill. But there are deep Medicaid cuts down the road, and I am really concerned about what the impact of those cuts will be on the individuals who were covered as well as rural hospitals and other health care providers. TODD: Look this bill, the House version of this bill, and if you want to say differently, go ahead. But it seems to me they are more similar than they are different, the Senate and the House bill. What we learned from the Congressional Budget Office on the House bill, their big concern was, while they said yes, this would lower premiums, that the cost of health care would go up, the individual cost to people, so while premiums would go down, your out-of-pocket costs would likely increase. How does this bill address that in the Senate? COLLINS: My analysis is that out-of-pocket costs would increase under the Senate bill as well. That\u2019s one of my major concerns, we\u2019ll have to see what CBO says, but under the House bill, as you know, for that very vulnerable group between the age of 50 and 64, living in northern Maine and with an income of only $26,400, there would be as much as an 800 percent increase in premiums as well as higher deductibles and copays. We can\u2019t have that happen. We are still waiting for the analysis from CBO to see what the impact will be. Do keep in mind that the Senate bill does adjust for income, which the House bill did not. TODD: Let me ask you this, though. Look, you laid out an argument of why you are not in favor of this bill. How much\u2014what is the personal level of, like, well, I don't like this bill but I will support it. What is that line for you as a Republican as Mitch McConnell says to you, don't be the only vote\u2014don\u2019t be the last vote that kills this. We know you don't like half of it. Is it the Planned Parenthood amendment? What is your line in the sand? COLLINS: Well, I can\u2019t support a bill that's going to greatly increase premiums for older Americans or out-of-pocket costs for those who aren\u2019t quite old enough for Medicare yet. I cannot support a bill that's going to result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance. And I cannot support a bill that is going to make such deep cuts in Medicaid that it's going to ship billions of dollars of costs to our state governments, to those who have insurance, and to health care providers such as rural hospitals, which would be faced with a great deal of uncompensated care. So it isn\u2019t any one factor. I do care also about funding Planned Parenthood. But it is all of those factors put together that'll influence my decision. Until I\u2019ve got the\u2014 TODD: Can you imagine enough amendments passing that it would fulfill those pledges you just made? COLLINS: Well, it is going to be an open amendment process, and I am sure many of us are going to have amendments. In addition, I want to see that CBO analysis because I don't know the exact impact yet. TODD: All right, well then Senator Collins I will leave it there. As always, very thoughtful on this issue. I appreciate you coming on and sharing your views. COLLINS: Thank you, Chuck."},

As you know, the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2017 signed into law in early May provided the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, with the authority to approve nearly double the existing cap of 66,000 H-2B visas. Many of us wrote to you following passage of that bill to urge you to lift the cap. We applaud the announcement last week by DHS that you have decided to lift the cap on visas available to seasonal workers this summer. This important step\u00a0will help businesses hire the workers they need during the summer.\u00a0 However, we are concerned by reports that the number of additional H-2B visas approved will be far lower than the number authorized by Congress, and may be as low as 18,500. We are also concerned that the timeline for approving H-2B applications would hinder businesses\u2019 ability to hire the employees they need and leave them without help until late in the summer season. According\u00a0to DHS, these visas likely won\u2019t be approved until late July at the earliest\u2014meaning that applications are not likely to be through the multi-agency approval process until mid-August.\u00a0 Businesses in our states, particularly in our tourism industries, rely on the H-2B visa program to hire extra workers in the summer tourism season, when demand is greatest. The delay in approving additional visas during much of the peak season could hurt local employers\u2019 ability to keep their businesses going and meet demand. We respectfully\u00a0urge you to use the authority provided by Congress to increase the number of H-2B visas available to seasonal workers, and to work with the Department of Labor to ensure that visas are available as soon as possible.

The Flight III ship will incorporate the SPY-6 Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) and upgrade the electrical power and cooling capacity plus additional associated changes. \u201cThese contracts to construct two new DDG-51 class destroyers in Bath demonstrates the Navy\u2019s commitment to BIW and its confidence in the highly skilled, hard-working employees at the shipyard. There is no workforce in the world better positioned to build these ships,\u201d   \u201cAs the workhorses of the Navy, destroyers\u2019 ability to deliver capability and presence has been demonstrated many times over.

The additional destroyer was included on the Navy\u2019s list of unmet requirements. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator King worked to authorize more than $5.62 billion for the Navy destroyer programs in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), including more than $5 billion for the procurement of three DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyers in fiscal year 2018 that Bath Iron Works can compete to build. He also helped secure authorization of $90.5 million for the continued production of DDG-1000 Zumwalt-class destroyers, all of which are built at Bath. The Senate passed the 2018 NDAA earlier in September by a vote of 89-8. As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, Congresswoman Pingree has worked with her colleagues over the past several years to advocate for the funding for the DDG-51 class destroyer program in the House passed bills. In particular, she has educated her House colleagues about the importance of accepting the funding included by Maine\u2019s Senators in the Senate FY16 bill to provide an additional DDG-51 destroyer. She was successful in her efforts in June of this year to secure language in the FY18 Department of Defense Appropriations bill to clarify the intent of the Congress on the construction of the additional DDG-51. Because the Navy expects to release a competitive solicitation for additional DDG 51 class ships in the Flight III configuration in future years, the contract award amount is considered source selection sensitive information and is not being made public at this time. At present, the Navy has 280 deployable battle force ships, well short of the new goal set by the Navy in December for 355 ships."},

In 2016, Maine experienced a record 376 overdose deaths, an increase of 38 percent over the previous year. This alarming statistic averages out to more than one overdose death a day and exceeds the number of deaths from car accidents, suicide, or breast cancer. During the hearing, Senator Collins referenced   on the Maine Municipal Association\u2019s annual convention, where first responder officials discussed their concern about the growing drug epidemic in Maine. \u201cThis morning\u2019s headline in the largest newspaper in the State of Maine says this, \u2018Portland, Falmouth officials deliver bleak report on opioid crisis: \u2018It\u2019s getting worse,\u2019\u201d   \u201cAnd this headline disturbed me greatly because I feel there has been so much focus on the opioid problem. This epidemic is tearing apart our communities and costing the lives of so many.\u201d Senator Collins observed that Congress has passed legislation and increased funding to address the opioid abuse crisis, but \u201cwe seem not to be making the kind of progress that we need to make.\u201d She asked each of the hearing witnesses to discuss which efforts are working and which are not in order to improve the federal government\u2019s effectiveness at addressing this issue. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said he believed his agency could have \u201can outsized impact\u201d at \u201ctrying to reduce the rate of new addiction by taking steps to decrease the overall rate of exposure to opioids.\u201d The FDA is seeking to accomplish this by \u201cfirst and foremost, changing prescribing behaviors among physicians.\u201d Dr. Francis Collins, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, echoed Dr. Gottlieb\u2019s comments, but noted that there must be \u201calternatives to opioids for those 25 million people who do suffer from chronic pain.\u201d Consequently, the NIH is accelerating its efforts to advance research into non-addictive, but highly effective, pain medicines. Other witnesses highlighted the importance of prescription drug monitoring and integrating addiction treatment into primary care. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Collins has continuously urged Congress to increase investment in addiction treatment services. Last July,  , and President Obama signed into law, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA). The legislation, which was cosponsored by Senator Collins, is an evidence-based response to combat the heroin and opioid epidemic. In addition, last month Senator Collins announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee   \u2013 a $665 million increase over the past two years \u2013 for the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) opioid abuse treatment and prevention programs. The bill directs $500 million to state opioid crisis grants, which were authorized through the 21st Century Cures Act, a bill that was championed by Senator Collins and signed into law in December 2016. Earlier this year, Senator Collins   to the State of Maine through funding that was authorized under this law."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cKasie DC\u201d October 15, 2017 HUNT: After months of rumors and speculation, Maine Senator Susan Collins announced on Friday that she has decided not to run for governor of Maine and will instead stay in Washington with the rest of us in the Senate, where she has become a crucial swing vote as a powerful moderate Republican. Senator Collins joins me now on set. Senator Collins, thank you so much for taking the time to be here with us tonight. COLLINS: Thank you, and congratulations on your new show. HUNT: Thank you. I really appreciate it. Let's start with health care. This is something that the president brought up at the end of the week last week by canceling these CSR payments, and it is obviously an issue that you have come to be squarely in the center of. What do you think is realistic for what the Congress can actually accomplish on health care? COLLINS: I\u2019m actually optimistic that the work of Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray is going to bear fruit. On the Senate Health Committee, on which I serve, we\u2019ve had four hearings. They were in depth, meaty, substantive hearings on what we should do to fix the flaws that are in the Affordable Care Act. HUNT: But McConnell kind of shut all of that down when they decided to try again, right? COLLINS: That's true, but then when the bill that was authored by Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy was not approved, those negations in committee have restarted. And they are absolutely critical now that the president has decided to cut off the subsidies that help lower income people afford their out-of-pocket costs. HUNT: And is there a sense that the president would go along with something like that? Would he sign a bill that would just address what Alexander and Murray are talking about? COLLINS: They are going to have a more comprehensive bill than just restoring the help for low-income people with their deductibles and co-pays. And my belief is that the president wants to sign a health care bill, and this is a good one. It reflects input from both sides of the aisle, and I\u2019m hopeful that he will do so. HUNT: I want to ask you about what was very long -- I remember asking you multiple times in the hallways about what you were going to do, were you going to stay or go. What ultimately kept you here in the Senate? There are so many people who, quite frankly, feel like the atmosphere here is incredibly toxic, and they don\u2019t want anything to do with it anymore. Did you feel that way? Is that why you were thinking of leaving? COLLINS: I was thinking of leaving for many reasons. One is that I missed being in Maine full time. Most of my family and many of my friends are there, and governor is a more hands-on job, where you can promote more economic opportunities, and that really matters to me. But then I looked at all that is going on in Washington today. The issues that we are dealing with are so consequential. I do play a key role as being one of those senators who can work across the aisle and actually get things done. And I just felt that I couldn't walk away even though it's a very difficult and troubled time in Washington. HUNT: The kind of perception after the health care debate was that you along with Senator Lisa Murkowski, and ultimately John McCain as well, were kind of the thin red line against the repeal of Obamacare. Is that a mantle that you shoulder with honor or do you as a Republican\u2014you must have argued with Mitch McConnell about this at some length\u2014it had to be a tough position to be in. COLLINS: It was a tough position because I think there are a lot of flaws in the Affordable Care Act, and those flaws need to be fixed. I have introduced bills myself that are bipartisan bills that would help our insurance markets operate better, that would lower premiums for people, and that would fix a lot of the other problems in the law. And that's what we should be concentrating on. Most frustrating to me is neither the ACA nor any of the Republican alternatives did anything about the underlying costs of health care. And that's the huge issue that none of these bills nor the current law really addressed. HUNT: You were one of just a few women senators in Congress; there are still not equal representation of women compared to the population, of course, by a large margin. Is there a difference between being a woman senator in Trump\u2019s Washington than there has been in the past? COLLINS: I haven't really thought of it that way, and I don't think I see a big difference, but I do see a difference now that we have more women in the Senate. When I was elected to the Senate, believe it or not, I was only the 15th woman in history to be elected in her own right. There were many others who have been appointed, usually after the death of their husbands. But three of those were from the great State of Maine, something we're very proud of. What I have noticed is that you still have to prove yourself if you're a woman who is elected to the Senate. If you're a man and you are elected, it's assumed that you belong there, but women have to prove themselves. I do want to say, we don't think alike. We span the ideological spectrum just as our male counterparts do. HUNT: Do you think President Trump treats women well? COLLINS: I've been disappointed in the way that he treated women during the campaign. I think he has appointed very good women like Nikki Haley to very important positions. I've been impressed with several of his appointments, and I haven't seen what I saw on the campaign now that he's president. He seems to be more equal opportunity in his comments about people. HUNT: Lastly, very quickly because we\u2019re going to have to wrap up, Harvey Weinstein, the allegations have rocked Hollywood. What is your view of what should happen now? Should Congress take a look at nondisclosure agreements, for example, in employment contracts that are becoming an issue around this? Is that something Congress could look at to try and make this better? COLLINS: Well, it seems to me this is primarily a law enforcement issue given the rape allegations and that's where most of the focus should be, but certainly it's something that would be good for Congress to take a look at because this is far too prevalent not just in Hollywood but elsewhere. HUNT: Senator Susan Collins, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us tonight. I really appreciate it. COLLINS: Thank you."},

Senator, thank so much for joining us today. COLLINS: Thank you, Jake. TAPPER: Let's begin right there. By scrapping these subsidies to health insurance companies, is President Trump, as Steve Bannon said, blowing up Obamacare? COLLINS: Jake, the debate in Washington has been on whether or not to repeal and replace Obamacare in the future. What the president is doing is affecting the ability of vulnerable people to receive health care right now. This is not a bailout of the insurers. What this money is used for is to help low-income people afford their deductibles and their co-pays so that their health care is available to them. In addition, the president has taken steps to cut off funding to reach people who are eligible for subsidies under the ACA. So, these certainly are very disruptive moves that will result in smaller numbers of people being insured, that will make it more difficult for low-income people to afford their out-of-pocket costs, and that will destabilize the insurance markets. TAPPER: Not to put too fine a point on it, Senator, but you're saying President Trump is taking actions that will hurt American citizens. COLLINS: I do believe that. I'm very concerned about what the impact is going to be for people who make under 250 percent of the federal poverty level because the funding that is available under the cost-sharing reductions is used to subsidize their out-of-pocket costs. And if they can't afford their deductible, then their insurance is pretty much useless. TAPPER: Let's turn to the Iran deal, another part of the Obama legacy that President Trump is trying to dismantle. Back in 2015, you called Obama\u2019s Iran nuclear accord, quote, fundamentally flawed. Now that President Trump is punting this issue to Congress, are you willing\u2014do you think it would be wise\u2014to vote for additional sanctions on Iran that would kill the existing deal? COLLINS: Well, I think it's important to distinguish between what the president did and did not do. He has the authority to reimpose the sanctions unilaterally. He did not choose to do that. Instead, he put a spotlight on two very important flaws in the agreement. One is the fact that it does not stop Iran from testing and developing ballistic missiles. Second, he put emphasis on the sunsets that are included in the agreement. Those are important because it means that Iran merely has to be patient in order to ultimately design and develop a nuclear arsenal. So, I think there are real deficiencies in the agreement, and I believe that we should take advantage of this window to do two things: One is to see if we can strengthen the agreement to address those two flaws in particular and, second, and this is important, the administration needs to consult with our allies because this was a multilateral agreement, not a bilateral one. TAPPER: Okay. But as of right now, you wouldn't be in favor of voting right now to impose new sanctions on Iran to essentially blow up the deal. You just want to strengthen the deal and work with allies? COLLINS: I want to strengthen the deal and work with allies, but I want to see what the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u2014both of whose leaders, Senator Corker and Senator Cardin, opposed the agreement that the Obama administration negotiated\u2014come up with for legislation. And we have a window to do that. TAPPER: Speaking of Senator Corker, he called the White House a, quote, adult day care center this week. He warned that the president's recklessness could set the nation, quote, on the path to World War III. He said his concerns are shared by nearly every Republican in the United States Senate. Is he right? COLLINS: First, let me say I have enormous respect for Senator Corker. His office is right down the hall from mine. We're friends. And he is a very valuable leader of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The president has surrounded himself with very good and experienced members of his national security team. And I think what the president needs to realize is that his words really matter. When he makes an off-the-hand comment like the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d as he did recently, both our enemies and our allies analyze that comment to figure out what it means. He does not have the luxury that he had when he was in the private sector of saying whatever comes into his mind. So, I don't think the Twitter war is particularly productive, but the president needs to remember that his every word he speaks matters now that he is president of the United States. TAPPER: Just to read between the lines there, you didn't say you disagree with Senator Corker, but I do want to ask you about your big announcement this week that you're not going to run for governor of Maine, you're going to stay in the United States Senate. Are you staying in the Senate, in part, because the Republican Party, in your view, needs more officials like you who are willing to serve as an independent check on President Trump? COLLINS: I'm staying in the Senate because I believe that's where I can do most for the people of Maine and for the nation. The issues we're dealing with now are so consequential. They're so important, whether it's dealing with the threat from North Korea or frustrated families who need tax reform. The issues are just huge right now. This has been an unconventional presidency, and I think that my ability to work with people on both sides of the aisle in a bipartisan way is needed now more than ever. In making my decision, I talked with three friends who have served in both roles: Angus King, my colleague from Maine; Judd Gregg, former senator and governor from New Hampshire; and Lamar Alexander, senator from Tennessee and former governor of that state. They helped me walk through this issue, and their advice and counsel, along with the many opinions I received from family, friends, and constituents in Maine led me to my decision. TAPPER: All right, well we're glad that we\u2019re going to have a few more years of having you as a guest on our shows. Thank you so much, Senator Collins. COLLINS: Thank you, Jake."},

The attraction of being in Maine full-time, close to much of my family and many of my friends was very strong.

I remember talking to Sen. McCain in January or February and saying, \u201cIt's extraordinary. Of all the sacrifices you've made for this country, this may be your greatest contribution right now because there's so much chaos in Washington.\u201d Do you feel like what you are doing right now is as substantial and as important as anything you've done in your decades of public service? COLLINS: I really do. These are chaotic times in Washington and Washington reflects the division and the discord that we see throughout our country. The polarization has never been greater. And yet, I remain a congenital optimist that as the pendulum will swing back and if those of us who are in the middle leave, I worry who will lead that effort to bring us back and get things done for the American people in a way that is less partisan and that invites input by both Republicans and Democrats. I would say, however, I would never begin to compare myself to John McCain, who has done so much for our country. STEVE RATTNER, MSNBC ECONOMIC ANALYST, FORMER TREASURY OFFICIAL: Senator, it's Steve Rattner. As you well know, there are more than a dozen things the president has done in the last few months that are likely to diminish enrollments in the ACA or otherwise impede people getting health care. You've spoken out against some of them. I assume you're probably unhappy with most all of them. But what, if anything, can you do to actually change the course of what's happening and try to preserve health care that is in jeopardy for millions of Americans at the moment? COLLINS: What we should do is immediately pass legislation that's been negotiated by Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, who heads the Senate Health Committee, which I'm a member of, which would help to lower premiums, stabilize the markets, and give clear authorization for the cost-saving reductions that are essential to help low-income people pay their out-of-pocket costs. And that's a package that I believe can garner support on both sides of the aisle, and I hope that the president would sign it into law. BRZEZINSKI: Yamiche -- YAMICHE ALCINDOR, REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Senator Collins, I want to ask you about being a woman on the hill. Yesterday, I was talking to some colleagues about the culture on the hill and with Harvey Weinstein, and we're talking all about the culture of Hollywood and women essentially being sexually assaulted or sexually harassed. Have you heard about that culture in D.C.? Have you, yourself, experienced anything like that? And what do you say to people who say Capitol Hill might need to look at its own culture? COLLINS: It's always good for an organization to review its own culture to make sure that equality and justice prevail throughout. I have not experienced that but undoubtedly, we know from some press accounts that it has happened before. And it is reprehensible, regardless of the working environment in which it occurs. Regardless of whether it's Hollywood or Washington or Main Street America. And I believe that these brave women coming forth and confronting one of the most powerful individuals in Hollywood will help others speak out about their experience and send a very clear message that this is not tolerated. I will say that I do think that when women are elected to the United States Senate that we do face an extra barrier that men do not. When a man is elected to the Senate it's assumed that he belongs there. My experience has been that we women have to prove that we belong there and once we do that we're accepted. But there is an extra barrier that I've found. BRZEZINSKI: Interesting. Steve Schmidt -- STEVE SCHMIDT, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Senator, good morning. Your colleague, Bob Corker, a man -- serious, sober, not given to hyperbole -- has talked quite critically, quite openly about this administration worrying about the president's capacity to start World War III. We have the secretary of state talking about the negotiations will continue until the first bombs drop. How concerned are you and how legitimate do you find Sen. Corker's criticism behaviorally of this administration? How worried are you? COLLINS: Let me say first that I'm a friend of Bob Corker's. I think he's an excellent senator and a great leader of the Foreign Committee, and he knows a great deal. I don't think the Twitter war between him and the president is productive and I'd like to see them get back to working on the Iran legislation, for example. But there's no doubt that this president's been extremely unconventional in his approach and that has caused more chaos than I think is good for our country and for our relationship with both our allies and our enemies. I would urge the president to remember that every single word that he says matters. When he was in the private sector and the business world, he could make an off-the-hand comment, and it really didn't matter. Even as a candidate, it could be excused because he was running for political office. But he is now President of the United States of America, and every word that he says counts. And that's why I'd encourage him to be more careful with his rhetoric because of the signal\u2014the inadvertent signal\u2014that it may send not only to Americans but to our adversaries and our allies around the world. BRZEZINSKI: For sure. Senator Susan Collins, thank you so much."},

{"title": "Senator Collins Questions Experts on Ways to Lower Prescription Drug Costs", "date": ["Posted Tue, 10/17/2017 - 14:18"], "release": "\u00a0Today, the Senate Health Committee held the second hearing in a series on reducing the cost of prescription drugs. The hearing examined the facts about drug spending, the actual consumer costs, and inefficiencies that can be eliminated to lower costs for patients while continuing development of innovative new cures and treatments. U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a member of the Senate Health Committee and the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, has championed bipartisan efforts in Congress to increase the affordability and accessibility of prescription drugs. During the hearing, Senator Collins referenced a   by NBC \u201cNightly News,\u201d which revealed that some contracts between pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacies prohibit pharmacists from telling consumers if their prescription would cost less if they paid for it out of pocket rather than using their insurance. \u201cLast night, NBC \u2018Nightly News\u2019 ran a story about an investigation which found that a wide variety of prescription drugs on certain insurance plans are actually cheaper when the consumer pays out of pocket,\u201d   \u201cHow common is this practice and how can this occur? How can it occur that a prescription benefit manager, whose very job is to negotiate prices, is negotiating a price that's actually higher than the consumer would pay out of pocket? \u201cTo answer your question, it's not something that should be going on in the marketplace,\u201d   \u201cIt is an outlier behavior\u2026it\u2019s not something that we support\u2026If it's a generic that costs $5 and it\u2019s a $20 co-pay, [the consumer] should pay $5.\u201d  echoed Mr. Merritt\u2019s comments, stating, \u201cPharmacists are incredibly frustrated with their inability to help patients. Providing patient care shouldn't be this difficult. My members feel incredibly frustrated with their lack of connectivity\u2014their lack of communication\u2014with plans. Essentially, they have no negotiating power, and they are sort of told what they have to do, and if they can take it or leave it\u2026[I]t\u2019s not an outlier; it\u2019s common.\u201d Senator Collins also criticized the lack of price transparency, which contributes to the high cost of prescription drugs. \u201cOne of the issues that really troubles me is the lack of transparency in the system. The [Maximum Allowable Cost] price is not what most people pay,\u201d   \u201cPrices vary depending on what pharmaceutical benefit manager negotiated. Prices vary according to, obviously, whether a generic can be substituted. There's just a lack of transparency in the entire system.\u201d In November 2015, Senators Collins and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), the Chairman and former Ranking Member of the Senate Aging Committee, launched the first-ever bipartisan investigation into the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to egregious price spikes for certain generic, off-patent drugs. Following their investigation, Senators Collins and McCaskill introduced legislation to improve generic competition and lower the cost of prescription drugs. This bill was signed into law in August as part of the FDA Reauthorization Act. Lori Reilly, the Executive Vice President of Policy, Research & Mentorship at PhRMA, thanked the Senator for her work to reduce drug prices. She also expressed support for increasing price transparency. \u201cIf we're going to have a discussion on transparency, which we would welcome, we think it is important to have one that holistically involves entire supply chain,\u201d   \u201c[T]here are costs, as I mentioned before, in the hospital sector alone where they are increasing their reimbursement two and a half times over what they acquire a pharmaceutical product for. We definitely need to have more transparency into areas like that.\u201d Witnesses testifying at today\u2019s hearing included: \u2022 Lori M.

This bipartisan legislation, authored by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bill Nelson (D-FL), would provide states with the flexibility and support that they need to create state-based reinsurance programs for their individual health insurance markets.

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cMeet the Press Daily\u201d October 17, 2017 TODD: Joining me now is the Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins, who is a member of the Senate HELP Committee, whose leaders of course crafted this deal. Senator Collins, good to see you. COLLINS: Thank you. TODD: Alright, let me get your initial reaction to this deal. I know you still got the details to look at, but from what you\u2019ve heard, what you\u2019ve read, what you\u2019ve seen, are you inclined to find a way to support this deal? COLLINS: Absolutely. I'm very pleased that Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray continue to work so hard to try to stabilize the insurance markets, to lower premiums, and to provide some stability, which is really needed. This bill may not be perfect. I would have liked to have seen a specific authorization and some seed money for reinsurance pools, which would further help to lower premiums. But this is a good package, and I hope it will be passed very quickly so it can have an impact on rates this year. TODD: Would you call this a deal that saves Obamacare for now or chips away at it? COLLINS: I wouldn't characterize it either way. I would say that it's an agreement that prevents low-income people from losing access to funding, to subsidies that help them support their out-of-pocket costs. It's a deal that helps to ensure that insurers do not flee the market leaving no choices or fewer choices for consumers. And it gives far more flexibility than exists under the Affordable Care Act for states to do more experimentation and innovation. TODD: Some of these innovations, though, that allow for, you know, waiving certain federal rules on insurance\u2014on what insurance you can offer\u2014are you convinced this will fully protect those folks with the preexisting conditions? That the catastrophic plans and all those things, that it isn't going to put them in a riskier pool by themselves? COLLINS: I am. I am convinced that it is going to protect people with preexisting conditions or I would not support it. The interstate pacts are really already authorized under existing law. I don't really think they are going to make a lot of difference because the states are going to have to come together and agree on a common set of rules and guidelines and consumer protections. That is already current law, but it's just never been implemented. There's much more flexibility given in the waivers, but it's really process flexibility. The waivers have to be approved much more quickly. You don't have to have budget neutrality in a single year, which is very difficult to do when you are innovating. TODD: Senator Lamar Alexander has been around the block. He's not somebody that's new to politics. Let me ask you this, would he have gone public saying we had an agreement with Patty Murray if he didn't have the White House on board? COLLINS: He definitely has been talking to the president, and I believe that the White House will be on board. TODD: You say \u201cwill be.\u201d You think they already are essentially with this framework? COLLINS: I do. TODD: So anything being said to the contrary is just negotiating posturing at this point? COLLINS: Likely, or there may just be confusion within the White House. That's not unheard of in this White House. But from what I understand, the president has been involved personally. He's encouraged this bipartisan agreement, and my goal is for us to pass it as rapidly as possible because those rates are being set and open season is coming up very soon. TODD: You know, President Trump also said that he has the votes, essentially, for Graham-Cassidy in the Senate, that the votes are there for block grant style reform. Is that true? I\u2019m assuming if the votes were there, wouldn't you be voting on it? COLLINS: Well, I don't see it, but of course people keep tinkering with the bill. There have been four iterations to date, and I\u2019m sure that the authors, who are very committed to this approach, continue to work. But when you realize that virtually every health care provider group from physicians, to hospitals, to insurers, to disease advocacy groups are opposed to that approach I just don't see us getting there. TODD: Before I let you go, do you feel that the U.S. Senate, as an institution, is under attack by the president? COLLINS: The president has made very clear that he's not happy with the Senate. I hope that the meeting that he had with Mitch McConnell this week will lead to a new era where we work together and there's more consultation, more harmony, fewer tweets and fewer texts. TODD: What's your confidence level in Mitch McConnell as your leader right now? COLLINS: Very high. TODD: You have no issues with him? What do you make of the Steven Bannon attempts to try to create an atmosphere that would chase him out of his leadership position? COLLINS: I think what Steve Bannon is trying to do is completely inappropriate and also inconceivable to me. He's not looking at how people vote on issues that matter to President Trump. He's looking at whether or not they support Mitch McConnell as majority leader. Mitch McConnell is key to President Trump's ability to get tax reform through, for example. So I don't understand Mr. Bannon's approach. Obviously, he has the right to say or do whatever he wants. But I certainly don't think that it is at all constructive. TODD: Senator Susan Collins, I will leave it there. Republican from Maine, good to see you. COLLINS: Thank you. TODD: We\u2019ll have you back for another couple of years at least. COLLINS: Thank you."},
{"title": "ICYMI: Senator Collins Interviewed on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d", "date": ["Posted Wed, 10/18/2017 - 10:17"], "release": "\u00a0This morning, U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a member of the Senate Health Committee, was interviewed by Chris Cuomo on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cNew Day\u201d October 18, 2017 CUOMO: Joining us now is Republican Senator Susan Collins. I wish I did not have to discuss what is going on between the president, a congresswoman, and the family of a slain soldier right now, Senator, but the president made it relevant. What is your take on this ongoing situation about how the president handled this loss of life? COLLINS: First of all, I don't know what was said on the conversation. I have to believe that any president, as commander-in-chief, must feel incredible anguish, pain, and compassion when there are the deaths of the troops that he has been responsible for making the policy decision to send them into action. My heart goes out to the families of the four green berets who were killed in Niger, as well as all of those service members whose lives have been lost in combat over the past decade. CUOMO: Look, obviously a big part of respecting the loss of these men and their families is to get answers. Let\u2019s not forget, that's how this started. The president made the handling of the loss of life an issue in response to questions about why he ignored this ambush. What do we know, Senator? What do you think has to be discovered, and soon, about why this loss of life occurred? COLLINS: The Department of Defense has begun an investigation, and that is really needed in this case. The fact that these soldiers were ambushed\u2014and that we didn't know it was coming\u2014indicates deficiencies or failures in two areas, at least. One is intelligence that we had, and second is whether or not they were given support enough to make sure they could respond instead of being caught up in a firefight. So this deserves a thorough investigation, and it\u2019s my understanding that investigation is under way at the Pentagon. CUOMO: Especially where this young man, David Johnson, is involved, if it's true that his body was left behind for over a day, what was it about? Why did this happen? This is the largest loss of life on President Trump's watch involving an aggressive force killing American troops. So, we are going to stay on it and we are going to stay on the part that matters most because that's how we respect the sacrifice of these men by getting answers on how they lose their lives. Let me ask you about another issue of great import to American families: This health care bill, are you okay with the Alexander-Murray compromise? Getting the cost sharing revenues back basically in the same form, there\u2019s some changes to what President Trump took out is being put back. But this flexibility that is given to states. Flexibility is a defined term, Senator, and it could mean something for states like yours. COLLINS: I believe that the two senators have negotiated an excellent package. It\u2019s bipartisan. It will help stabilize the markets. It would prevent premiums from going up by on average 20 percent, which would be extremely harmful, and it would ensure that more insurers don't flee the marketplace, thus providing fewer or even no choices for consumers. Those are very important provisions. As far as flexibility, the bill is very careful to maintain protection for people with preexisting conditions, like asthma, or arthritis, or diabetes, or cancer. I strongly support the package because otherwise we will see chaos in the markets, and we are also going to see low-income people having difficulty in affording their out-of-pocket costs. CUOMO: Right, I want to separate the two moves on this because they have different motivations. Most of what you are saying that this bill will protect against, it's protecting against what the president just made possible by cutting the revenues in the first place. Had he not done that, you wouldn\u2019t need this bill to fix it. And I get that there is an ancillary argument about whose role it is to put in those kinds of things and it\u2019s the subject of litigation that\u2019s stalled right now. So that's one component. The flexibility and the change in that language, Senator, are there any concerns about what that will mean for states and their ability to carve out types of coverage, to create pools that may be good for the young and healthy but not good for the infirm? COLLINS: The bill has been very carefully drafted to prevent those kinds of adverse consequences. I would contrast that with the proposal that was put forth by Senators Graham and Cassidy that would\u2019ve allowed states to abandon some of those important consumer protections. But the bill that has been crafted by Senators Alexander and Murray keeps the essential health benefits in place, it gives more flexibility for states on how to meet those benefits, and also in the design of insurance by allowing there to be a so-called copper plan that nowadays is only available for people up to age 29, and would be substantially cheaper. It would still cover those benefits, but it would have a higher deductible. That would be attractive and help expand the pool, and that's really what insurance is all about. We\u2019ve got to expand the pool if we are going to keep premiums down. CUOMO: It\u2019s one of the things that I guess was not fully understand by people, that the strong do have to give in order so that the weak and the sick can get the coverage they need. And I know that makes people uncomfortable, especially when they are young and healthy or don\u2019t need that kind of coverage but that\u2019s kind of the deal insurance has always been. We\u2019ll see if that stays the same. Now the big question, will you get a vote on this? COLLINS: Well that is the big question, indeed. Yesterday, I would have told you absolutely. It seemed to me everything was going very well, that the president, despite in some ways precipitating the crisis, had come onboard with this bipartisan approach, but now the White House is sending conflicting messages -- CUOMO: How so? COLLINS: They now are saying that they are not quite sure they like it or whether it's necessary. No one should buy into the rhetoric that somehow this is a bailout for the big insurance companies. It is not. This money goes to people to help offset the out-of-pocket costs for people who make between 100 percent of the poverty level and 250 percent of the poverty level. So, it\u2019s some of our most vulnerable citizens. And it\u2019s really disturbing to hear it mischaracterized. Now that some opposition seems to be arising, I\u2019m not sure what's going to happen, but I really think that we have a duty to act and to act quickly so that we can have an impact before open season starts, which is going to in just a few weeks. CUOMO: If that period remains abbreviated as the president wants to do, you have even less time. What is your hint of what McConnell wants to do? COLLINS: I am not sure. Leader McConnell gave ample opportunity for Lamar Alexander to present his plan to the caucus yesterday, but he did not follow-up by a full throated endorsement of it. So, I\u2019m not sure what his plan is. I am certainly encouraging him to bring the bill to the floor, and if it comes to the floor, I think the votes are there. I can't speak for the House. And the votes, I believe, will be there in both bodies if the president reiterates his support for this short-term proposal. It does not solve all the problems with the ACA by any means, but it would give us more time to work on a series of bills to correct the flaws in the law. CUOMO: Very interesting politics going on here with McConnell and the president, and it will be interesting to see what the Senate Leader does in this situation. Senator Collins, thank you for allowing us to vet what's in this bill and why you think it\u2019s the right move for the American people. We will check back with you when the next step is taken. COLLINS: Thank you, Chris."},

VitaminSea harvests seaweed from Maine sources and creates health products from the seaweed, including animal food, nutritional supplements, plant fertilizers, and skin care products. The company plans to use the grant to explore the market potential of kelp as a nutritional supplement and natural preservative. The commercialization of kelp has the potential to positively impact fishing and harvesting communities across Maine.

However, there is a lack of understanding and services to support seniors with disabilities and their caregivers, who are often aging themselves. October is National Disability Employment Awareness Month. Today, Senator Susan Collins, Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, led a hearing that examined the unique challenges of people with IDD as they age. Titled, \u201cWorking and Aging with Disabilities: From School to Retirement,\u201d the hearing focused on the transition of disabled older Americans from school to employment and into retirement. In addition, the hearing explored how transportation difficulties can serve as a barrier for people with disabilities.\u00a0 Through vocational training, employment, education, medical, and social support, individuals with disabilities can thrive in adulthood. \u201cStudies show that employing individuals with disabilities is not simply a social good -- it is also good business,\u201d   \u201cIndividuals with disabilities offer many advantages including a highly motivated workforce, lower rates of absenteeism and employer turnover, greater loyalty, and higher rates of satisfaction and productivity among the entire workforce. \u00a0 \u201cEric Meyer, the CEO of Spurwink, provided valuable testimony to the Committee about how his organization provides education, job training, and other skills to promote confidence and independence among children and adults with disabilities,\u201d  \u201cBy providing these resources, Spurwink\u2019s dedicated staff and volunteers have helped individuals with disabilities reach their goals, stay engaged in their communities, and build a bright future.\u201d In his testimony to the Aging Committee, Eric Meyer, President and CEO of Spurwink, described the importance of providing individuals with IDD and their families the support they need. Spurwink is one of Maine\u2019s largest providers of behavioral health that serves 8,300 people, and employs 930 people throughout the state.\u00a0 Focusing on Spurwink\u2019s client philosophy he said, \u201cOur person-centered planning model is driven by the client and their family - creating individualized goals, planning with their team where they\u2019ll live, the type of work to pursue - all informing the supports our team will provide to help them meet their goals. It is not about Spurwink doing something to or for our clients \u2013 it is about Spurwink supporting clients to meet these goals.\u201d The aging population in the United States has the highest rate of disability.

In the letter, the Senators voice their support for an affirmative decision in an ongoing antidumping/countervailing duty (AD/CVD) case against Chinese hardwood plywood companies that are benefiting from unfair subsidies from the Chinese Government enabling them to sell \u2013 or \u201cdump\u201d \u2013 their products in the United States at less than market value. \u201cFor many small towns in America, the hardwood plywood industry is the largest source of employment,\u201d\u00a0   \u00a0\u201cWhen facilities are closed by unfair trade, communities are severely harmed.\u00a0 Moreover, Chinese companies in the wood products sector---including hardwood plywood manufacturers\u2014are the world\u2019s largest consumers of illegally sourced wood material.\u00a0 Chinese producers benefit from subsidies and from illegal logging, creating a playing field that tilts in their favor and against hard-working American manufacturers, costing American jobs.\u201d The Coalition for the Fair Trade of Hardwood Plywood represents six American businesses and includes Columbia Forest Products, a hardwood plywood manufacturer which employs more than 160 people at a facility in Presque Isle. The Coalition\u2019s petition is currently under review by both the Department of Commerce and the ITC. Both the DOC and ITC have preliminarily found in favor of the Coalition, and if each body makes a final determination in favor of the Coalition, the DOC will issue an antidumping/countervailing duty order that would instruct U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to\u00a0impose final duties on\u00a0each of the companies that has been found to engage in unfair practices. The Senators\u2019 letter was sent in advance of the ITC\u2019s final\u00a0hearing\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0case today. In 2013, the ITC ruled against a similar petition from the American hardwood plywood industry against Chinese companies. Since that time, imports of Chinese hardwood plywood have increased by 40 percent, with imports valued at $1.12 billion in 2016. By comparison, the American hardwood plywood industry is currently operating at less than 50 percent production capacity.

During the prior case, U.S. hardwood plywood manufacturers were operating at no more than 50 percent of their production capacity. Since then, that number has decreased further. This is because, as the Commission found in its preliminary investigation, increasing Chinese imports undersell American-made products by substantial margins. For many small towns in America, the hardwood plywood industry is the largest source of employment. When facilities are closed by unfair trade, communities are severely harmed.\u00a0 Moreover, Chinese companies in the wood products sector\u2014including hardwood plywood manufacturers\u2014are the world\u2019s largest consumers of illegally sourced wood material.\u00a0 Chinese producers benefit from subsidies and from illegal logging, creating a playing field that tilts in their favor and against hard-working American manufacturers, costing American jobs. We appreciate the Commission\u2019s work to date on this important matter, and urge the Commission to ensure U.S. trade remedy laws are fully\u00a0enforced."},

The letter follows an announcement this week from the DOI that it is\u00a0proposing to increase fees at 17 highly-visited national parks \u2013 including Acadia National Park \u2013 during peak seasons to help offset the backlog. The proposal would nearly triple the cost of park passes for private vehicles at Acadia from $25 a pass to $70 a pass. In their letter, Senators Collins and King highlight alternative solutions to fix the issue, like leveraging excess mineral revenues to create a National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund or establishing a Conservation Service Corps that would engage veterans\u2019 organizations and young people with volunteer-driven conservation projects on federal lands. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c365 days a year, Acadia National Park\u2014one of the crown jewels of the National Park System\u2014serves as a tremendous resource for the people of Maine and the visitors who come here,\u201d  . \u201cFrom May through October, it sustains a vibrant economy in the region, bringing millions of visitors across the country and the world to the coast of Maine. Like most other parks, Acadia has felt the strain of the maintenance backlog, in part due to this sustained visitation. While we recognize that this proposal would bring additional revenue to the park, we are not certain that this would either solve the problem or outweigh the risk to the local community of making the park more difficult to visit. \u201cAccording to the National Park Service, these fee increases are expected to raise $70 million annually. Given the scale of the maintenance backlog, at almost $12 billion, it is difficult to see how this represents a long-term solution to the problem, especially while the National Park Service in its 2018 budget request proposes to cut its own operations budget by $200 million and its maintenance funding by $93 million. We should keep in mind that the American people already pay for the maintenance of the National Park System through their tax dollars; if we are going to ask them directly for a greater contribution to the parks, it should be commensurate with service or more clearly justified than this proposal.\u201d Senators Collins and King, who are members of the Appropriations Committee and Energy and Natural Resources Committee respectively, have supported a number of bipartisan initiatives that would address the maintenance backlog in the National Park System. They are both cosponsors of the , which would take excess mineral revenues to create a National Park Service Legacy Restoration Fund starting at $50 million annually and rising to $500 million by 2027. The monies from the fund would be directed to high-priority deferred maintenance needs. Additionally, in the 2016 Energy Policy Modernization Act, Senator King secured a provision that establishes the National Park Service Maintenance and Revitalization Conservation Fund which allocates $150 million annually from offshore leases towards high priority deferred maintenance needs. He is also a cosponsor of the   which would establish a service corps to help address many of the maintenance projects. The maintenance backlog, which accounts for annually deferred maintenance for the National Park System\u2019s 75,000 plus constructed assets, had reached nearly $12 billion at the beginning of 2017. The full letter is below and can be read  . +++ October 26, 2017 The Honorable Ryan Zinke Secretary U.S. Department of Interior 1849 C Street, NW Washington, D.C. 20240 Dear Secretary Zinke: We write to express our serious concern for the National Park Service\u2019s proposal to raise the cost of entrance passes at Acadia National Park in Maine and sixteen other highly-visited National Parks. The stated justification for the increases\u2014the chronic maintenance backlog at our National Parks\u2014is a worthy cause, yet this proposal both fails to adequately address that challenge while also raising the possibility of an obvious but unintended consequence: a decrease in attendance at our National Parks. We believe an immediate increase of this magnitude to the fees at Acadia, such as the increase for private vehicles from a $25 pass to a $70 pass, poses a risk to the growing visitation at Acadia. 365 days a year, Acadia National Park\u2014one of the crown jewels of the National Park System\u2014serves as a tremendous resource for the people of Maine and the visitors who come here. From May through October, it sustains a vibrant economy in the region, bringing millions of visitors across the country and the world to the coast of Maine. Like most other parks, Acadia has felt the strain of the maintenance backlog, in part due to this sustained visitation. While we recognize that this proposal would bring additional revenue to the park, we are not certain that this would either solve the problem or outweigh the risk to the local community of making the park more difficult to visit. According to the National Park Service, these fee increases are expected to raise $70 million annually. Given the scale of the maintenance backlog, at almost $12 billion, it is difficult to see how this represents a long-term solution to the problem, especially while the National Park Service in its 2018 budget request proposes to cut its own operations budget by $200 million and its maintenance funding by $93 million. We should keep in mind that the American people already pay for the maintenance of the National Park System through their tax dollars; if we are going to ask them directly for a greater contribution to the parks, it should be commensurate with service or more clearly justified than this proposal. We do believe, however, that in many cases money is being left on the table. To address that, we have advocated for the National Park Service to update its operations, to embrace technology and to be more creative. Only recently has the Park Service updated the cost of the lifetime Senior Pass from $10 to $80, for example. We have also pushed the Park Service to enable online and mobile pass sales to make purchasing passes more visitor friendly. We also believe the Park Service can and should target more revenue from commercial uses and visitation. In order to address the scale of the problem with the maintenance backlog, though, we need to think bigger. There have been a number of bipartisan proposals here in the Senate to address the backlog including S. 751, the National Park Service Legacy Act sponsored by Senators Warner and Portman, which would offer a dedicated revenue source to address the problem from mineral revenues. S.1460, the similarly bipartisan Energy and Natural Resources Act, contains provisions for a similar revenue source. Finally, our colleague Senator McCain has also proposed S.1403, the 21  Century Conservation Service Corps Act, which could help address many of these maintenance projects by expanding the contributions of volunteer service members. As we celebrated the Centennial of the National Park Service last year, we were reminded that these parks are monuments to our nation\u2019s heritage. They are indeed America\u2019s best idea. Without question, if we want to ensure that future generations are able to enjoy them as we have been able to we must properly care for them. We urge you to work with us and with Congress to adequately do so. But before taking the action of raising fees to this degree, we strongly urge you to consider all available options and to consider the full breadth of the impact of this action on Acadia and the other parks. We look forward to working with you on this matter."},

Senator, given that experience and the interviews and work you\u2019ve done on that committee, how do you process this news about sealed indictments from the special counsel? COLLINS: From the very beginning, this investigation has gone along two tracks: One is the independent counsel's investigation to see if there is criminal wrongdoing. And it looks like we're going to find out as early as tomorrow about some indictments in that area. The other has been the Intelligence Committee\u2019s evaluation of the extent of Russian meddling in the last election and to try to\u2014along with the independent counsel\u2014answer the question of whether or not there was any collusion between members of President Trump\u2019s campaign team and the Russians. We are having a very interesting hearing this week looking at the Russians\u2019 use of social media to influence the elections and to sow the seeds of dissension in our country. DICKERSON: Any sign of collusion after all these interviews, all this time? COLLINS: I have not yet seen any definitive evidence of collusion. I've seen lots of evidence that the Russians were very active in trying to influence the election. DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the so-called dossier, which is information that was gathered of all kinds about candidate Trump. The   reported this week that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee donated\u2014paid for\u2014part of its creation. John Podesta, the Clinton Campaign Manager, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz came before the Senate Intelligence Committee and said, \u201cWe don't know who paid for this.\u201d Well, that was before this   report. Sitting next to Podesta was the lawyer from the Clinton campaign who paid for the report. So, these guys need to come back and sit down and tell the committee what is up? COLLINS: They absolutely need to be recalled. It's difficult to imagine that a campaign chairman, that the head of the DNC, would not know of an expenditure of this magnitude and significance. But perhaps there\u2019s something more going on here. But certainly, it's worth additional questioning of those two witnesses. DICKERSON: And what about the lawyer? COLLINS: And the lawyer. Absolutely. In fact, he more than anyone. DICKERSON: Let's go now to the criticisms from Senator Corker and Senator Flake this week. Senator Flake, in particular said\u2014had a message for his Republican colleagues\u2014and he said, basically, don't be complicit. What did you make of that message? COLLINS: First, let me say that Jeff Flake is one of my best friends in the Senate. I have enormous respect for him. And I\u2019m really sorry that he's not going to be running for re-election. The Senate will be a lesser place without his being in it. Having said that, I think we need to accept that Donald Trump is our president. And my approach is to work with my fellow Republicans, with Democrats, with House members and also with this administration. That is the only way that we're going to get things done in this Congress. It's the only way that we can assure the American people that they can have some trust in government. And that we're working to better their lives. DICKERSON: Senator Flake would say that there is some responsibility, though, even while you're trying to get things done to call out those things that the president does that might get in the way of you getting things done. COLLINS: Absolutely. And I have not hesitated to disagree with the president, whether it's with his comments after the incidents in Charlottesville or on the very important health care issues. So I'm going to continue to do that. I'll work with the president and support his policies when I think he's right. But I will not hesitate to oppose him when I think that he is misguided. DICKERSON: The next big issue with which you have disagreement or total agreement with the president is tax cuts. What are you looking for in this that concerns you or that you'd like to make sure is in this package? COLLINS: Three major principles will guide my evaluation of tax cuts, which I do think we need: First, I want the tax code to be simpler, fairer, and more pro-growth. That's really important. We can really lift standards of living for working families in this country. We can help small businesses create jobs. We can have a beneficial impact on the economy as a whole if we do tax reform right. So far, I\u2019m encouraged by the discussions that I\u2019ve had with the members of the Senate Finance Committee, and I\u2019m hopeful that we can put together a package that will attract some Democratic support, too. DICKERSON: What about the deficit effects of this, though? You in the past have asked for\u2014you\u2019ve been against some tax cuts because of the effect on the deficit.\u00a0 In this case a lot of people are calling alarms. COLLINS: That's why it's important that this tax reform package be pro-growth. And if you look at the Congressional Budget Office analysis, if we have just four tenths of one percent increase in our GDP, which is entirely realistic, it will cover the cost of the tax reform package. DICKERSON: Final question I want to ask you: Congresswoman Jackie Speier came forward, she had been a House staffer, and she talked about the sexual assault that she experienced 40 years ago and she says that this kind of misconduct is still rampant on Capitol Hill. You were a staffer once.\u00a0 What was your reaction to this? COLLINS: I have not witnessed that. But that doesn't mean that it isn't occurring. I think we're seeing that there is sexual harassment and even assault in virtually [all] workplaces across the country. That's something that certainly all of us need to work on, but it's not something that I personally experienced. DICKERSON: Senator Collins, thanks for being with us. COLLINS: Thank you."},

Funding and \u2018Right-to-Try\u2019 Drug Bills\u201d", "date": ["Posted Fri, 08/04/2017 - 10:29"], "release": "By: Robert Pear and Sheila Kaplan Click   to read the full article online. An excerpt as well as the full story are also pasted below. \u201cThe food and drug agency depends on user fees to speed the approval of drugs while maintaining strict standards of drug safety. \u201c\u2018User fees, where companies fund a portion of the premarket review of their products, account for more than a quarter of all F.D.A. funding, yet the F.D.A.\u2019s authority to collect these fees will expire at the end of next month unless Congress acts. That\u2019s the urgency of getting this bill across the finish line,\u2019 said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. \u201cAs chairwoman of the Senate Aging Committee,  The Senate on Thursday gave final approval to legislation to finance the Food and Drug Administration, clearing the measure for President Trump and tapping drug manufacturers once again to help pay for the federal review of prescription drugs and medical devices. The 94-to-1 vote came just hours after the Senate passed a separate bill expanding access to experimental treatments for people with terminal illnesses. This bill, the Right to Try Act, will now go to the House, where more than three dozen lawmakers have endorsed similar legislation. Mr. Trump is expected to sign the bill reauthorizing user fees to pay for the agency to review medical devices, brand-name drugs, generic drugs and biosimilars, which are copycat versions of costly biologic drugs made from living organisms. The House approved the user fee bill by voice vote on July 12. The vote capped an often frustrating seven months for Republicans, who hoped to churn out reams of conservative legislation with their control of both chambers and the White House. Since the dramatic failure of the Senate\u2019s health care repeal bill last week, lawmakers have seemed resigned to more incremental successes. \u201cWe\u2019re passing critical legislation. We\u2019re confirming nominees to important positions,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said from the Senate floor on Thursday, citing a series of veterans\u2019 bills and the confirmation this week of a new F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray. \u201cWe\u2019re taking steps in the right direction.\u201d Yet, even on their final day in session, lawmakers were reminded of the often uncomfortable marriage between Mr. Trump and the Republican-led Congress. Mr. Trump lashed out over a bill \u2014 which he signed grudgingly this week \u2014 to sanction Russia for meddling in last year\u2019s presidential election and for its aggression toward its neighbors. The legislation also limits Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to lift or suspend the sanctions himself. The measure, which the administration sought to block as it moved through the Capitol in recent weeks, is among the most significant accomplishments of this Congress. Some senators are also maneuvering in response to the White House\u2019s criticisms of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into ties between people in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit and Russia. On Thursday, Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, and Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, introduced legislation that would allow for judicial review if a special counsel was removed. The F.D.A. bill, which passed overwhelmingly in both houses, was a struggle, taking lawmakers more than a year to forge a consensus among Republicans, Democrats, F.D.A. officials and drug and device companies. \u201cThis is a bill that\u2019s been done the right way,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate health committee, in a subtle dig at Republican leaders who bypassed the committee and Democrats on their failed push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of the way the Senate is supposed to work.\u201d Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the committee, said, \u201cThis is really a great example of how Congress can actually work together on health issues and solve challenges.\u201d The food and drug agency depends on user fees to speed the approval of drugs while maintaining strict standards of drug safety. \u201cUser fees, where companies fund a portion of the premarket review of their products, account for more than a quarter of all F.D.A. funding, yet the F.D.A.\u2019s authority to collect these fees will expire at the end of next month unless Congress acts. That\u2019s the urgency of getting this bill across the finish line,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. The bill includes a proposal by Ms. Collins intended to prevent huge, unjustified cost increases on decades-old prescription medicines that have no competition. The legislation directs the agency to speed the review of generic drug applications when products on the market have little or no competition. As chairwoman of the Senate Aging Committee, Ms. Collins conducted a yearlong investigation that found \u201cegregious price spikes for certain off-patent drugs for which there were no generic competitors.\u201d The \u201cright-to-try bill,\u201d introduced by Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, aims to establish a new pathway for terminally ill patients to gain access to experimental drugs that have not been approved by the F.D.A. These patients are often extremely ill and unable to participate in clinical trials, or have no other treatment options. Under current law, drug companies can already provide access to patients outside of clinical trials under a program known as expanded access or compassionate use. The F.D.A. already approves about 99 percent of compassionate use requests. But companies sometimes refuse, fearing that the results could be used against them by the F.D.A. In some cases, drug makers fear they could be sued by patients who say they have been injured by unapproved drug products. The bill would establish national standards and rules to help channel drugs still under development to terminally ill patients. It also would shield pharmaceutical companies and doctors from some of the legal risks of providing drugs that have not been approved by the agency. Companies that manufacture such drugs and doctors who prescribe them would generally be protected unless they engaged in \u201creckless or willful misconduct\u201d or \u201cgross negligence,\u201d or intentionally harmed a patient. \u201cThese are real people facing their mortality with no hope,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThis right-to-try piece of legislation will give those individuals and families hope.\u201d Lawmakers and right-to-try advocates often say that terminally ill patients have nothing to lose. But those who oppose the bill say there is a difference between dying comfortably and dying horribly, suffering pain and other side effects of an unapproved drug. Patients seeking access to unapproved drugs often contact members of Congress and their aides, who in most cases do not have the medical background to determine whether a treatment is safe and effective."},

A transcript of the interview follows: JACKSON: Republican senator Susan Collins of Maine may have some, as well, for the president. She\u2019s joining us exclusively now. Senator, thank you for being with us here. COLLINS: Well, welcome to Bangor, Maine. JACKSON: I want to talk about what\u2019s going on in Washington, but I have to start with the news of the day, which is what is happening in Afghanistan. You have watched this war play out for 16 years. Are you confident that the president can execute some kind of a successful strategy, if it means increasing the number of troops on the ground? COLLINS: Well, we need to hear the strategy that the president is going to present tonight. I will say two things. And that is that in the past 16 years, our efforts in Afghanistan, which have cost the lives of so many troops, have lacked focus. There hasn't been a strategy. Second, we need a strategy that is going to deal with the influence of countries like Pakistan, like Iran, like Russia. JACKSON: So, if the president decides to stay the course, as he may do, is that enough for you? COLLINS: I\u2019m worried about that, because if you look at a map of Afghanistan, the Taliban has made enormous gains in the last couple of years. I don't want Afghanistan to be a safe haven for terrorist attacks the way that it was prior to the attacks on our country on 9/11. But this is a very difficult issue. And I\u2019m glad that there's been a detailed analysis of what to do. That\u2019s what we needed. JACKSON: I know you will be watching that address tonight as well as people across Maine. It will likely be in the front page tomorrow. What was in the front page today, I want to show you of the Bangor Daily News, and that is the protests over the weekend. Charlottesville and the aftermath of what happened there have been driving a lot of the conversation, and in the wake of that, your republican colleague, Senator Corker questioned President Trump's competency. Senator Tim Scott said the president had compromised his moral authority. What do you say about the president's response? COLLINS: The president had an obligation, a moral obligation to speak with absolute clarity from the very beginning. And stick with that to denounce the neo-Nazis, the white supremacists, the anti-Semitism that we heard, and unfortunately he wavered back and forth. There are no good neo-Nazis. JACKSON: What does that say to you about his leadership? COLLINS: In this case, I think the president failed to meet the standard that we would have expected a president to do in a time like that. There should be no place for hatred, bigotry and racism in this country. And he should have said that very clearly. He did at times, but then he wavered back and forth. JACKSON: Given your concerns about that, senator, at what point, though, given what we heard from your republican colleagues, does that talk turn into action? At what point, if any, do you not support his re-nomination? COLLINS: Well, I didn't support the president when he was our party's nominee. That was a very difficult position for me to take. I\u2019d never taken it before. Instead, I wrote in the name of Paul Ryan. And that was very hard to me to do as a lifelong republican. JACKSON: So what happens, he is already running for re-election, what is happening next? COLLINS: It is too early to tell now. There is a long ways between now and that point. JACKSON: Do you think he will end up the party's nominee in 2020? COLLINS: It\u2019s too difficult to say. JACKSON: Let me ask you about health care, because hat is something that was critical to the president on the campaign. You were one of the pivotal no votes on that. Let me ask you this, since there is still talk about this coming back up in the fall, is repeal and replace dead altogether? COLLINS: Repeal without a replacement that is workable, that doesn't hurt vulnerable people, and destroy the ability to a health care in rural America, I hope it's behind us. That does not mean that our job is done. There are serious problems with the Affordable Care Act. High premiums, the insurers fleeing the markets, so that even if you have a subsidy there is no policy that you can buy. And we're starting hearings in the Senate Health Committee in September to address those issues. JACKSON: So, to help stabilize the individual markets. Is that enough? Is that going to be the accomplishment you can point to when we talk on the December break? COLLINS: It\u2019s not enough. But it's an essential first step. I see a series of bills, where we address many of the problems that are associated with the ACA. JACKSON: You have been trying to work to lower prescription drug pricing, for example, which is an example for a lot of folks here in Maine. Is that an area where you see bipartisan consensus? COLLINS: I really hope so. I am so offended by an investigation that I conducted with Claire McCaskill last year on the Aging Committee, where we found that companies were buying these drugs from which the patent had expired and literally overnight hiking the cost of medicine by as much as 5,000%. We need to have a more competitive marketplace where generics are more readily available. And we're working with the FDA commissioner to do just that. JACKSON: Two more very quick questions for you. Are you satisfied with Senator McConnell\u2019s leadership on not just health care but and his response to President Trump and the way he's conducting his business? COLLINS: I don't always agree with Senator McConnell, but I think he has been a good and effective leader. JACKSON: You continue to back him as the leader of the Senate? COLLINS: I do. JACKSON: Opioid issues are, obviously, crucial here in Maine. If funding does come through for more prevention and help with people who are struggling with addiction, where does that go? COLLINS: We need a three-prong approach, and we need to focus on prevention education and focus on treatment, and we need to focus on enforcement, we need to do all three. The most painful statistic in Maine is 1,000 babies were born last year to addicted mothers. JACKSON: It\u2019s a powerful statistic and one that is hard to hear. Before I let you go, there is obviously a lot of political discussion about your role, your future here in Maine. Are you going to run for governor? COLLINS: I have not made a decision. On the one hand, a lot of seniority in the Senate, I\u2019m 15th and I started out at 99th. And I serve on the Appropriations Committee which has allowed me to do a lot of good for the people of Maine. On the other hand, governor is more hands-on. You can do more to create good jobs. So, I\u2019m weighing where I can do the most good for the people of Maine. JACKSON: Does the person in the White House affect your decision all? Does the fact that it's President Trump, who you would be working with as a senator, who you clearly have disagreements with, play in with your decision? COLLINS: No, not really. I want to evaluate where I can do the best for the people of Maine and I\u2019m taking in a lot of advice from people. JACKSON: Senator Collins I hope if and when you make that decision, you'll come back and share it with us. I appreciate you being here with us from Bangor, Maine, a place that you know well."},

The legislation also establishes a new $50 million youth inpatient addiction treatment grant program to fund facilities that provide substance use disorder treatment services to underserved, at-risk Medicaid beneficiaries who are younger than age 21, with an emphasis on rural communities.\u00a0 In addition, the bill would increase flexibility for pregnant and postpartum women who are seeking treatment, and would allow them to access the services they need to ensure positive birth outcomes.\u00a0 This legislation builds off a letter that Sens.

Senators Collins and Shaheen have consistently worked to increase funding for diabetes research and promote better health care for people with diabetes. Insulin-dependent Medicare beneficiaries rely on therapies such as patch pumps, which provide continuous insulin delivery without the need for tubes, to help manage their disease. While such treatments are covered by private insurance, Medicare does not cover these devices. As a result, individuals with diabetes may lose coverage for the physician-prescribed therapies they have been successfully using to manage their diabetes when they age into Medicare. \u201cEffective management of diabetes is crucial to holding down health care costs and helping seniors manage their diabetes successfully to allow them to continue to live healthy and productive lives,\u201d   \u201cWe urge your careful review of Medicare coverage policies for patch pumps and other life-saving therapies for diabetes, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and to review the procedures at CMS that have resulted in these disparities in coverage.\u201d Diabetes affects nearly 30 million Americans nationwide, and it has been estimated that the number of Americans living with this disease will double and the related health care costs will nearly triple by 2035.

The hearing was the first in a four-part series on short-term insurance market stabilization. Senator Collins has consistently championed a bipartisan process to begin fixing the flaws in the Affordable Care Act so that it will work better for all Americans. State insurance commissioners have extensive hands-on experience and practical insight that will be invaluable to the Committee as it works to develop commonsense policies to improve the health insurance market. Senator Collins served as the commissioner of the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, which oversaw the Maine Bureau of Insurance, from 1987-1992. Senator Collins told Julie Mix McPeak, the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, about Maine\u2019s success at lowering premiums through a resinsurance program that ended when the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges opened. She asked Ms. McPeak about the feasibility of the federal government providing technical and financial assistance to help states replicate Maine\u2019s achievement. \u201cWe heard today of the success of the reinsurance pool that Alaska set up. Similarly, Maine between 2012 and 2013 had a reinsurance pool that was successful in lowering rates in the individual market by 20 percent on average,\u201d   \u201cSo I think when you look at the experience of those two states alone it shows the benefit of reinsurance pools.\u201d \u201cI do believe that the reinsurance mechanism or a high-risk pool, either one, has the effect of removing from the risk pool the highest cost claims, which provide certainty to insurers and helps them actually price products for those other individuals in the risk pool so it should bring premiums down remarkably,\u201d  During the hearing,   \u201cOne of the keys to driving down rates in the individual market is to broaden the market and to get as many people as we can enrolled.\u201d Senator Collins asked Lori Wing-Heier, the Director of the Alaska Division of Insurance, to comment on whether allowing more people to purchase low-cost \u201ccopper\u201d health plans would help expand insurance coverage. \u201cWe believe that being able to have a catastrophic or copper plan available for a younger population is beneficial to growing the market and getting the healthier individuals in,\u201d   \u201cWe also think that it should probably be combined with a Health Savings Account.\u201d Senator Collins agreed that combining these low-cost health insurance plans with Health Savings Accounts would be a great way to help consumers pay for out-of-pocket costs.

Those of us old enough to remember each have our own recollections of where we were and what we were doing as the horrifying attacks began to unfold. We share the still-powerful emotions of shock, anger, and grief. \u201cOn the evening of that terrible day, members of Congress gathered on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. With tears in our eyes and sorrow in our hearts, together we sang, \u2018God Bless America.\u2019 The emotions of shock, anger, and grief were joined by unity and resolve. \u201cToday, that moment remains my most enduring memory. The sense of unity, resolve, and patriotism that swept over us as we sang was a source of strength in the challenges we faced. \u201cIn Maine, we remember Robert and Jackie Norton of Lubec, a devoted retired couple who boarded Flight 11 to celebrate a son\u2019s wedding on the West Coast. We remember James Roux of Portland, an Army veteran and a devoted father, on Flight 175 for a business meeting in California. We remember Robert Schlegel of Gray who was celebrating his recent promotion to the rank of Commander in the United States Navy, and still settling into his new office at the Pentagon, an office that is believed to be the point of impact for Flight 77. We remember Stephen Ward of Gorham, who was working on the 101st floor of the North Tower that terrible morning. \u201cOn this solemn anniversary, we join all Americans in remembering each of the nearly 3,000 lives lost that day \u2013 lives of accomplishment, contribution, and promise. Each loss leaves a wound in the hearts of families and friends that can never be fully healed. \u201cAnd we honor the heroes of that day. We still are moved by the selfless courage of men and women on Flight 93 who wrestled that plane to the ground, sacrificing their lives so that others might live. We are inspired by the firefighters and police officers at the World Trade Center who continued to climb upward in rescue even as the Twin Towers were coming down. We pay tribute to the first responders, the military personnel, and the civilians who rushed into the smoke and flames at the Pentagon to lead others to safety. We express our gratitude to those who have given so much to defend our nation against terrorism, the men and women of our armed forces. \u201cSeptember 11th was not just a day of personal tragedy. It was an attack on the United States, an attack on freedom, an attack on civilization. We must never forget what was lost and what remains at stake. We must pledge to do all that we can to prevent future attacks. The fundamental obligation of government is to protect its people. Since September 11th, we have done much to meet that obligation. \u201cIn what seemed like a moment, September 11th was transformed from a day like any other into one that, forever, will stand alone. The loss we relive reminds us of the value of all that we must protect. The heroism reminds us of the unconquerable spirit of the American people. Our accomplishments remind us that we can meet any challenge with decisive action. As long as we keep the meaning of this day of remembrance in our hearts, we will meet the challenges that lie ahead.\u201d"},

The Navy uses long-term TDY assignments at shipyards to perform critical ship maintenance and repair work. In 2014, however, the DoD implemented a new policy that reimburses shipyard workers conducting off-yard maintenance at a reduced flat rate per diem rate rather than the full per diem rate. This reduced reimbursement jeopardizes the ability of public naval shipyards, including PNSY, to effectively and efficiently conduct Navy ship maintenance, modernization, and repair.

While President Trump\u2019s FY 2018 budget blueprint proposed cutting LIHEAP entirely, Senators Collins and Reed led the effort to secure $3.39 billion - level with FY 2017 - for LIHEAP in the FY18 Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Labor-H) Appropriations Bill. \u201cAccess to affordable home energy is a matter of health and safety for many low-income households, children, and seniors in Maine. The LIHEAP program remains an important lifeline that helps prevent people from having to make the impossible choice between paying for heat and paying for other necessities like food or medicine,\u201d   \u201cIt is critical that Department of Health and Human Services release these funds promptly so that our most vulnerable citizens have the resources to stay warm and healthy this winter.\u201d \u201cAs winter approaches, now is the critical moment to ensure low-income families and elderly citizens can keep warm during the season\u2019s low temperatures,\u201d Senator King said. \u201cNo one should have to choose between food, medicine, or a warm home, which is why LIHEAP is such an important source of assistance to nearly 50,000 people in Maine. There\u2019s no time for the Department of Health and Human Services to waste \u2013 we need to ensure funding from this program is disbursed quickly.\u201d In addition to Collins, Reed, and King, the letter was signed by Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Edward Markey (D-MA), John Hoeven (R-ND), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Gary Peters (D-MI), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Robert Casey (D-PA), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Al Franken (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Jon Tester (D-MT), Patty Murray (D-WA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernard Sanders (I-VT), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), and Ben Cardin (D-MD). According to statistics from the Administration for Children and Families, an estimated 6 million households receive assistance with heating costs through LIHEAP, and all 50 states, the District of Columbia, five U.S. territories, and over 150 tribes and tribal organizations receive LIHEAP grants each year.

The hearing featured testimony from two health care experts and two emergency response strategists on lessons learned from past experiences and what more can be done to ensure the health, safety, and resilience of older Americans during and after disasters, such as hurricanes. \u201cAs these recent disasters make clear, older Americans are particularly vulnerable before, during, and even after a storm,\u201d   \u201cWhile we have made strides since Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago, we must ask ourselves: can we better protect the most vulnerable members of our communities? What gaps exist that could jeopardize lives in the next catastrophe, whether it\u2019s a storm, earthquake or some other unanticipated event? We should not have to wait for the next Irene, Sandy, Harvey, Irma, or unnamed catastrophe to strike.\u201d Senator Collins is the former Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Following Hurricane Katrina, along with then-Senator Joe Lieberman (I/D-CT), she chaired a series of hearings and issued a report on the weaknesses in our nation\u2019s emergency response, including the failure on the part of all levels of government to plan and provide for the timely and effective evacuation of our most vulnerable seniors. One of yesterday's witnesses, Dr. Karen DeSalvo, former Health Commissioner in New Orleans, credited Senator Collins for her work post-Hurricane Katrina that led to the development of a National Disaster Recovery Framework to clearly define coordination structures and roles and responsibilities, and to much improved communication between local, state, and federal emergency personnel. During the hearing, Dr. Kathryn Hyer, professor and director of the Florida Policy Exchange Center on Aging at the University of South Florida, showed that in some cases, it is potentially more dangerous to evacuate nursing home residents from a hurricane than to shelter in place. While each case is different and depends on the situation, she suggested broad steps that could make nursing homes and assisted living facilities safer, especially if disaster strikes. Dr. Hyer called for making emergency plans more accessible to family members, increasing oversight of assisted living facilities, and prioritizing nursing homes for restoration after the storm. Senators Collins, Bill Nelson (D-FL), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Bob Casey (D-PA) introduced legislation, the Protecting Seniors During Disasters Act, that would create a national advisory committee dedicated to improving preparations and care for our nation\u2019s seniors during a disaster. \u2022 Karen DeSalvo, M.D., M.P.H., Former Health Commissioner, City of New Orleans, LA \u2022 Kathryn Hyer, Ph.D., M.P.P., Professor, University of South Florida\u2019s School of Aging Studies, Director, Florida Policy Exchange Center on Aging, Tampa, FL \u2022 Paul Timmons Jr., CEO, President, Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies, Charleston, SC \u2022 Jay Delaney, Fire Chief, Emergency Management Coordinator, Bureau of Fire, Wilkes-Barre, PA"},

In 2014, approximately 2.8 million older Americans were treated in emergency rooms after falling, and more than 800,000 were subsequently hospitalized. Tragically, more than 27,000 of them died as a result of their injuries. The annual total direct medical cost of fall-related injuries for older adults is approximately $34 billion. As more members of the Baby Boomer generation reach retirement age, these costs could nearly double within the next five years. There were 195,000 older adult falls in Maine in 2014 with 35,000 requiring medical treatment or restricting activity for at least one day. The estimated total cost of falls in Maine is $245 million, including $158 million borne by Medicare and $64 million by Medicaid. Seniors can take steps to protect against falls. The University of Maine, in partnership with RSVP Senior Corps, offers Bone Builders, an exercise program that improves balance and reduces falls. Bone Builders is offered in 10 sites throughout Maine including Bangor, Brewer, Deer Isle, Dover-Foxcroft, Ellsworth, Hampden, Newport, Milbridge, Old Town, and Stonington. \u201cFalls-related injuries have a devastating impact on older Americans, their families, and their communities,\u201d   \u201cThis resolution will bring awareness to the impact of this issue, and will also demonstrate some practical initiatives that can be taken to make falls amongst older Americans a far less common occurrence.\u201d \u201cFor older Americans, fear of falling and injuries from falling can significantly impact their quality of life,\u201d   \u201cI am pleased that this resolution calls attention to the importance of prevention and the opportunities for communities to work together to best ensure the health and well-being of older Americans.\u201d This resolution urges relevant federal, state, and local organizations to educate seniors about ways they can reduce the risks that may result from a fall, including injury and even death. It also recognizes that evidence-based programs reduce falls by using cost-effective strategies, such as exercise programs, medication management, vision improvement, reduction of home hazards, and fall prevention education."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cState of the Union\u201d September 24, 2017 TAPPER: Well, Senator Collins joins us now. Senator, good to see you, as always. Your vote is pivotal on the Graham-Cassidy health care bill. Where are you? Yes or no?\u00a0 COLLINS: Jake, it's very difficult for me to envision a scenario where I would end up voting for this bill. I have a number of serious reservations about it. I'm concerned about the impact on the Medicaid program, which has been on the books for more than 50 years and provides health care to our most vulnerable citizens, including disabled children and low-income seniors. I'm concerned about the impact on costs and coverage. We already have a problem under the Affordable Care Act with the cost of premiums and deductibles. And, finally, I'm very concerned about the erosion of protections for people with pre-existing conditions, like asthma, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, and what it would mean to them. TAPPER: I imagine you have been on the phone with other uncommitted senators, like Lisa Murkowski, and also probably with the White House. How have those conversations been going? COLLINS: I have had a lot of conversations over the weekend with numerous of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. And I had a very lengthy conversation with the vice president yesterday. As always, with the vice president, he was very cordial. He made the case. He asked me to think more thoroughly about some issues. I told him about the various analyses of the impact that concern me. He told me he would get me more numbers on the impact on the state of Maine and on the nation. TAPPER: So, you say you find it difficult to have envision any scenario you would vote for Graham-Cassidy. Is that a no, then? COLLINS: What I am doing is, as is my general practice, is, I would like to see the Congressional Budget Office analysis, which is expected to come out tomorrow morning. And I am worried about whether CBO has been given enough time to thoroughly analyze this bill, which has been a moving target. Even over the weekend, I was receiving e-mails suggesting that the sponsors of the bill are still changing the formula. So, it may be difficult for CBO to do the kind of in-depth analysis that it usually does. But that's what I would like to see before making a final decision. But it may be that CBO is going to say that this is impossible because the parameters of the bill keep changing.\u00a0 TAPPER: You say you want to see a CBO score. As you note, there have been other studies of the impact of Graham-Cassidy. Let me put some of the numbers on the screen from some of these studies, 21 million fewer Americans covered. That's from Brookings. States losing $215 billion. That's from Avalere. Thirty-one states losing money. That's from Kaiser. As you know, the CBO score, even if you get it in time for the vote, it's probably only going to look at the impact on the deficit, and not look at the impact on the issues you talk about, Medicaid, the total number of uninsured. What information could the CBO possibly provide you that might make you support the Graham-Cassidy bill? COLLINS: Well, I actually expect that CBO is either going to reinforce those studies that you have just mentioned, all of which I have digested over the past couple of weeks, or that CBO is going to say that they simply don't have the time to do a thorough analysis. But you remember, when the CBO did the analysis of the first Senate bill and the House bill, it was very thorough in analyzing the impact on the number of people who would lose insurance, on the impact of changing the Medicaid program. And, by the way, we would be making these huge changes in Medicaid without the benefit of extensive hearings. And that's what we would need. And so I don't know whether the CBO analysis will have new information that would change where I'm inclined to head. Normally, the way we proceed is to look at the CBO analysis. I'm going to know tomorrow morning whether or not CBO reinforces the concerns and reservations that I already have based on the studies that you have cited, or whether CBO is going to say that they can't come up with the kind of in-depth analysis that the agency usually does, or maybe there will be a surprise in there. I don't anticipate that. But I want to wait. It's just a few more hours to wait to see that important study. TAPPER: So, it sounds like a no, with an asterisk unless CBO has some sort of dramatic change. President Trump had some tough words on Friday for any Republican senator who votes the way it looks like you're likely to vote. He tweeted -- quote -- \"Rand Paul or whoever votes against health care bill will forever, future political campaigns, be known as 'the Republican who saved Obamacare.'\" Assuming that you ultimately vote the way it sounds like you're going to vote, are you OK with President Trump calling you the Republican who saved Obamacare? COLLINS: You know, my focus is on improving our health care system. And what I would like to see happen is for us to return to the very good work that the Senate Health Committee was doing, under the leadership of Senators Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray. We had four substantiative, in-depth hearings, widespread participation by the Senate, during the past two weeks. And they were very close to producing an initial bill that would help to moderate increases in premiums, or actually lower premiums, and stabilize the insurance markets to ensure that people had more choices. That's the avenue that we should take. The ACA is a flawed law. And the cost of premiums and deductibles are a real problem for individuals, particularly those who don't get subsidies. And it's a real problem for our small businesses. \u00a0So, I want to fix those problems. And I see the work we're doing in the Health Committee as the path forward. I think we should do a series of bills, with the first bill being directed at stabilizing the markets and lowering premiums. TAPPER: Senator Susan Collins from the great state of Maine, thank you so much. We appreciate your time today."},

She joins us this morning from Bangor, Maine. Senator, you're waiting to hear from the Congressional Budget Office for it to give you its assessment of this bill. What is it that you're most worried about? COLLINS: I really have three major concerns. One is the impact on the Medicaid program. This is a very important program in my state and many others because it provides needed health care to low-income seniors, to disabled children, and to so many of our most vulnerable citizens. Some of the projections are that $1 trillion would be taken out of the Medicaid program between the year 2020 and 2036. That would have a devastating impact, and the changes, the sweeping changes have not been thoroughly analyzed by Congress. \u00a0Second, I'm really concerned about continued coverage and protection for people with preexisting conditions like asthma or diabetes or arthritis or cancer. This bill clearly weakens those protections, so it depends on where you live. And you would still be sold insurance, but it might well be unaffordable. And finally, I'm very concerned both with the current law and with the proposed law about the impact on premium costs and on the number of people who will be covered.\u00a0 DICKERSON: So Senator, that's a really long list. Is there anything, really...given your experience and your knowledge of health care, and the rush to get this done before next week, it just doesn't seem possible with your long list that your fears can be allayed by anything CBO is going to put out. COLLINS: Well, it is hard for me to envision getting to yes on this bill, because my concerns are so fundamental. CBO's analysis in the past has been very helpful to me in evaluating bills such as the previous bills that I opposed. And that's why I'd like to see it. \u00a0The problem is, CBO may have a very difficult time analyzing the bill because it still seems to be a moving target, even over the weekend. The sponsors were making changes in it, and I think that's part of the problem. You can't, when we're dealing with a sixth of our economy and millions of people, you can't do sound health insurance policy this way. You need to have extensive hearings. The Democrats must come to the table. And that's what we should be doing.\u00a0 DICKERSON: There's one hearing scheduled for Monday, so in your view that's not enough?\u00a0 COLLINS: That isn't even close to enough. You know, the Medicaid program has been on the books for more than 50 years. The Graham-Cassidy bill proposes a dramatic sweeping change in the way that program would be allocated and administered. And a program, which does need reform, but we need careful reform. And I don't think this bill does that. DICKERSON: Your Republican colleagues say on the record and off that this might lose them control of the Senate. What do you think of that? If this doesn't pass? COLLINS: I don't think that's the case. What Americans want is more affordable health care. And throughout this entire debate, it is so ironic that when the ACA was being passed years ago and as we're deliberating today, that there is not enough focus on looking at the causes of escalating health care costs. \u00a0And that includes taking a look at the rising costs of pharmaceutical drugs. And that is something that we need to do way more focus on that. I think that the Senate Health Committee's done a great job having four substantive hearings. We ought to proceed down that route and do a series of bills that fixes the current law, which does have a lot of flaws.\u00a0 DICKERSON: Let me ask you one last question. If this fails in the Senate and the current law stays in place, the Affordable Care Act, what obligation does Health and Human Services have, the Department of Health and Human Services have to support the Affordable Care Act during the open enrollment period that we have coming up?\u00a0 COLLINS: The department has to follow the current law. I hope that we can pass a bill this week that will be bipartisan, help stabilize the markets, help reduce the premiums under the leaderships of Senator Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray and those of us who are working hard toward that goal. But the administration does need to follow the current law until we change it. DICKERSON: All right, Senator. Thanks so much for being with us. And we'll be right back in a moment with more \"Face the Nation.\" ###"},

{"title": "Senator Collins Opposes Graham-Cassidy Health Care Bills", "date": ["Posted Mon, 09/25/2017 - 17:11"], "release": "\u00a0U.S. Senator Susan Collins announced today that she opposes both versions of the health care bill sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy. The Senator\u2019s statement follows: \u201cHealth care is a deeply personal, complex issue that affects every single one of us and one-sixth of the American economy. Sweeping reforms to our health care system and to Medicaid can\u2019t be done well in a compressed time frame, especially when the actual bill is a moving target. Today, we find out that there is now a fourth version of the Graham-Cassidy proposal, which is as deeply flawed as the previous iterations. The fact that a new version of this bill was released the very week we are supposed to vote compounds the problem. \u201cI have three major concerns with both the proposal that we were discussing last week and the newest version that was put together this weekend: \u201cFirst, both proposals make sweeping changes and cuts in the Medicaid program. Expert projections show that more than $1 trillion would be taken out of the Medicaid program between the years 2020 and 2036. This would have a devastating impact to a program that has been on the books for 50 years and provides health care to our most vulnerable citizens, including disabled children and low-income seniors. \u201cSecond, both bills open the door for states to weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions, such as asthma, cancer, heart disease, arthritis, and diabetes. Some states could allow higher premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions, potentially making their insurance unaffordable. States could also limit specific categories of benefits for Affordable Care Act policies, such as eliminating coverage for mental health or substance abuse treatment. \u201cThird, physicians, patient advocates, insurers, and hospitals agree that both versions of this legislation would lead to higher premiums and reduced coverage for tens of millions of Americans. \u201cThe CBO\u2019s analysis on the earlier version of the bill, incomplete though it is due to time constraints, confirms that this bill will have a substantially negative impact on the number of people covered by insurance. \u201cThere has been some discussion that the new version of the bill includes additional money for my home state of Maine. The fact is, Maine still loses money under whichever version of the Graham-Cassidy bill we consider because the bills use what could be described as a \u201cgive with one hand, take with the other\u201d distribution model. Huge Medicaid cuts down the road more than offset any short-term influx of money. But even more important, if Senators can adjust a funding formula over a weekend to help a single state, they could just as easily adjust that formula in the future to hurt that state. This is simply not the way that we should be approaching an important and complex issue that must be handled thoughtfully and fairly for all Americans. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has many flaws that need to be addressed. The current state of health insurance, where premiums are skyrocketing, choices are limited, and small businesses are struggling, needs fixing. My focus will remain on remedying these problems.\u201d"},

According to testimony before the Senate Aging Committee today, the FTC says it received more than 3.4 million robocall complaints last year. This year, that number has already passed 3.5 million. Although the \u201cDo Not Call\u201d Registry has been in existence for 14 years and is supposed to help prevent unwanted calls, far too many Americans are frustrated by these unwanted calls. As part of their continued effort to crack down on illegal robocalls and con artists who harass and steal from older Americans, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bob Casey (D-PA), Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Aging Committee, held a hearing today titled, \u201cStill Ringing Off the Hook: An Update on Efforts to Combat Robocalls,\u201d to examine efforts of law enforcement and the telecommunications industry to crack down on unwanted calls. According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), there are nearly 2.4 billion robocalls made every month. \u201cLast year, Americans received an estimated 2.4 billion unwanted calls each and every month -- that\u2019s about 250 calls a year for every household in the country. In previous hearings on this topic, we learned that changes in technology have made it possible for scammers operating overseas to use automated dialing \u2013 or robocalls \u2013 to reach victims in the U.S,\u201d   \u201cJust as technology has enabled these frauds, it can also be used to fight back. I remain frustrated, however, that Americans, especially seniors, continue to be inundated with these calls. I am hopeful that continued education, more aggressive law enforcement, and an increased focus on advances in technology, will ultimately put an end to these harassing calls.\u201d \u201cIt has been nearly eight months since the FCC first proposed a rule that would make it harder for scammers to spoof certain telephone numbers to trick people into answering their phones and creating opportunities for fraud and scams,\u201d   \u201cToday, I call on the FCC to finalize this rule immediately, so that we can uphold our sacred responsibility to do more to safeguard older adults from frauds and scams.\u201d While the advent of new telecommunication technologies has increased efficiency and reduced costs, scammers have also capitalized on these advancements to operate with much greater ease. A simple Internet connection and software program can put an overseas scammer in business to begin attempting to rip off older Americans. But just as technology has enabled these frauds, it can also be used to thwart scammers. In 2016, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) convened the \u201cRobocall Strike Force,\u201d an industry-led group aimed at accelerating the development of new tools to halt the proliferation of illegal and unwanted robocalls and allowing consumers to control which calls they receive. The Strike Force has made significant progress toward arming consumers with call blocking tools and identifying ways voice providers can proactively block illegal robocalls before they ever reach the consumer\u2019s phone. Genie Barton, President of the Better Business Bureau Institute for Marketplace Trust (BBBI), testified at today\u2019s hearing about her organization\u2019s work to track and report scams, and provide education to older Americans. Working with local and state agencies to create a more trustworthy marketplace, she elaborated on the total damage of scams to businesses and consumers saying, \u201cthere is no greater threat to consumers and legitimate businesses than the fraud perpetrated by con artists,\u201d adding that, \u201cIt not only robs both consumers and legitimate businesses, but it does far more harm. It humiliates the individual scam victim. It damages the reputation of ethical businesses whose identities scammers assume. Finally, scams erode consumer trust and engagement in the marketplace.\u201d One of the most common scams reported to the Aging Committee\u2019s Fraud Hotline is the IRS Impersonation Scam. According to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, more than 10,000 Americans have been defrauded through this scam at a cost of an estimated $54 million. Witnesses at today\u2019s hearing, including Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, expressed concern with a recent change in federal law that allows private debt collectors, contracting with the IRS, to call Americans who owe back taxes. They emphasized that the IRS will never threaten anyone who may owe the IRS, and the agency will never ask taxpayers to pay using pre-paid iTunes or similar debit cards. Anyone who receives a suspicious call from someone claiming to be with the IRS should call the Committee\u2019s Fraud Hotline at 1-855-303-9470. Click   to read their testimonies."},

Senator Collins, thank you for joining us this morning.\u00a0 You also announced this week you're sticking around. You\u2019re going to stay in the Senate rather than run for governor. One of the reasons you said is that you want to fight hyperpartisanship.\u00a0 You want some bipartisan solutions. I take it one of them is what Leader Pelosi was just talking about, that bipartisan bill in the Senate right now to try to fix what is wrong with Obamacare. COLLINS: That\u2019s absolutely right. I\u2019m a member of the Senate Health Committee, which has been doing really important work to try to stabilize the insurance markets, to ensure that premiums go down and that people are going to have access to health insurance. That effort has been led by the bipartisan leaders of Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray. We have all had input; there were four great hearings. And I hope we can proceed, but Democrats are going to have to step up to the plate and assist us. It\u2019s a two-way street. STEPHANOPOULOS: But how about the president? It doesn't seem to have the support of the president right now. COLLINS: Well, I\u2019m very disappointed in the president's actions of this past week. The debate in Washington has been whether or not to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the future. What the president is doing is affecting people's access and the cost of health care right now, and I don't agree with his decision on the subsidies that help low-income people afford their deductibles and co-pays, and I don\u2019t agree with his executive order. But Congress needs to step in, and I hope that the president will take a look at what we're doing. STEPHANOPOULOS: The president also pushing very hard for tax reform.\u00a0 The first step in that will be Senate passing a budget. I know you hope to do that this week. Are you a yes on that budget? COLLINS: I am likely a yes on that budget. I very much want to see tax reform. As you know, George, we haven't had an overhaul of the tax code since 1986. I don't think there's a single American who thinks that the tax code is fair or simple or helps promote job creation, and that should be our goals. STEPHANOPOULOS: The question is what kind of tax reform will the Senate end up voting on.\u00a0 Some of your colleagues have pointed out their concerns. Rand Paul says he can't support a bill that increases taxes on the middle class. Bob Corker says he can't support a bill that increases the deficit. What are your conditions? COLLINS: Well, I\u2019m not saying that this is going to be easy, but I want to see us help our working families with tax relief, and doubling the standard deduction does just that. I want to see us help our small businesses, and I want to see us pursue policies that will encourage our larger corporations to create jobs in this country, not overseas. Those are some of my goals, and I think we can get there. There's bipartisan support for reforming the tax code, and I hope we can keep it a bipartisan effort. STEPHANOPOULOS: I just mentioned Bob Corker. He created quite a stir this week with his comments about President Trump, including this to the  . CORKER: He doesn't realize that, you know, that we could be heading toward World War III with the kind of comments that he's making. STEPHANOPOULOS: He also said that the majority of his Republican colleagues in the Senate agree with his concerns about the president's volatility. Are you one of them? COLLINS: Well, I have a lot of respect for Bob Corker. He\u2019s been a good friend and an excellent senator. I don't think that the Twitter war between him and the president is very productive, and I think the president needs to learn that his words really matter, that what he could say when he was in the private sector is entirely different. Every comment that the president makes, even if it's an offhand comment like the one he made about the \u201ccalm before the storm,\u201d is scrutinized by both our enemies and our allies. So, the president needs to be more careful in his language. But, I think that we all need to get back to work on the issues. STEPHANOPOULOS: During the campaign, you wrote that the president's lack of self-restraint was creating the possibility for a more perilous world. Has that come to pass? COLLINS: The president's comments at times have not been helpful in promoting stability and reassuring our allies. But he is the president, and I understand that, and as I said, I hope that he'll be more careful with his words in the future. STEPHANOPOULOS: The president's former strategist, Steve Bannon, was also out this week declaring war on the GOP establishment. Let's listen: BANNON: And let me give a warning to you: Nobody can run and hide on this one. These folks are coming for you. The day of taking a few nice conservative votes and hiding is over. And right now, it's a season of war against a GOP establishment. STEPHANOPOULOS: Says he's going to oppose every GOP incumbent up in 2018 unless they say they're not going to vote for Mitch McConnell as Senate leader. Meantime, the president is gonna be meeting with Mr. McConnell tomorrow. Are they working at cross-purposes? And what\u2019s your response to Steve Bannon? COLLINS: They are working at cross-purposes. This is not helpful or appropriate at all. Obviously, Mr. Bannon has the right to support whomever he wants to support. But I think his rhetoric is exactly what the American people are tired of. They don't want this hyperpartisanship. They want us to work together, and they want us to get things done. They want us to work across the aisle. They want us to work with the president. And Mr. Bannon's over-the-top rhetoric is not helpful. Mitch McConnell is the Senate Majority Leader. The president needs him. I\u2019m glad that they're working together on tax reform and a lot of other issues, and I\u2019m glad that they're meeting this week. Mr. Bannon's comments are not helpful in that regard. STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, Ambassador Nikki Haley is up next to talk Iran. Do you support the president's decision to decertify the Iran deal? COLLINS: It\u2019s important to distinguish between what the president did and what he didn\u2019t do.\u00a0 He could have reimposed sanctions unilaterally. He could have withdrawn from the agreement. He chose not to do that. Instead, he put a spotlight on two very troubling deficiencies in the agreement. Deficiencies which caused not only me, but also the Democratic Leader, Chuck Schumer, to vote against the agreement. And those deficiencies include the fact that there are no limitations on Iran\u2019s ability to develop ballistic missiles, including an intercontinental ballistic missile which could reach us. We need to remember that a nuclear weapon is not just the warhead, it\u2019s the means of delivery as well. Second, he outlined a very important point, ant that is that under the agreement, Iran has what I call a \u201cpatient pathway\u201d to developing a nuclear weapon. So we ought to try to fix that. That\u2019s what I hope that Congress will do, and I hope that the president will consult more fully with our allies since this is a multilateral, not a bilateral agreement. STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Collins, thanks for your time this morning."},

The SAVE Act would facilitate information sharing with states, provide guidelines for how best to secure election systems, and allow states to access funds to develop their own solutions to the threats posed to elections. In order to ensure states can respond in real time to any potential issues or threats, the SAVE Act would require the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to sponsor security clearances to the officials responsible for the administration and certification of federal elections in each state, usually the secretaries of state. The DNI would then share all appropriate classified information with those state officials to protect election systems from security threats.

{"title": "Supporting America\u2019s Military Caregivers", "date": ["Posted Fri, 06/16/2017 - 12:58"], "release": "The effects of military service often do not end with a tour of duty. For some veterans and their families, the journey may extend for a lifetime. For those veterans bearing both the visible and invisible scars of conflict, the transition home is often not easy. Recovery, too, can take decades. Along the way, mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and other family members and friends step in to serve. Military caregivers, heroes in plain clothes, are serving in American cities and towns every single day. In the United States, there are 5.5 million military caregivers. These family members and loved ones provide care on a constant and routine basis to veterans. They are often vital in assisting veterans to make the transition all the way home. Military caregivers improve recovery, rehabilitation, and reintegration of wounded, injured, and disabled veterans. The number of military caregivers has been on the rise as veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan return home. Approximately 20 percent of military caregivers today are caring for a post-9/11 veteran. The needs and experiences of post-9/11 veterans differ from those of pre-9/11 veterans. While veterans from past conflicts and wars are aging and facing age-related conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and cardiovascular diseases, post-9/11 veterans tend to be younger and face higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, substance abuse, and traumatic brain injury. As chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I recently held a hearing to examine the unique needs of military caregivers and how to better support them. Those needs were powerfully described by one of our witnesses from Maine, Melanie Swoboda. Melanie and her husband, retired Army Sergeant First Class Joe Swoboda, live in Levant, near Bangor. Joe is a three-time combat veteran of Iraq who twice sustained severe injuries in explosions, in 2003 and 2005, but who continued to serve. It was not until years later that the extent of his traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder were recognized. Melanie lovingly took on the role as one of America\u2019s hidden heroes, providing her husband\u2019s care, raising their children, and managing the family\u2019s finances. As she put it, \u201cAll of the tasks I was doing were the ones you\u2019ll hear any caregiver talking about.\u201d In fact, like so many caregivers, Melanie never thought of herself as one. To her, that\u2019s just what a wife and mother does. She enrolled in the VA Caregiver Program, which provides a stipend and respite support for post-9/11 veterans, which she said has been crucial for her family. She urged my Senate colleagues to support legislation I introduced with Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), the  , which would extend this service to veterans and caregivers of all eras. Melanie also praised the Dole Caregiver Fellowship, a network of knowledgeable caregivers who provide invaluable support. This outstanding initiative was launched by another witness, former Senator Elizabeth Dole, whose husband, former Senator Bob Dole, is a World War II veteran. When her husband was hospitalized at Walter Reed in 2011, Senator Dole became friends with families caring for many wounded, ill, or injured veterans. Many of these young spouses were in their 20\u2019s and early 30\u2019s. Realizing they had a lifetime of caregiving in front of them, and understanding the critical role caregivers play in helping our wounded warriors recover, she established the Elizabeth Dole Foundation to raise awareness of the importance of supporting these selfless individuals. The Foundation\u2019s \u201cHidden Heroes\u201d campaign is leading the way in developing solutions to this major challenge. Our military caregivers, like all caregivers, make many personal and financial sacrifices to ensure that their loved ones have the care they need. They may have to miss work, turn down promotions, or even leave the workforce, creating enormous financial strain for families. In addition to the  , I have introduced bipartisan legislation that would better serve caregivers, including military caregivers. The  would require the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a national strategy to recognize and support our more than 40 million family caregivers. And the   would authorize $15 million per year over the next five years to allow full-time caregivers to take a temporary break from their responsibilities. This respite care is critical. It protects the health of caregivers, decreases the need for professional long-term care, and allows individuals who require care to remain at home. America\u2019s military caregivers enable veterans living with visible and invisible injuries to recover, remain involved with their communities, and enjoy fuller lives. Despite their sacrifice, military caregivers typically do not receive awards and other recognitions for the work that they do. They deserve our support and recognition. We must never forget our military caregivers, who are also true heroes."},

The complete text of the letter can be read   and is below: +++ June 19, 2017 The Honorable Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. United States Secretary of Commerce 1401 Constitution Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20230 Dear Secretary Ross: We write to express our interest in the treatment of fishing privileges associated with the groundfish permits currently held by Mr. Carlos Rafael following the conclusion of the case,  . Mr. Rafael has plead guilty in federal proceedings to 28 criminal counts of conspiracy, false labeling and fish identification, falsifying federal records, tax evasion, and bulk cash smuggling. As part of his plea, Mr. Rafael will forfeit 13 fishing vessels and the associated groundfish permits. Under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, it is our understanding that Mr. Rafael\u2019s actions would justify permanent revocation and redistribution of any permits remanded back to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) as part of the Department of Justice\u2019s criminal case. Mr. Rafael\u2019s grave and extensive disregard for both the law and sustainable fishing practices is a setback to the recovery of the beleaguered Northeast multispecies (groundfish) fishery, and has done, and will continue to do, financial harm to fishermen from Maine to New York.

For these reasons, we believe the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) should cancel each of the groundfish permits that Mr. Rafael currently holds and reallocate the fishing privileges associated with such permits to all eligible permit holders in the fleet. While this is an unprecedented situation, existing regulations (50 CFR 648.87) clearly establish this treatment of canceled permits. We are specifically troubled that the City of New Bedford (where Mr. Rafael\u2019s enterprise is based) is seeking to acquire control of his permits. We believe, instead, that all members of the fleet, including those in New Bedford, who have been disadvantaged by Mr. Rafael\u2019s illegal activity, deserve a share of the rights to access these permits once remanded back to NMFS. Unlike other assets that are seized and liquidated in criminal proceedings and are distinct in their economic utility, these groundfish permits embody a shared resource and, as such, should be returned to groundfish fishermen in a fair and uniform manner.

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cMorning Joe\u201d June 9, 2017 SCARBOROUGH: With us now, a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine. BRZEZINSKI: Great State of Maine. I love Mainers. COLLINS: You have good taste. BRZEZINSKI: I know. They don't hold back. COLLINS: That\u2019s true. SCARBOROUGH: Every question now is an easy question. Let\u2019s start with John Heilemann. John? HEILEMANN: We've been talking a little bit this morning about the attorney general and what unfolded in the hearing yesterday related to him. Former Director Comey said that they had reason to think that he had to recuse himself way back when. In closed session it's been reported by NBC News that senators learned that there was an undisclosed third meeting between Sessions and the Russians and then yesterday, after that meeting, Senator Manchin, who was just on the show, came out and said, quote, \u201cThere's one meeting we don't know about and people would like to know about it.\" What can you tell us about that? COLLINS: Well, it\u2019s in closed session, of course, I can't tell you much about it, but let me say this: the committee is going to be requesting documents and an interview with the attorney general, and there are some unanswered questions. The attorney general clearly made the right decision in recusing himself from the Russian investigation in light of the report of these meetings, and he made the right call. HEILEMANN: Is it right, though, that there's a third meeting, that that's what you want to get more information about? COLLINS: I truly can't answer that question because of the closed-- BRZEZINSKI: Good try, John Heilemann. SCARBOROUGH: How fascinating, David Ignatius, that yesterday, Comey basically said: because of information I know that I can\u2019t tell you hear, the attorney general had no choice but to recuse himself. IGNATIUS: That was fascinating. He knew something ahead, and I think we\u2019re learning more about what that was. I want to ask Senator Collins, one of the interesting issues that was discussed at yesterday's hearing was the question of taping in the White House. When Comey realized that there might have been tapes, suddenly his view of this and his leverage changed. I want to ask you what is your committee doing or what can be done in the government to establish whether those tapes exist and get ahold of them? COLLINS: We need access to those tapes and the special counsel needs access to those tapes. I have doubts about whether the tapes really exist or whether that was just an attempt by the president to put some pressure on Mr. Comey or to raise some doubts about his testimony. SCARBOROUGH: Shouldn\u2019t the White House tell you whether they have tapes or not instead of playing games with us all and every day. BRZEZINSKI: And pushing Republicans to shill for the White House? COLLINS: We absolutely have a right to know whether there are tapes. This reminds me of the taping system, of course, it reminds all of us that Richard Nixon had and remember that issue went all the way to the Supreme Court, and the president was ordered to turn over the tapes. That precedent has already been established, and we do need to know whether the tapes exists and we do need access to them. But I also can\u2019t imagine that Special Counsel Mueller is not going to want to have access to those tapes if they exist. GEIST: Senator, the president tweeted this morning that James Comey is a leaker. He said, \u201cWow, James Comey is a leaker.\u201d And he\u2019s talking about the testimony that Director Comey gave under your questioning where he said, \u201cI gave this document to a Columbia professor who gave it the New York Times.\u201d At the time he passed that document on, former Director Comey was a private citizen and it was an unclassified document. Is that, as you understand it, a leak per se? COLLINS: I consider that document to be a government work product. After all, it was produced on an FBI computer. It was immediately after his various meetings with the president; he memorialized each of them in a memo, which tells you something about their interactions and how uncomfortable Mr. Comey was. So, I do view it as a government document. When I asked him that question, I did so out of curiosity because there had been so many reports in the press about these memos, and I thought, how did they get there? So I asked him, frankly never dreaming that he would say that I gave it to a Columbia professor with expressed direction for him to get it out in the press in the hopes that it would prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which it did. GEIST: Does it concern you that he passed that document on? COLLINS: I must say that it does. James Comey I believe to be an honorable individual and a person of integrity. He has always railed against leaks\u2014he did yesterday\u2014and so for him to turn out to have leaked a document -- BRZEZINSKI: Was it a leak? COLLINS: I view it that way regardless of his motivation. I think his motivation may have been a good one. BRZEZINSKI: How could you call it a leak? SCARBOROUGH: It was not a classified document, right? COLLINS: It was not a classified document to the best of my knowledge. But if it is a government work product, it belongs to the FBI and not to him as a private citizen. I think a better way would have been to give it to our committee, or to the special counsel, once a special counsel was appointed. But give it to our committee. SCARBOROUGH: Do you find him to be a honest and trustworthy man? Did you believe his testimony yesterday? COLLINS: I do. I found him to be credible, candid, and thorough. Doesn\u2019t mean that every memory he had was exactly right or there aren\u2019t different interpretations, but he testified under oath. BRZEZINSKI: So, I hate to ask you this, but the follow up then would be do you find the president to be an honest and trustworthy man? COLLINS: Well, I put more credence in testimonies that is given under oath, and that is what we got yesterday form Mr. Comey. Now, I think Mr. Comey has made some mistakes. I think he made some mistakes in the handling of the Hillary Clinton case. And I think that he should have told the president when the president made the truly outrageous and unacceptable request that he drop the\u2014or let go the\u2014Michael Flynn investigation. He should have said, \u201cMr. President, I can\u2019t do that, and you shouldn\u2019t be asking me to do that.\u201d BRZEZINSKI: All right. I will take that as an answer. SCARBOROUGH: Susan Collins, Senator Susan Collins, thank you very much for being with us. We really appreciate it. Isn\u2019t it remarkable when you ask a question and you got an answer from James Comey?"},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cNew Day\u201d June 9, 2017 CUOMO: One of the more impressive exchanges, let\u2019s say, during James Comey\u2019s Senate testimony was when he revealed he asked a friend to leak his memos. Take a listen. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0COLLINS: Did you show copies of your memos to anyone outside of the Department of Justice? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0COMEY: Yes. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0COLLINS: And to whom did you show copies? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0COMEY: I asked -- the president tweeted on Friday after I got fired that I better hope there\u2019s not tapes. I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night\u2014because it didn't dawn on me originally\u2014that there might be corroboration for our conversation\u2014there might be a tape\u2014and my judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square. So I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CUOMO: Joining us now is the senator you just saw there, Republican Susan Collins of Maine. Senator, thank you for joining us after that big day. What was your big takeaway from the Comey testimony? COLLINS: Well, there were several. One was that it was clear that the president asked Mr. Comey to do an inappropriate action, and that was to drop the investigation of General Michael Flynn. That was clearly inappropriate. It crossed a boundary that the president should not have crossed. Second, I\u2019m still perplexed as to why Mr. Comey did not say to the president at the time, \u201cMr. President, you can't ask me to do that. That\u2019s not the way our system works.\u201d Or at least in hindsight have a call made from the Justice Department to the White House Counsel talking about what had happened. And third, Mr. Comey's testimony established that he was deeply troubled by his interactions with the president, but that the president was not under investigation as of May 9th when Mr. Comey was fired. CUOMO: Why is that relevant to you, the last part? COLLINS: It\u2019s relevant to me in two ways. One is that our investigation before the Senate Intelligence Committee, it\u2019s a broad investigation into Russian interference in our election last fall about which we have considerable evidence and whether or not either President Trump and/or members of his campaign staff had direct contacts with the Russians that led to collusion or collaboration in this effort. So the fact that the president was not under investigation by no means exonerates his aides. It by no means ends the issue because the special counsel will be continuing the investigation. CUOMO: On the matters that involve dialogue between the president and the former FBI director, whom are you inclined to believe at this point? COLLINS: I found Mr. Comey's testimony to be credible, candid, and thorough. That doesn't mean that he's right in every detail that he's remembering. It doesn't necessarily mean his interpretations are accurate. But he testified under oath, and I do believe that he's an individual of integrity who would not deliberately lie under oath. CUOMO: That would mean that the president is lying to the American people about his efforts to meddle in the Flynn probe. COLLINS: Well, I\u2019m not sure that we can reach definitive conclusions, but I tend to place more credence in testimony that's given under oath. CUOMO: What about your level of concern about what Comey said about Jeff Sessions, his concerns about the legitimacy of the recusal, his concerns about trust in Sessions when he was confronted by the president and what he could do about it to go up the chain as you guys were talking about, and his need to talk to you in a private session about why he thought Sessions would have to recuse himself? COLLINS: First of all, let me say that Jeff Sessions clearly made the right decision to recuse himself, and he did so promptly. But there remain a number of questions about his own interactions with the Russians. We on the Intelligence Committee want to know the answers to those questions, and we have begun to request information from the Attorney General to allow us to get to the bottom of that, and I\u2019m sure the special counsel in his investigation will want to know as well. CUOMO: Two other quick things. COLLINS: I\u2014 CUOMO: Go ahead, Senator, unless you have something to add. COLLINS: I will note that the Attorney General this morning put out a press release disputing what happened, and that's why it is so important that we get to the bottom of it. CUOMO: The word inappropriate keeps being used, and I keep asking whether or not that's a word that will ever carry any accountability. It seems like a word that's used when nothing will really be done about whatever that action is. If it was inappropriate but not illegal, does the president have anything to be concerned about? COLLINS: Well, he does. I think this reflects the fact that this is the first president in our history who has had neither a military nor a political background, and I think he just does not fully understand or appreciate the boundaries and that it is totally wrong\u2014I\u2019ll go beyond inappropriate\u2014it is wrong for the president of the United States to tell or imply to an FBI director that an investigation should not go forward. CUOMO: But how could he not know when he asked the AG and his son-in-law and others to leave, and when they tried to reenter, told them to leave so he could talk to Comey? Doesn\u2019t that tell you everything you needed to know about whether or not the president was being -- acting in ignorance or acting with complete intentionality? COLLINS: Not necessarily, and here's why. The first interaction that the president had with Mr. Comey in early January at Trump Tower, it was the FBI director who cleared the room so that he could have a one-on-one discussion with the president about that salacious dossier. And I wonder if perhaps that made the president think that whenever there is a sensitive conversation to be had with the FBI director that it should be one-on-one because he had two subsequent one-on-one meetings, as well as other phone calls with the FBI director. That doesn't make it right. But ironically perhaps the FBI\u2019s actions in that first meeting send a signal to the president that that is how their interactions should take place. But the point is, by now he certainly should know better. And over several months\u2019 time he should know better. CUOMO: Senator Collins, appreciate your take on this situation, and we enjoyed watching your questioning yesterday. It was helpful to the American people. COLLINS: Thank you very much, Chris. CUOMO: Be well, senator."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d June 9, 2017 HEMMER: Susan Collins, now, out of Maine, was on that committee. She is with me now from Capitol Hill. Senator, good morning to you, and thank you for your time. COLLINS: Good morning HEMMER: You were the one who asked the question about the memos. Did you expect that answer? COLLINS: I must admit that I was stunned by Mr. Comey's answer. The reason I asked the question is there had been press stories about the memos, and I was wondering how those memos got to the press. I had assumed that it might have been a high-ranking FBI official, but I never guessed that it was Mr. Comey himself who had leaked the memo. HEMMER: What do you think now, Senator? COLLINS: I\u2019m surprised. Obviously it had the result that Mr. Comey wanted, which is it prompted the appointment of a special counsel. But I believe that he could have handled it in a different way. He could have given the memos to the Senate Intelligence Committee, he could have come before us or the Judiciary Committee and disclosed their existence and turned them over. But he chose instead a surprising route for someone who, understandably, has railed against others who have disclosed government documents. HEMMER: Given that reaction that you are offering now, how does that change the story, Senator? COLLINS: Well, it's another part of the story. Let me make clear that I think Mr. Comey is an honorable individual with integrity, but he has made some real mistakes in judgment and this would qualify as one of them in my book. HEMMER: If the memos are out there, why did you not see them before this hearing? Would you not be able to frame a better question if you were able to see it for yourself? COLLINS: Absolutely. And we on the Intelligence Committee have requested the memos. We had done so before Mr. Comey came to voluntarily testify before us, and I believe we have the right to see those memos. Certainly -- HEMMER: If that request came before yesterday, did he in fact refuse that request, Senator? COLLINS: The FBI was consulting with the special counsel on access to those memos. So we were waiting to hear back on those negotiations. HEMMER: Is it not government property if he is serving as acting director of the FBI at the time? That should be part of the record, I would assume. Am I right or wrong? COLLINS: I believe you're absolutely right. This isn\u2019t as if Mr. Comey was writing in his private journal at home at night. He produced the memos on FBI computers, in an FBI car, he started writing one. And they are FBI documents and thus government work product. They are not his private papers. HEMMER: There are many in Washington, D.C., including some on our own staff following this story so closely as you well know and they work on Capitol Hill. They believe James Comey has been dragging his feet on this investigation. Do you believe that's the case? COLLINS: No, I really don't. I think he has been aggressive in this investigation. He has taken some steps that I find baffling, such as his failure to confront the president and tell him that his request was inappropriate, that it crossed the line, that it's a boundary a president should not do. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s dragged his feet. HEMMER: Alan Dershowitz has been writing about this all week. He says there\u2019s no plausible case that President Trump obstructed justice. Do you believe that was confirmed yesterday in that testimony? COLLINS: What was confirmed yesterday is as of May 9th when Director Comey was fired, the president was not under investigation by the FBI. That is a valuable fact that we learned yesterday for the first time. That doesn't mean that some of his associates are not under investigation. And it doesn't answer the question of whether or not there was collaboration between the Russians and members of President Trump's campaign team. HEMMER: To be determined in the coming days, weeks, or months or years. COLLINS: Correct. HEMMER: Final question. Where do you believe we are now as millions of Americans are watching on the outside and they want to know what's the direction? Where do you believe that answer is this morning? COLLINS: We're proceeding on two tracks. The special counsel is investigating and looking at whether or not there is any criminal wrongdoing. The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting a broader counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the election. HEMMER: But do we know more today after the testimony yesterday? COLLINS: We definitely do. All we had before the testimony yesterday was speculation. Now we have some facts on the table. Not enough to reach conclusions but we finally are getting facts. And that's what we need for the American people to produce a credible investigation. HEMMER: I hope you come back, Senator. Thank you for your time. Susan Collins, member of the Senate Intelligence Committee with us there from Capitol Hill."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cState of the Union\u201d June 11, 2017 6.11.17 Senator Collins on CNN State of the Union KEILAR: With us now to talk about that, Republican Senator Susan Collins. She is on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Senator, thanks so much for joining us. COLLINS: My pleasure. KEILAR: I want to ask you about something the president has been cagey about, and that is these tapes, of course. So I wonder if you would support issuing a subpoena to the White House. Right now it's just a request coming from Congress. Would you support issuing a subpoena for the recordings or any documents that might come from that? COLLINS: This is an issue that the president should have cleared up in his press conference. He should give a straight yes or no to the question of whether or not the tapes exist, and he should voluntarily turn them over not only to the Senate Intelligence Committee, but to the special counsel. So I don't think a subpoena should be necessary, and I don't understand why the president just doesn't clear this matter up once and for all. KEILAR: If he doesn't, and a subpoena would be necessary to find this out, you support that? COLLINS: I would be fine with issuing a subpoena, but that most likely would come from the special counsel's office. KEILAR: Okay. President Trump, speaking of the special counsel, he said he would 100 percent be willing to testify under oath about his interactions. Do you think that that is something that should go before Robert Mueller, the special counsel, or do you think it should go before Congress or do you think both? COLLINS: The president should fully cooperate with the special counsel and he's indicated that he will do so. We have to keep in mind that the focus of the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation is on the extent of Russian influence on our elections last fall, and whether or not there was collusion, collaboration, cooperation between the Russians and members of President Trump's campaign team. So there are two different investigations with two different emphases under way right now. Both are critical. Both are really important to our country. KEILAR: So it sounds like if he were to talk to -- you would be comfortable with him just talking to Bob Mueller? COLLINS: Yes, I would be. KEILAR: And if he does, should video of that testimony be made public, do you think? COLLINS: Well, that really depends on how the special counsel decides to proceed. It would be unusual if in the midst of the investigation he were to release a video or a transcript of the investigation before the investigation is concluded. That\u2019s frustrating because we all want to know all of the information, but keep in mind that his job is to determine whether or not there are any violations of criminal laws, and he wants to make sure that he has all the evidence put together rather than releasing it in a piecemeal basis. Our committee will release a public report at the end of our investigation, and we're proceeding, and I really commend the two leaders of our committee for what I thought was an excellent series of hearings last week. KEILAR: The bipartisan support backing up what you just said there. The former FBI director said the pressure pressured him to back off from investigating General Michael Flynn. He wrote a note of the interaction with the president at the time he had it saying as much. The president said that never happened. So who do you believe, President Trump or James Comey? COLLINS: I found Director Comey\u2014former Director Comey's\u2014testimony to be candid, to be thorough, and he testified under oath. So I believe that the information that he gave our committee is what he believed happened. That doesn't eliminate the possibility that there was a misinterpretation. What I don't understand is when the president did say to him that he should let go of the Flynn investigation, which was clearly wrong on the president's part, why the director did not say back to the president, \u201cMr. President, that is so inappropriate for to you do that. The independence of the FBI is really important and we cannot be having discussions like this.\u201d I think he should have said that at the time. KEILAR: If it was so inappropriate, then it sounds as if you understand, in the context of what happened, that that was some sort of direction coming from President Trump, so does that make what he said in the Rose Garden this week a lie? COLLINS: Certainly Mr. Comey understood it as a directive. The exact language makes it more ambiguous because he says the president says, \"I hope you can see your way to letting the Flynn matter go.\" That's still wrong for him to do that. Whether it's illegal is a whole \u2018nother issue, and that's up to the independent counsel, but it was wrong of the president to even bring up the subject. KEILAR: If he said to you, Senator, in the White House, if President Trump was talking to you and he said, Senator Collins, I hope you can vote for the health care bill, I mean, how would you interpret that? You would interpret that as a directive, right? COLLINS: Actually, I wouldn't. I think he would be saying truly that he hoped that I would, since he knows I have a lot of reservations about it. KEILAR: Okay. COLLINS: But listen, the conversation should not have occurred. There\u2019s just no doubt about that. KEILAR: So you told CNN on Friday that perhaps it was the inexperience of the president\u2014essentially that's what you said\u2014that maybe he thought all of the meetings with the FBI director should be one-on-one. Is that an excuse for him? I mean, is that just an excuse, or do you think that's really something that is, makes, I don't want to say makes sense, but really could have happened? COLLINS: Let me go back to the first meeting that the FBI director had with President Trump. At that meeting, which had several people in it, the FBI director asked that everyone leave the room except for him -- KEILAR: True. COLLINS: -- And President Trump. KEILAR: I\u2019m running out of time, Senator, so I want to make sure I get this in, because that's a very important point that you make. Then the next meeting is in person, a dinner between the two, which is something that takes lead time. Clearly by this point in time the president should have been aware that this was inappropriate, so how is it possible that this was just him being inexperienced and taking cues from the first meeting if this is something that was set up with considerable advance from the White House. COLLINS: Because my theory is that the president thinks that's how you interact with the FBI director, but someone should have stepped in. The FBI director should have stepped in, the deputy attorney general, the White House Counsel's office, to explain to the president. It's not an excuse. The president clearly does not fully understand or appreciate the boundaries, but he should. I\u2019m not excusing his behavior, but I\u2019m saying that there were a lot of people in government who should have set him straight, and we don't know whether they tried to. KEILAR: Maybe a potential explanation, if not an excuse. We hear you on that. I do want to ask you\u2014 COLLINS: Right. KEILAR: --About health care before I let you go. There\u2019s a quarter million people in your home state, Maine, and they rely on Medicaid. Are you willing to support a health care bill that would result in people losing Medicaid coverage? COLLINS: I am not at all comfortable with the House-passed bill, and indeed I would oppose the House-passed bill. The Senate bill is still a work in progress. We haven't seen the actual language. We\u2019re trying to influence the direction of that, but a bill that results in 23 million people losing coverage is not a bill that I can support. So we'll see what the Senate comes up with. It\u2019s still being drafted. KEILAR: It seems it would be almost impossible for a bill that does not cut some Medicaid to make it through a Republican Senate and a Republican House. Do you think you're being heard on what you're saying about people losing Medicaid? COLLINS: Well certainty the outline of the Senate bill is far superior to the House bill, but we've got a ways to go yet. Now, there are ways to reduce the cost of Medicaid, and you can do that through managed care, such as the Indiana model, and that has produced better health outcomes and lower costs, so there are ways to reduce the cost of Medicaid without throwing people off the rolls. KEILAR: Alright, Senator Collins, thank you so much. Senator Susan Collins of Maine joining us on this Sunday. We appreciate it. COLLINS: Thank you."},

{"title": "Senator Collins Questions Deputy AG Rosenstein at Appropriations Hearing", "date": ["Posted Tue, 06/13/2017 - 11:28"], "release": "\u00a0At a U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing this morning, U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. A transcript of Senator Collins\u2019 Q&A with Mr. Rosenstein follows: COLLINS: Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Rosenstein, I just want to follow up quickly on the two questions that Senator Shaheen asked you about the special counsel. Has the president ever discussed with you the appointment of the special counsel or discussed the special counsel in any way? ROSENSTEIN: No, he has not. COLLINS: And second, if President Trump ordered you to fire the special counsel, what would you do? ROSENSTEIN: Senator, I\u2019m not going to follow any orders unless I believe those are lawful and appropriate orders. Under the regulation, Special Counsel Mueller may be fired only for good cause, and I\u2019m required to put that cause in writing. And so that's what I would do. If there were good cause, I would consider it, if there were not good cause, it wouldn't matter to me what anybody says. COLLINS: Thank you. I want to turn to the opioid crisis, which plagues my state and so many others. Last year drug overdoses were responsible for more than 59,000 deaths in this country, including a record 376 such deaths in Maine. That is 104 more overdose deaths than the year before in my state. So we are not making progress; the situation is actually getting worse despite considerable efforts on the part of so many. Last year, I was briefed in Maine by federal law enforcement officers who told me that they have seen a major influx of drug dealers coming from out of state with direct ties to gangs in major cities, as well as the Mexican drug cartels. For example, in one case, gang members trafficked heroin between New Haven, Connecticut and Bangor, Maine, where I live. They traded drugs for firearms and then distributed those firearms to other gang members upon their return to Connecticut. We obviously need a multi-pronged approach to the heroin and opioid crisis that includes treatment, education and prevention, and law enforcement. And key to that law enforcement leg of that stool is cooperation among federal, state, and local officials. The department\u2019s budget requests $3 million less than Congress appropriated for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act programs for the current fiscal year, and even more troubling to me is there is no funding proposed for the COPS Anti-Heroin Task Force. In my state, this program has helped law enforcement officers seize heroin and prescription opioids and arrest drug dealers. Why is this administration proposing this cut in the CARA funding and eliminating the funding for the COPS Anti-Heroin Task Force? ROSENSTEIN: Senator, I appreciate that question. I think there are a lot of important issues. For me this is actually one of the most important issues that I hope to talk about today. I don\u2019t know if I can give a complete answer in a minute and 35 seconds, but let me tell you, I\u2019ve actually brought with me a chart that I think might be of interest to you. This is a chart of drug overdose deaths in the United States of America. This issue first came to my attention as US attorney in Maryland about three or four years ago, when it was brought to my attention that there had been a significant spike in deaths attributable to opioid drugs in our state, and it has only accelerated since then. But these are frightening numbers, Senator. The final statistics from 2015 reflect about 52,000 Americans lost their lives to drug overdoses that year, and we believe that 2016 projections may be over 60,000. It will be some time before we have the final numbers. More than half\u2014a substantial proportion\u2014of those were attributable to opioid drugs. When I first learned about this, we were talking about the heroin crisis, and people thought about heroin and oxycodone, which is a lawful prescription drug that often can be abused. Increasingly, the challenge we face is about fentanyl, which is an even more hazardous drug that poses a danger even to our first responders, police, firefighters, and paramedics, who are responding to scenes of overdoses because of how deadly and dangerous that drug can be. This is a very significant challenge to us. There are a lot of issues, a lot of ways we can go about addressing it. One of which, you talked about, the gangs that bring drugs into your home state. I know from my experience as U.S. Attorney, that\u2019s an area where our federal prosecutors and DEA agents do a lot of good. Law enforcement isn\u2019t the only solution to the heroin and opioid crisis, but from our perspective, it\u2019s one of the key tools the Department of Justice has to target these organizations and try to identify the sources of supply and put those drug dealers out of business. One of the most important things I think we\u2019re going to do this year under this budget is that we are going to be able to fund about 900 additional employees for DEA. These are not new positions. My understanding from our budget experts is these are positions that are existing but, for the most part, were not filled because of budgetary constraints. So we anticipate we\u2019ll have up to 900 more personnel on the front lines of DEA, we\u2019ll have additional federal prosecutors, and that, from the Department\u2019s perspective, will help us to combat that. But, if I may continue, it\u2019s not just about law enforcement. There are many other areas and many other ways that we can combat drug abuse. The Justice Department obviously focuses primarily on law enforcement, but we do have these grand programs that allows us to do other things. The COPS program, as you mentioned, is proposed to be eliminated in this budget, but we request $7 million funding that I think is not in this year\u2019s budget, but we do request $40.4 million in additional federal funding for DEA prescription opioid and heroin enforcement programs. So this is a matter not of reducing our emphasis on that issue, but of reprioritizing the money to places we think it will be more effective. This will allow DEA to expand funding for its 360 strategy, which is intended to illustrate that it\u2019s not just about law enforcement, it\u2019s a 360 degree program to try to reduce drug abuse. It will allow us to enhance operations against domestic cartels that are responsible for drug distribution, and to enhance and establish regulatory and enforcement groups in the diversion control program and increase funding for our prescription drug disposal programs, because often drugs that are legally prescribed and not used, they may be diverted to illegal uses. So through all those ways, Senator, I can commit to you that we are very much attuned; I will be watching those overdose numbers, and I will not be satisfied until I see that trend turn around and start going the other direction."},

A transcript follows of Senator Collins\u2019 Q&A with Dr. Anderson on ways to stop the misuse and abuse of closed distribution systems that block generic competition: COLLINS: Dr. Anderson, let me start by saying it\u2019s great to see you here again. You were extremely helpful last year when the Senate Aging Committee conducted a yearlong investigation into the four drug companies that had acquired decades-old off-patent drugs and then dramatically increased the prices, in one case by literally 5,000 percent overnight. What we found in that investigation is that companies were able to ward off competition by putting their drugs in closed distribution systems or specialty pharmacies that made it very difficult for generic companies to get sufficient quantities of the drugs to do the bio-equivalency studies that are required by the FDA. And we particularly found that there were problems with abuses of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies\u2014that\u2019s what\u2019s known as REMS\u2014and it\u2019s used for drugs with increased risk factors. But instead, it was being misused to prevent potential competitors from getting the drugs that they needed for the bio-equivalency studies, and indeed, Janet Woodcock from the FDA testified that this was a real problem. Could you elaborate on that issue and what we can do to ensure that companies do not block access to the quantities of drugs that are needed for the bio-equivalency studies, and second\u2014since this is going to be the only question I\u2019m going to get\u2014another idea would be to amend the Medicare Part D contracts that outline the participation in the formularies that are covered by Medicare Part D to require companies participating in Part D to make available sufficient quantities of their medications for these bio-equivalency exams conducted by potential competitors. Could you comment on those two issues? ANDERSON: I will do my best. Thank you for those kind words, it\u2019s been great to work with you and your staff over the last year and a half helping to put together your report and then the legislation I know that you\u2019ve been able to get through this committee. So it\u2019s been a great effort and I appreciate my little part in that activity. So what\u2019s happening right now is you have this REMS program, which is established by the Congress and it\u2019s to make sure that the drugs are safe. However, what\u2019s happening is that companies are using this idea to block other companies from actually getting access to the drug. So people like Martin Shkreli, which your report showed, he essentially created this entity called the \u201climited distribution chain\u201d to keep everyone from getting access to his drug who was a competitor to him. So no one could actually get access to the drug. So there\u2019s a number of ways that you and others could deal with this problem, one of which is to essentially say to every drug company, \u201cyou have to make that drug available to anybody who wants to manufacture it.\u201d And I was on a panel with Janet Woodcock, over in government oversight, a little while ago, and she said, I can\u2019t do anything about it. I can say that you can make it available if it\u2019s on REMS, but I can\u2019t force you to make it available. I think only the Congress can essentially say that. There is about a $3 billion savings that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated could happen if essentially Congress were simply to say to the company, \u201cyou got to make that available.\u201d There are a number of bills, and you have one of them, that are about that particular area. So you could amend the Part D activity, you could do a whole variety of different activities, but essentially the idea here is to make sure that there is in fact competition in the marketplace. COLLINS: Thank you so much, those are clearly areas that we need to pursue. +++ The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions recently   of Senator Collins\u2019 Making Pharmaceutical Markets More Competitive Act as part of the Food and Drug Reauthorization Act. The bipartisan legislation, co-sponsored by Senator Claire McCaskill, takes a number of steps to enhance regulatory certainty for generic drug companies by setting forth a priority review timeline for generic applications, providing enhanced communications with eligible sponsors, improving transparency, and setting clear expectations about facility inspections. Senator Collins, as Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, led the only   last Congress into the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to the egregious price spikes for certain drugs. From the beginning, the investigation strived to understand why companies can make these large price increases and to identify which policies should be considered to counter these disturbing practices."},
{"title": "Senator Collins Questions Attorney General Sessions at Intelligence Committee Hearing", "date": ["Posted Tue, 06/13/2017 - 16:01"], "release": "\u00a0At a U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing this afternoon, U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a member of the committee, questioned Attorney General Jeff Sessions. A transcript of Senator Collins\u2019 Q&A with Mr. Sessions follows: COLLINS: Attorney General Sessions, I want to clarify who did what with regard to the firing of Mr. Comey. First of all, let me ask you when did you have your first conversation with Rod Rosenstein about Mr. Comey? SESSIONS: We talked about it before either one of us were confirmed. It was a topic of, you know, conversation among people who had served in the department a long time. They knew that what had happened that fall was pretty dramatically unusual. Many people felt it was very wrong, and so it was in that context that we discussed it, and we both found that we shared a common view that a fresh start would be appropriate. COLLINS: And this was based on Mr. Comey's handling of the investigation involving Hillary Clinton in which you said that he usurped the authority of prosecutors at the Department of Justice? SESSIONS: Yes, that was part of it, and the commenting on the investigation in ways that go beyond the proper policies. We need to restore, Senator Collins, I think, the classic discipline in the department. My team, we've discussed this. There\u2019s been too much leaking and too much talking publicly about investigations. In the long run, the department's historic rule that you remain mum about ongoing investigations is the better policy. COLLINS: Now subsequently the president asked for you to put your views in writing you've testified today, and I believe that you were right to recuse yourself from the ongoing Russian investigation, but then on May 9th you wrote to the president recommending that Mr. Comey be dismissed. And obviously this went back many months to the earlier conversations you had had with Mr. Rosenstein, but my question is why do you believe that your recommendation to fire Director Comey was not inconsistent with your March 2nd recusal? SESSIONS: Thank you. The recusal involved one case involved in the Department of Justice and in the FBI. They conduct thousands of investigations. I\u2019m the attorney general of the United States. It\u2019s my responsibility to our Judiciary Committee and other committees to ensure that that department is run properly. I have to make difficult decisions, and I do not believe that it is a sound position to say that if you recuse for a single case involving any one of the great agencies like DEA or U.S. Marshals or ATF that are part of the Department of Justice, you can't make a decision about the leadership in that agency. COLLINS: Now, if you had known that the president subsequently was going to go on TV and in an interview with Lester Holt of NBC would say that this \u201cRussian thing\u201d was the reason for his decision to dismiss the FBI director, would you have felt uncomfortable about the timing of the decision? SESSIONS: Well, I would just say this, Senator Collins. I don't think it's appropriate to deal with those kind of hypotheticals. I have to deal in actual issues, and I would respectfully not comment on that. COLLINS: Well, let me ask you this. In retrospect, do you believe that it would have been better for you to have stayed out of the decision to fire Director Comey? SESSIONS: I think it's my responsibility. I mean, I was appointed to be attorney general. Supervising all the federal agencies is my responsibility. Trying to get the very best people in those agencies at the top of them is my responsibility, and I think I had a duty to do so. COLLINS: Now, Director Comey testified that he was not comfortable telling you about his one-on-one conversation with the president on February 14th because he believed that you would shortly recuse yourself from the Russian investigation, which you did, yet Director Comey testified that he told no one else at the department outside of the senior leadership team at the FBI. Do you believe that the director had an obligation to bring the information about the president saying that he hoped he could let Michael Flynn go to someone else at the Department of Justice? There are an awful lot of lawyers at the Department of Justice, some 10,000 by last count. SESSIONS: I think the appropriate thing would have been for Director Comey to talk with the acting deputy attorney general, who is his direct supervisor. That was Dana Boente, who had 33 years in the Department of Justice and was even then still serving for six years and continues to serve as attorney general appointed by President Obama, so he's a man of great integrity and everybody knows it, a man of decency and judgment. If he had concerns, I think he should have raised it to Deputy Attorney General Boent,e who would be the appropriate person in any case really, but if he had any concern that I might be recusing myself, that would be a double reason for him to share it with Deputy Attorney General Boente. COLLINS: Thank you."},

And he emphasized time and again the absolutely heroic behavior, the extraordinary bravery of the Capitol Police officers who were part of Representative Scalise\u2019s detail. He said that without these two police officers, that he has no doubt that many more people would have been injured and likely killed. \"So I think it's important for us to pause and express our gratitude to the men and women of the Capitol Police force, and indeed the first responders and law enforcement officers everywhere who day after day put their lives on the line for our country.

This economic impact includes creating and sustaining nearly 3,000 local businesses and more than 20,000 jobs. Marine businesses and fishermen in coastal communities rely on the knowledge and skills of Sea Grant staff and outreach materials.

She also called on the Navy to improve the capacity and capability of public shipyard drydocks to maintain the existing fleet and accommodate additional ships.\u00a0 \u201cI am pleased that the Navy\u2019s request includes $62 million to consolidate the paint, blast, and rubber fabrication facilities at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine,\u201d   \u201cAs you know, we\u2019re very proud of this shipyard, which has been called the \u2018gold standard\u2019\u2026by which the government should measure shipyards due to the efficient, high-quality work, and this is a much-needed project that will replace some outdated and inefficient buildings.\u201d U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Dixon Smith agreed with Senator Collins\u2019 characterization of Portsmouth Naval Shipyard\u2019s impressive work. \u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege to visit your shipyard more than once in my last job, and they do a great job up there,\u201d   \u201cAnd I know that you\u2019re very proud of them as you should be; they do phenomenal work.\u201d Senator Collins also expressed concern about the general state of shipyard infrastructure, particularly the lack of sufficient drydock capability and capacity to maintain the fleet over the next 30 years, as well as the slow pace of modernization. \u201cWithout major improvements at all of our nation\u2019s public shipyards, the fleet\u2019s readiness will be seriously affected over the next 30 years due to a lack of drydock operational availability,\u201d   \u201cAs the Navy considers its Shipyard Infrastructure Modernization Plan, how do you intend to prioritize public shipyard capacity and modernization?\u201d Vice Admiral Dixon acknowledged that the current condition of many drydocks is an issue and that more capacity will be necessary as additional Virginia-class submarines and Ford-class aircraft carriers are delivered to the Navy. \u201cWhat\u2019s pressurizing our drydocks is that they\u2019re old, in many cases we have not maintained them. Some are from World War II as you know,\u201d   \u201cThe two principal drivers are the Virginia payload module, when that delivers to the fleet, and also the Ford [aircraft] carrier. And so as we go and prioritize those projects, we need to make sure against the other competing issues we have that we get those into the budget and approved in time to deliver and improve those drydocks before we have to put the first Virginia into drydock or the Ford.\u201d"},

COLLINS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Coats, first let me thank you for a very cogent explanation of Section 702 and the fact that it cannot be used to target any person in the United States, whether or not that person is an American. I think there\u2019s a lot of confusion about Section 702, and I appreciate your clear explanation this morning. I have a question for each of you that I would like to ask, and I want to start with Adm. Rogers. Adm. Rogers, did anyone at the White House direct you on how to respond today, or were there discussions of executive privilege? ROGERS: Have I asked the White House is it their intent to invoke executive privilege? Yes. The answer I gave you today reflects my answer, no one else\u2019s. COLLINS: Director Coats? COATS: My answer is exactly the same. COLLINS: Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein? ROSENSTEIN: I have not had any communications with the White House about invoking executive privilege today. COLLINS: Director McCabe? MCCABE: I have not had any conversations with the White House about executive privilege today, either. COLLINS: Adm. Rogers, in January, the F.B.I., the C.I.A., and N.S.A. jointly issued an intelligence committee assessment on Russian involvement in the presidential elections. You\u2019ve testified today that the I.C. relied, in part, on 702 authorities to support its conclusion that the Russians were involved in trying to influence the 2016 elections. Can you provide us with an update on N.S.A.\u2019s further work in this area? ROGERS: In terms of the Russian efforts? COLLINS: Yes. ROGERS: Yes ma\u2019am. We continue to focus analytic and collection effort trying to generate insights as to what the Russians and others are doing particularly with respect to U.S. infrastructure, U.S. processes like elections, we continue to generate insights on a regular basis. If my memory is right, I testified before the SSCI, we did open threat assessment. In that hearing, I think it was the 11th of May, I reiterated that we continue to see similar activity that we identified and highlighted in the January report. Those trends continue, much of that activity continues. COLLINS: It\u2019s my understanding that President Obama requested the report that was issued in January. Is that correct? ROGERS: Yes ma\u2019am he asked for a consolidated, single input from the IC as to the question did the Russians or did they not attempt to influence the U.S. election process. COLLINS: So could you explain the difference between the requests from President Obama for that unclassified assessment and the allegations that President Trump requested that you publicly report on whether or not there was any intelligence concerning collusion between the Russians and President Trump\u2019s campaign. ROGERS: So, I apologize, I guess I\u2019m confused by the question. Again, I\u2019m not going to comment on any interactions with the President. I just don\u2019t feel that that is appropriate. As I previously testified, I stand by that report. COLLINS: Let me ask a broader question that I truly am trying to get a handle on. And that is how does the intelligence community reach a decision on whether or not to comply with a request that comes from the President of the United States? Obviously, you report to the President of the United States, and I\u2019m interested in what process you go through to decide whether or not to undertake a task that\u2019s been assigned by the President, by any President. ROGERS: Off the top of my head, I would say that we comply unless we have reason to believe that we are being directed to do something that is illegal, immoral, or unethical, in which case we will not execute that."},

{"title": "Senator Collins Questions Former FBI Director James Comey", "date": ["Posted Thu, 06/08/2017 - 11:40"], "release": "\u00a0At a U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing this morning, U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a member of the committee, questioned former FBI Director James Comey. A transcript of Senator Collins\u2019 Q&A with the Mr. Comey follows: COLLINS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Comey, let me begin by thanking you for your voluntary compliance with our request to appear before this committee and assist us in this very important investigation. I want, first, to ask you about your conversations with the president, the three conversations in which you told him that he was not under investigation. The first was during your January 6th meeting, according to your testimony, in which it appears that you actually volunteered that assurance. Is that correct? COMEY: That's correct. COLLINS: Did you limit that statement to counterintelligence investigations, or were you talking about any kind of F.B.I. investigation? COMEY: I didn't use the term counterintelligence. I was speaking to him and briefing him about some salacious and unverified material. It was in the context of that that he had a strong and defensive reaction about that not being true. My reading of it was it was important for me to assure him we were not personally investigating him. So the context then was actually narrower, focused on what I just talked to him about. It was very important because it was, first, true, and second, I was very much about being in kind of a J. Edgar Hoover type situation. I didn't want him thinking I was briefing him on this to sort of hang it over him in some way. I was briefing him on it because we had been told by the media that it was about to launch. We didn't want to be keeping that from him. He needed to know this was being said. But I was very keen not to leave him with an impression that the Bureau was trying to do something to him. So that's the context in which I said, \u201cSir, we're not personally investigating you.\u201d COLLINS: And that's why you volunteered the information? COMEY: Yes, ma'am. COLLINS: Then on the January 27th dinner, you told the President that he should be careful about asking you to investigate because, quote, \u201cyou might create a narrative that we are investigating him personally, which we weren\u2019t.\u201d Again, were you limiting that statement to counterintelligence investigations or more broadly such as a criminal investigation? COMEY: The context was similar. I didn\u2019t modify the word \u201cinvestigation.\u201d Again, he was reacting strongly against the unverified material saying, \u201cI\u2019m tempted to order you to investigate it.\u201d In the context of that I said \u201cSir, you ought to be careful about that, it might create a narrative that we\u2019re investigating you personally.\u201d COLLINS: And then there was the March 30th phone call with the President in which you reminded him that congressional leaders had been briefed that the F.B.I. was not personally investigating President Trump. Again, was that statement to congressional leaders and to the president limited to counterintelligence investigations, or was it a broader statement? I\u2019m trying to understand if there was any king of investigation of the president underway. COMEY: No, and if I misunderstood I apologize. We briefed the congressional leadership about what Americans we had opened counterintelligence investigation cases on. And we specifically said that the President was not one of those Americans. But there was no other investigation of the President that we were not mentioning at the time. The context was counterintelligence, but no, I was not trying to hide some criminal investigation. COLLINS: Was the President under investigation at the time of your dismissal on May 9th? COMEY: No. COLLINS: I\u2019d like to now turn to the conversations with the President about Michael Flynn, which have been discussed at great length. And first, let me make very clear that the president never should have cleared the room, and he never should have asked you as you reported, to let the investigation go. But I remain puzzled by your response. Your response was, \u201cI agree that Michael Flynn is a good guy.\u201d You could have said, \u201cMr. President, this meeting is inappropriate. This response could compromise the investigation. You should not be making such a request. It\u2019s fundamental to the operation of our government that the F.B.I. be insulated from this kind of political pressure.\u201d You\u2019ve talked a bit today about how you were stunned by the President making the request. But my question to you is, later on, upon reflection, did you go to anyone at the Department of Justice and ask them to call the White House Counsel\u2019s office and explain that the president had to have a far better understanding and appreciation of his role vis a vis the F.B.I. COMEY: In general, I did. I spoke to the Attorney General, and I spoke to the new Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Rosenstein, when he took office and explained my serious concern about the way in which the President is interacting especially with the F.B.I. And I specifically, as I said in my testimony, I told the Attorney General, \u201cIt can\u2019t happen that you get kicked out of the room and the President talks to me.\u201d But why didn\u2019t we raise the specific? It was of investigative interest to us to try and figure out what just happened with the president\u2019s request, so I did not want to alert the White House about what just happened until we figured out what are we going to do with this investigatively. COLLINS: Your testimony was that you went to Attorney General Sessions and said \u201cdon\u2019t ever leave me alone with him again.\u201d Are you saying that you also told him that he had made a request that you let it go with regard to part of the investigation of Michael Flynn? COMEY: No, I specifically did not. I did not. COLLINS: You mentioned that from your very first meeting with the president you decided to write a memo memorializing the conversation. What was it about that very first meeting that made you write a memo when you had not done that with two previous presidents? COMEY: As I said, a combination of things: a gut feeling as an important overlay, but the circumstances (that I was alone), the subject matter, and the nature of the person that I was interacting with and my read of that person. And really just a gut feel laying on top of all of that that this is going to be important to protect this organization that I make records of this. COLLINS: Finally, did you show copies of your memos to anyone outside the Department of Justice? COMEY: Yes. COLLINS: And to whom did you show copies? COMEY: The President tweeted on Friday after I got fired that I better hope there\u2019s not tapes. I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, because it didn\u2019t dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our conversation, there might be a tape. And my judgment was, I needed to get that out into the public square, so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with the reporter. I didn\u2019t do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. So I asked a close friend of mine to do it. COLLINS: And was that Mr. Wittes? COMEY: No. COLLINS: Who was that? COMEY: A good friend of mine who is a professor at Columbia Law School."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cMeet the Press Daily\u201d June 8, 2017 TODD: Joining me now is Maine Republican Senator Susan Collins. She is a member, of course, of the Senate Intel[ligence] Committee that questioned Director Comey publicly and privately today, and as we were discussing, Senator, you got\u2014your question got\u2014him to admit being a leaker. Did you know that was coming? COLLINS: I must admit that I did not know and that it came as a big surprise to me. In fact I was stunned at the revelation. When I asked the question, I wondered whom the director had shown his memos to. I did not expect him to admit that he had given them to a friend of his with the express purpose of having that friend leak it to the media in order to prompt the appointment of a special counsel, which it did. TODD: Your reaction to that. Appropriate? COLLINS: I don't think it was appropriate. I would argue that that was a government produced document. It was a work document. And I think it qualifies as a leak. The irony is that the former director of the F.B.I. has always been very annoyed when there are leaks. And then it turns out that he leaked a document himself. TODD: Do you believe Director Comey was forthcoming with you guys today? COLLINS: I do. I believe that his testimony, which was under oath, was candid, it was straightforward, it was quite thorough. He answered the questions that he could answer. There were some that got into the lane of the special counsel which he appropriately could not answer. TODD: You went behind closed doors. Obviously there's plenty you can't share because of that. I think we\u2019re over-classifying\u2014that\u2019s a whole \u2018nother topic of discussion\u2014but did he satisfactorily answer questions there? Did he get into the probe itself? COLLINS: He answered more questions in the private closed session. But that was a very short session compared to this morning's. TODD: Why? COLLINS: I\u2019m not sure, and frankly I think we would benefit from having a longer session with Mr. Comey in private. TODD: A couple of things. Since you now have the president's personal lawyer confirming some parts of Director Comey's testimony, denying other parts, including the direct quotes which are at issue here, should Congress subpoena? Do you want to subpoena the White House for supposed tapes if they exist? COLLINS: If the tapes exist, I believe the special counsel should have them and our committee should have them. After all, they\u2019re two different investigations with two different purposes. Our investigation is a broad investigation into Russian attempts to influence the elections last fall\u2014it\u2019s a counterintelligence investigation. TODD: Do you think it needs to be subpoenaed? Do you think you\u2019re going to have to issue a subpoena? COLLINS: Well, I would hope that the White House would voluntarily turn over any relevant documents or tapes. There\u2019s a big issue as to whether the tapes even exist or whether or not that was some sort of Tweet that the President put out for whatever purpose. TODD: Do you think the president needs to clear this up? COLLINS: Yes, I do. I think it\u2019s important that it be cleared up. TODD: Look, you\u2019ve got a he said he said here. You\u2019re going to be put in the position of deciding who\u2019s more credible, the former director of the F.B.I. or the President of the United States. COLLINS: Well, it\u2019s really going to be the special counsel's job, who will have access to more witnesses than we do\u2026 TODD: You don\u2019t want to make that judgement? COLLINS: \u2026and who\u2019s looking at the criminal aspect of this. If you're talking about an obstruction of justice issue, that really is the job of the special counsel. But I think it is important for us to know the extent of White House involvement or the Trump campaign involvement and whether or not there was any collusion with the Russians last fall by any member of President Trump's circle. TODD: I\u2019ll admit, it is not clear to me whether or not former Director Comey confirmed whether there currently is now an investigation to whether the president obstructed justice. Are you clear? Is there an active investigation by the special counsel on whether the president obstructed justice? Do you feel like you know this fact? COLLINS: I believe that Mr. Comey confirmed that as of the date that he was dismissed, on May 9th, there was no investigation of the president himself. There may well be\u2014there undoubtedly are\u2014investigations of people in the president's circle. TODD: That I understand. But I\u2019m talking about the president himself and the obstruction of justice issue. During the testimony, he implied that the special counsel was investigating whether this was obstruction of justice. COLLINS: I think that wasn't clear. I think he said that he really couldn't opine on that, but it is something that one would expect that the special counsel would look at all the evidence. TODD: What unanswered question do you feel like still lingers out there that really bothers you after this testimony today? COLLINS: Well, we still don't have an answer to the basic question of whether or not members of President Trump's campaign staff collaborated with the Russians. It is pretty clear that the Russians tried to influence the election. That\u2019s not to say they changed votes. But it is clear that they tried through a public information and disinformation campaign, the release of e-mails, paid trolls, etc. to plant false stories to influence the election. What is not clear, and what we don't know the answer to, is the very important question of whether or not any members of President Trump's campaign were involved in that effort. TODD: All right, Senator Susan Collins, I'll leave it there. I know it\u2019s been a long day."},

{"title": "Honoring the Brave Men and Women Who Have Earned the Purple Heart ", "date": ["Posted Mon, 06/05/2017 - 11:42"], "release": "In small towns and big cities across our country, Americans recently gathered to commemorate Memorial Day and honor those who died in the service of our country. This solemn day of gratitude allows us to reflect on the fact that our freedom is a gift purchased at the greatest possible price. And while we thank our men and women in uniform for their sacrifices and contributions, we also thank the families \u2013 the husbands and wives, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, and mothers and fathers \u2013 who endure the separation, the anxiety, and, at times, the grief that are also part of freedom\u2019s price. There is no more powerful symbol of the sacrifices made by members of the armed services than the Purple Heart. The men and women who put themselves in harm\u2019s way, and who carry the wounds of battle, along with the loved ones who care for them, deserve our deepest respect. In preparation for Memorial Day this year, I authored a Senate Resolution encouraging people of the United States to learn more about the history of the Purple Heart medal and honor its recipients. The Purple Heart\u2019s history goes as far back as the founding of our nation. General George Washington established what is now known as the Purple Heart Medal when he issued an order establishing the Military Badge of Merit on August 7, 1782. General Washington wanted the award to be used to recognize meritorious action performed by members of the Continental Army, and it took the form of a purple heart. The Military Badge of Merit was discontinued after the Revolution and was not revived until 1932, when the Purple Heart medal was authorized as its official successor decoration. On February 22, 1932, the 200th Anniversary of the birth of George Washington, then-Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur resurrected the award, and it was redesignated as the Purple Heart. Quite appropriately, this reestablished Purple Heart Medal exhibits the bust and profile of George Washington. It is around this time that the Purple Heart became synonymous with those unfortunate heroes who were killed or wounded in combat. Since 1932, the United States military has awarded more than 1.7 million Purple Hearts. Just as the Purple Heart Medal has held a special meaning to its millions of recipients and family members, it also has special significance to my family. My father, Don Collins, is a World War II veteran who was wounded twice during the Battle of the Bulge in Europe. He earned two Purple Hearts and the Bronze Star. One of my earliest childhood memories is of my father taking me to the Memorial Day parade in my hometown of Caribou. He would hoist me high upon his shoulders, and there, from the best vantage point along the parade route, I would see the hats come off and the hands go over hearts as our Flag went by. It was from him that I first learned to honor and respect our veterans. This year, I had the honor to participate in the Memorial Day ceremony in Caribou, and the spirit of patriotism and gratitude I saw growing up is still strong. Now in its 14th year, the beautiful Northern Maine Veterans Cemetery is the work of area veterans, families, and supporters working together. Two years ago, a wonderful Purple Heart Memorial was donated to Caribou Memorial Park by Cary Medical Center. The Purple Heart is a reminder that freedom is a gift purchased at the greatest possible price. It is vitally important for all Americans to learn the history of this important military award and understand and honor the sacrifices of the many men and women in uniform who have earned the Purple Heart."},

Approximately 30 million Americans experience age-related hearing loss, yet only about 14 percent of those with hearing loss use assistive hearing technology, often because they cannot afford costly hearing aids. \u201cHearing aids allow Americans who experience hearing loss to communicate with friends, family, coworkers, and others as well as participate fully in society.

The legislation, which also has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congresswoman Chellie Pingree and Congressman Bruce Poliquin, would put an end to repetitive, mandatory inspections of urchins and sea cucumbers exported from the country. The unnecessary inspections are causing the highly perishable products to be held in warehouses for prolonged periods of time, which increases the likelihood they will spoil.\u00a0 \u201cThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has overstepped its bounds with these redundant, and frankly, unnecessary inspections \u2013 and it\u2019s Maine\u2019s harvesters, processors, and shippers who are paying the price,\u201d  . \u201cThis legislation will help get the federal government off their backs so they can thrive in their work and help support Maine\u2019s economy.\u201d \u201cIn order to grow our economy and help create employment opportunities for Mainers, we must eliminate unnecessary red-tape that stifles job creation,\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOur commonsense legislation will put an end to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s overly restrictive inspection requirements that do nothing to improve health or safety while needlessly reducing profits for harvesters and creating hurdles for exporters to ship their products.\u201d Until several years ago, the sea urchin and sea cucumber industries were able to export their products out of the United States free from regulatory burdens because fishery products are exempt from import and export inspection by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) so long as they are intended for human or animal consumption and the species is not listed as injurious, threatened or endangered, or protected internationally under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Congress intended FWS to guard against wildlife trafficking \u2013 not to inspect otherwise harmless seafood. However, FWS has too narrowly interpreted the definition of \u2018shellfish and fishery products\u2019 \u2013 for which there has been a longstanding inspection exemption \u2013 to exclude sea urchins and sea cucumbers. As a result, exporters now must pay inspection fees and obtain licenses, the cost of which cuts into their profit margin as well as the price they can pay harvesters. Further, FWS requires 48 hours notice to carry out an inspection, which greatly affects the quality and even feasibility of such perishable products reaching their destination retail market in the desired high quality condition. Last year, the Senate   authored by Senator King that would have exempted urchins from mandatory exemptions. In June 2015, Senator King had also sent   to the heads of two separate Senate subcommittees urging them to help stop FWS from conducting the unnecessary inspections."},

{"title": "Honoring Our Nation\u2019s Law Enforcement Officers", "date": ["Posted Tue, 05/23/2017 - 11:32"], "release": "In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a joint resolution of Congress proclaiming May 15 of each year to be Peace Officers Memorial Day, with the week containing that day designated as National Police Week. In 1991, America\u2019s respect for the men and women of our law enforcement community took concrete form with the dedication of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, D.C. Located in Judiciary Square, the seat of several federal and municipal courts, the memorial\u2019s 304-foot-long marble walls bear the names of the more than 20,000 officers who gave their lives in the line of duty throughout our history, dating back to the first known death in 1791. Unlike most memorials in our nation\u2019s capital, this one changes every year with the addition of new names. On this year\u2019s Peace Officers Memorial Day, the names of the 143 officers killed in the line of duty in 2016 were added. In addition, Lieutenant Rene Goupil, a Maine State Police officer with two decades of service who died while on duty in 1990, was added to the memorial this year. I was honored to meet with members of Lt. Goupil\u2019s family in my office. I was honored to co-sponsor the Senate resolution designating the week of May 15 through May 21 as National Police Week 2017. Our resolution declares that federal, state, local, and tribal police officers, sheriffs, and other law enforcement officers across the United States serve with valor, dignity and integrity; that they pursue justice for all and perform their duties with fidelity to the constitutional and civil rights of all; that their service to their communities is unyielding, despite inherent dangers in the performance of their duties; and that the vigilance, compassion, and decency of law enforcement officers are the best defense of society against individuals who seek to do harm. In addition, our resolution acknowledges that law-enforcement officers who made the ultimate sacrifice should be honored and remembered, and that the loved ones they leave behind should receive not only our heartfelt condolences, but also our unwavering support. Supporting the families of these brave men and women is a national obligation. That is why I introduced the bipartisan Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act to assist the children of fallen members of our first responder community \u2013 law-enforcement officers, firefighters, and emergency medical services workers\u2014who might not be able to afford a college education. My bill would help these children by making them eligible for the maximum Pell Grant award. Each year, some 150 first responders are killed in the line of duty. We count on our first responders to be our first boots on the ground when tragedy strikes. These brave men and women make tremendous sacrifices to protect our communities, and we owe them all a debt of gratitude. For first responders who lose their lives in the line of duty, this bipartisan legislation would increase their children's access to an affordable education and help to ease the financial onus placed on their families. In some cases, these grants make the difference for whether a child can attend college. Our National Police Week Resolution also recognizes our obligation to ensure that law enforcement officers have the equipment, training, and resources necessary to carry out their duties and meet the challenges on the ground. The bipartisan funding bill that was signed into law in early May of this year provides $2.4 billion for state and local law enforcement activities, including the Office on Violence Against Women, juvenile justice programs, and community crime prevention grant programs. The bipartisan funding bill also provides $276 million for law-enforcement programs related to the heroin and opioid abuse crisis that is causing so much harm in Maine and throughout the country. The funding will be used for treatment programs for those in prison, expanded grant programs for community policing, and other efforts. There is no better way to signal our appreciation for law enforcement officers\u2019 dedication than to provide them with the resources that they need. National Police Week reminds us of the debt we all owe to law-enforcement officers for their commitment to safer communities, for their bravery, and for their sacrifice. It is a debt we repay both with the resources they need to do a difficult job and with our thanks for a job well done."},

{"title": "Senator Collins Introduces Legislation to Protect Community Banks", "date": ["Posted Thu, 05/25/2017 - 13:51"], "release": "\u00a0U.S. Senator Susan Collins introduced the Community Bank Sensible Regulation Act of 2017, legislation that would allow financial regulators to exempt small community banks from unnecessary and burdensome requirements. Her bill would protect small financial institutions from highly complex regulations that are intended for larger banks whose failure would risk the collapse of the financial system. \u201cAll banks, large and small, should be well-capitalized and properly regulated, but that does not mean that our financial regulators must impose a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d regulatory regime across the board,\u201d   \u201cCommunity banks play an essential role in meeting the credit needs of their customers, particularly small businesses, homeowners, and farmers. My legislation would allow regulators to exempt community banks from unnecessary and burdensome regulations where it is in the public interest to do so.\u201d Some regulations that are appropriate or essential for larger banks may make no sense when applied to community banks. For example, current law requires community banks to demonstrate that they are in compliance with the Volcker Rule--which restricts proprietary trading and hedge fund investments by banks--even though community banks rarely engage in such trading. Even so, community banks must shoulder the burden of complying with this complex regulation. According to the Government Accountability Office, smaller banks are \u201cdisproportionately affected by increased regulation because they are less able to absorb additional costs.\u201d These costs are significant and put community banks at a competitive disadvantage since the financial burden of complying with regulations is two-and-a-half times greater for small banks than for large banks. Over the past two decades, the share of the U.S. banking industry represented by community banks has declined from 40 percent to just 18 percent, which is due in part to the cost of complying with these unnecessary regulations. Despite representing less than one-fifth of banking assets, however, community banks are responsible for half of our nation\u2019s small business loans, which help spur job creation. By allowing regulators to tailor their regulations to take the distinctive nature of community banks into account, the Community Bank Sensible Regulation Act would help prevent further consolidation of the banking industry, preserve small businesses\u2019 access to credit, and allow community banks to continue to meet the needs of their customers."},

At great risk to themselves, the 23rd, composed of a mere 1,100 men, impersonated up to two divisions (30,000 men) physically, sonically, and radiographically to the enemy. The 23rd was so effective, they held a position in the middle of the line at the Battle of the Bulge, giving the 82nd precious days to get into position. Captured German officers and documents related to the operations of both units demonstrate that the Germans were utterly convinced by the units\u2019 deceptions and redeployed units and assets in response. \u201cOur nation will always be grateful to the members of the \u2018Ghost Army\u2019 soldiers who served with distinction during World War II,\u201d   \u201cTheir courage and resourcefulness were pivotal in the European theater, helping to secure the Allied victory and likely saving many American lives,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cOur legislation, which would recognize these soldiers with Congress\u2019 highest civilian honor, is particularly meaningful to me since my father, a World War II veteran who earned two Purple Hearts and the Bronze Star, was wounded twice during the Battle of the Bulge.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m honored to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues to introduce this legislation recognizing those who served in the top-secret \u2018Ghost Army\u2019 during World War II,\u201d   \u201cThese unique units, which included several soldiers from Maine, used innovative and creative techniques to confuse the enemy, reduce casualties, and support several Allied victories in Europe. Their ingenuity in the face of grave danger continues to inspire us as we craft strategies to respond to the diverse set of new threats facing our nation today.\u201d \u201cThese brave soldiers brought unique, creative skills to the most dangerous and critical missions,\u201d   \u201cThey epitomized the American can-do, innovative spirit. Against the odds, they convinced the enemy forces that they were the ones at a tactical disadvantage. It time that brave patriots like Jack McGlynn of Medford, Massachusetts and all of these units are recognized for their critical contributions to the Allied victory in World War II.\u201d A copy of the legislation can be found  .

{"title": "Meeting Two Young Mainers Who are Making a Positive Difference in Their Communities", "date": ["Posted Fri, 05/26/2017 - 16:18"], "release": "One of the greatest privileges I have serving Maine in the United States Senate is the opportunity to know outstanding people from our state who have devoted part of their busy lives to community service. Whether we meet in Washington or back home, I always come away from these meetings inspired by their commitment and encouraged for the future of our state and our nation. I recently had the opportunity to meet two such remarkable young people \u2013 Bella Rossborough of Kennebunk and Kathleen Waeldner of Yarmouth \u2013 when they were in Washington to receive 2017 Prudential Spirit of Community awards, which recognize students for exemplary community service. From nearly 31,000 nominees nationwide, only two students from each state and the District of Columbia are selected for this recognition, so it was a particular honor to meet these two young women from Maine. Although they have dedicated themselves to different types of civic involvement, they are united by a desire to make their communities better, to encourage others to get involved, and to grow personally from their experiences. Bella is a 12-year-old sixth-grader at the Middle School of the Kennebunks. When she read about how plastic bags harm the environment and wildlife, she took action to reduce their use in her town. After writing to the town manager, Bella followed up by meeting with the Board of Selectmen. Then she began working with the Kennebunk Energy Efficiency Committee to explore ways to reduce the use of plastic bags. Joined by members of the committee, a friend, her mother, and a teacher, Bella distributed information and reusable bags at town events. She raised awareness of the issue in radio and newspaper interviews, personally visited local merchants to inform them of the benefits of reusable bags, and raised the issue with the town\u2019s Council. Bella\u2019s research, determination, and thoughtful approach truly made a difference. Kathleen is an 18-year-old senior at Yarmouth High School. A documentary film about hungry children left her with tears in her eyes and determination in her heart. She started by working with a local community services agency and a nonprofit organization to develop and then expand a summer meal program for at-risk children in her town, and soon was packing weekend food bags for students from low-income families for days when they do not receive school lunches. Then she wondered how those students managed during the summer, and learned that a summer lunch program was about to start in Yarmouth. She not only stepped forward to help launch the new program, but also recruited other teens to volunteer. The program was scheduled to end three weeks before the end of summer, but Kathleen and another student worked to extend it. The next year, Kathleen became co-coordinator of the program and helped expand it to include both breakfast and lunch, as well as activities such as playing games, going on field trips, and making friendship bracelets. The commitment demonstrated by both girls benefit their communities today and will for years to come as the at-risk children Kathleen cares for grow into healthy adolescents and as Bella continues her efforts to improve the environment. And both benefit as well from learning the self-reliance and sense of accomplishment that come from taking on responsibilities and meeting them. As Kathleen said when she first learned about hungry children in America, her thoughts quickly turned from \u201cHow can this happen?\u201d to \u201cI am going to help solve this!\u201d Bella and Kathleen both possess great compassion and integrity, and their desire to serve others is admirable. But they are not alone. These two young Mainers exemplify the tremendous capabilities of our youth. Communities across Maine and all of America are brimming with young people making a positive difference. I see it everywhere, and it continues to reaffirm my faith in our next generation of leaders."},

{"title": "ICYMI: New York Times Column Names Senator Collins as One of \u2018Four Senators to Watch in the Trump-Russia Investigation\u2019", "date": ["Posted Wed, 05/31/2017 - 08:22"], "release": "By: Carl Hulse WASHINGTON \u2014 They are a disparate foursome: the chamber\u2019s leading Republican centrist, a minister who embraces public service as a calling, a seasoned dealmaker and a high-profile presidential contender. These four Republican senators \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Marco Rubio of Florida \u2014 are emerging as a bloc integral to the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. The investigation is widely considered the premier inquiry, the one with the necessary jurisdiction and the best chance of producing a credible outcome. These four senators loom large as a crucial element in getting there. Despite early skepticism about the Republican-led panel\u2019s commitment to the investigation, the four have made it clear that they are determined to see it through to a conclusion that would satisfy the public and their colleagues in both parties. To get there, they will have to slog through thousands of pages of raw intelligence held by the C.I.A. and devote untold hours to grinding committee work behind closed doors. \u201cThis is not about the president, this is about the presidency,\u201d said Mr. Lankford, who was a longtime Baptist youth minister before he entered politics. \u201cThis is about where we are as a nation.\u201d This is not to say that other members of the panel aren\u2019t engaged. The committee\u2019s seven Democrats are certainly interested in finding out whether Russians colluded with the Trump campaign and helped to elect him. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the panel, has shown an increasing zeal for pursuing the question after an uncertain start. He and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, have forged a solid working relationship. Three other Republicans are also playing a role: John Cornyn of Texas, who as the No. 2 Senate Republican brings a leadership perspective to the investigation, Jim Risch of Idaho and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. But it is notable that the other four have quietly coalesced into something of an informal working group within the Intelligence Committee, pushing the investigation forward and consulting not only with each other and Mr. Burr, but also with Mr. Warner. \u201cWe are working very hard and we talk a lot with one another, as well,\u201d said Ms. Collins, who said the investigation would \u201ctake as long as required.\u201d \u201cThis is a complex investigation, and as you pull the threads, you find that it is connected to a whole lot of other threads in this tapestry that we are not yet seeing the whole of.\u201d Here is a look at the four and what is driving them: Although she is known as the Republican centrist voice in the Senate, another role she has held in Washington may be equally important in this case: senior Senate staff member. Ms. Collins was a top Senate aide and served in other executive posts before running for office. She is experienced in both conducting and overseeing inquiries. \u201cI really want to know the truth no matter who is implicated, no matter where the evidence leads,\u201d she said. As a 21-year-old in 1974, she was an intern for Representative William S. Cohen, a freshman Republican congressman from Maine who helped draw up the articles of impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. His colleagues say it would be a mistake to underestimate this junior member of the Senate. Mr. Lankford showed surprising political strength in a 2014 primary fight in a special Senate election in Oklahoma after compiling a conservative record and rapidly raising his profile during two terms in the House. He objected sharply to recent reports that the Senate inquiry was understaffed and moving at a plodding pace. \u201cIf you make a big staff, they get less access to the real documents for intelligence that you need,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to keep it with high-level folks in as small a pool as possible and give them the time they need,\u201d he said. Very few members of Congress make it into the leadership ranks; hardly anyone makes into leadership in the House and in the Senate. Mr. Blunt, the former House majority leader and a savvy inside player, is now the fifth-ranking Republican in the Senate. He has been adamant that Congress pursue the investigation into Russian meddling \u2014 both to find out what happened and to allow Congress and the White House to move beyond it. \u201cEveryone would benefit if we do this job in the right way and do it not faster than we can, but as fast we can,\u201d he said. Mr. Blunt has been a consistent voice that the committee must be thorough. \u201cWhen we are done, we need to have talked to everybody a reasonable person would think we should talk to and have seen everything a reasonable person would think we should see,\u201d he said. After his failed presidential bid, he almost didn\u2019t return to the Senate, but a change of heart has thrust him into the middle of an inquiry surrounding the election of his Republican primary race rival. In a recent appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Mr. Rubio suggested that committee work would not just lay out for the public what the Russians did, \u201cbut how they did it and what it means for the future and what we should be doing about it.\u201d A proponent of a hard line with Russia, Mr. Rubio dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint that he was the victim of a witch hunt. \u201cWe are nation of laws and we are going to follow those laws,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president is entitled to his opinion.\u201d There is no doubt that political conflict will erupt as the inquiry advances. These four senators will be crucial in determining whether it stays on track."},

The  would increase addiction treatment services to help combat the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic by modifying the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) Exclusion, an arcane policy created in 1965 that limits Medicaid coverage for substance abuse treatment to facilities with less than 16 beds. The  would lift this outdated barrier by expanding Medicaid coverage to pay for up to 40 treatment beds at larger substance abuse treatment facilities. Senators King and Durbin introduced a similiar bill last year. \u201cExpanding access to treatment facilities is critical to helping Maine people struggling with addiction.\u00a0 It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that an available bed at a treatment facility could mean the difference between life and death. In fact, one of the most tragic circumstances is when someone is ready to seek help and they\u2019re turned away because of a lack of resources,\u201d  .\u00a0 \u201cToday, outdated federal rules are limiting the availability of treatment and standing in the way of these potentially lifesaving opportunities.\u00a0 By increasing this decades-old cap, this legislation will allow treatment facilities to do what they do best \u2013 extend a helping hand to more people who are in need of it.\u201d \u201cOur nation\u2019s opioid and heroin epidemic has devastated countless families and communities across the country and has hit Maine particularly hard,\u201d  .\u00a0 \u201cAs we look for ways to address this burgeoning public health crisis, we must identify and correct outdated policies like the IMD exclusion that unintentionally block access to lifesaving substance abuse treatment.\u00a0 By improving access to treatment opportunities, our legislation will help provide hope and healing to those struggling with addiction.\u201d The IMD Exclusion prohibits the use of federal Medicaid funding for any care provided to patients 22-64 years old in residential mental health or substance abuse facilities larger than 16 beds.\u00a0 This policy was created over 50 years ago to discourage the mass warehousing of those with mental illness.\u00a0 But as understanding and treatment options for addiction have improved, this outdated rule continues to pose a barrier.\u00a0 It also violates substance use disorder treatment parity requirements by unfairly discriminating against Medicaid beneficiaries.\u00a0 This policy is no longer justified, and stakeholders, such as the Surgeon General and National Governors Association, agree that this policy poses a burden to care. The Medicaid CARE Act modifies the IMD Exclusion to allow Medicaid coverage for up to 40 beds in appropriately accredited \u201cresidential addiction treatment facilities\u201d for up to 60 consecutive days for adults with substance use disorders.\u00a0 The bill allows individuals receiving addiction treatment in such a facility to maintain Medicaid coverage for other medical services, which are currently ineligible under the IMD Exclusion. The legislation also establishes a new $50 million youth inpatient addiction treatment grant program to fund facilities that provide substance use disorder treatment services to underserved, at-risk Medicaid beneficiaries who are younger than age 21, with an emphasis on rural communities.\u00a0 In addition, the bill would increase flexibility for pregnant and postpartum women who are seeking treatment, and would allow them to access the services they need to ensure positive birth outcomes.\u00a0 This legislation builds off a bipartisan letter that Senators King, Durbin, Collins, Portman, Brown, Capito and 23 other Senators sent in August 2016 to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) pushing for greater flexibility on IMD Exclusion to expand access to treatment. U.S. Representative Bill Foster (D-Ill.) will be introducing the House companion version of this bill.

Neither site has been dredged in more than two decades, creating significant safety and navigational access concerns. In their letter, Senators Collins and King and Representative Pingree noted that Congress recently provided an additional $49 million to support the maintenance of small ports and harbors in the recently passed federal funding bill. They called on the Administration to use that funding to provide approximately $2 million to dredge York Harbor and $3.2 million to dredge the Saco River.

Washington, D.C. 20503 The Honorable Doug Lamont Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) U.S. Department of the Army 108 Army Pentagon Washington, D.C. 20310-0108 Dear Director Mulvaney and Mr. Lamont: We are writing in support of the urgent need for maintenance dredging of the York Harbor Federal Navigation Project (FNP) in York, Maine, and the Saco River FNP in Saco and Biddeford, Maine. As dredging of these areas is essential to address significant safety and navigational access concerns in the region, we urge you to allocate additional funding provided by Congress in fiscal year (FY) 2017 to the York and Saco small port and harbor projects. The recently enacted FY 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides funding for the Corps of Engineers\u2019 Civil Works program, including $49 million in additional operations and maintenance funding designated for small, remote, or subsistence navigation. This is funding designated by Congress to support our nation\u2019s small ports and harbors, which are the economic lifeblood for many coastal communities in Maine and throughout the country. Since York Harbor\u2019s last dredging in 1996, more than 42,000 cubic yards of sand, silt, and clay have accumulated, hindering navigational access and compromising vessel safety. The Town of York has spent more than four years performing the required environmental studies and securing the requisite permits. York Harbor is a significant participant in the lobster and fishing industry in the State of Maine, and the significant lowering of the water level in York Harbor threatens the economy and safety in the local area. We support providing approximately $2 million in FY17 funding to dredge York Harbor, which supports and preserves an annual direct economic benefit of $12 million. The Towns of Saco and Biddeford have also completed the permit process required for dredging of the Saco River, which has not received a maintenance dredging in over 24 years. The result of the neglect to the river is accumulation of more than 150,000 cubic yards of sand requiring removal. This dredged sediment would greatly assist in alleviating the on-going erosion at nearby Camp Ellis Beach, where to date 37 homes have been lost due to the erosion. We support providing approximately $3.2 million in FY17 funding to dredge the Saco River, which is home to more than 40 commercial fishing vessels and contributes more than $53 million in economic impact to the community each year. Both the York Harbor and Saco River FNP\u2019s are \u201cshovel ready,\u201d and completion of these projects would have a dramatic economic impact on the surrounding communities. To address these critical needs and maintain these essential water infrastructure projects in Maine, we urge you to prioritize funding in the Army Corps\u2019 FY17 work plan, consistent with all applicable laws and regulations.

Their bipartisan bill would authorize $15 million per year over the next five years for the Lifespan Respite Care program, which allows full-time caregivers to take a temporary break from their responsibilities caring for aging or disabled loved ones. \u201cFamily caregivers are an invaluable resource to our society, devoting enormous time and attention and making tremendous personal and financial sacrifices to care for their loved ones. This task, however, can take a toll. Caregivers experience higher rates of acute and chronic health conditions, and far too many caregivers don\u2019t receive the support they need in their caregiving role,\u201d   \u201cThat is why respite care, which provides caregivers with a temporary break from their responsibilities, is so essential.

This legislation will help ensure continued funding for the Lifespan Respite Care Program so that our family caregivers can access the support and relief they need.\u201d Respite care protects the health of caregivers, decreases the need for professional long-term care, and allows individuals who require care to remain at home. To date, 35 states have received funding through the Lifespan Respite Care program. The program provides competitive grants to states to establish or enhance statewide respite resources and help ensure that quality respite is available and accessible to all family caregivers.

{"title": "Maine Delegation Leads Letter Urging Administration to Authorize Funding for Delayed VA Medical Leases", "date": ["Posted Fri, 05/19/2017 - 17:18"], "release": "U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King and U.S. Representatives Chellie Pingree and Bruce Poliquin today sent a letter to the Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requesting that they include funding for 24 VA medical facility leases in the President\u2019s FY 2018 budget request. The letter also urges the administration to assume authorization of the leases and partner with members of Congress to raise awareness about the need for a permanent solution to the delays in authorizing VA major medical facility leases. Under law, the VA must receive specific legislative authorization to lease medical facilities with average annual rental payments in excess of $1 million. However, since 2012, Congress has not, through a regular process, authorized any major VA medical facility leases, hampering the ability of the department to provide much-needed health care and services to veterans around the country. The majority of these medical facilities \u2013 located in 15 states and serving an estimated 11 million veterans \u2013 have been awaiting Congressional approval for more than a year. \u201cMany of these leases will serve urgent needs in the veteran population for accessible, high-quality medical services,\u201d\u00a0 . \u201cIn numerous cases, the leases will greatly reduce veterans\u2019 commuting times for care or replace cramped and antiquated facilities with modern facilities that offer increased services, including expanded critical health care services.\u00a0 Some of the leases will consolidate multiple existing facilities, thereby reducing inefficiencies and simplifying veteran care.\u00a0 Finally, the facilities will address projected future growth in veteran demand for services.\u201d One reason for the delay in congressional authorization has been a recent change in the way that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scores the cost of VA\u2019s leases. Prior to 2012, the major medical facility leases only required an annual budgetary offset to fund each year of rent under the lease, but that year, CBO determined that the total cost of these leases, many of which cover a 20-year period, should be recorded entirely up front when the leases are initiated and the acquisition occurs. As such, any legislation authorizing these VA medical facilities leases requires full budgetary offsets covering the entire life of the lease, even though actual spending would not increase and the leases are ultimately subject to annual appropriations. The proposed VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in Portland would consolidate the existing Saco and Portland CBOCs and enhance VA outpatient services. The lease would increase veterans\u2019 access to a core set of services and additional specialty care in a state-of-the-art, energy efficient health care facility in the Portland-area. The planned full deployment of tele-medicine technologies in the new clinic would further improve veterans\u2019 access to care in rural locations throughout Maine. Congresswoman Pingree and Congressman Poliquin have also cosponsored a companion bill in the House.

A scorekeeping issue however, has prevented the Congressional authorizing committees from moving forward with these much-needed leases. We are writing to ask for your help in moving authorizing legislation to enactment.\u00a0 At stake is the health and quality of life for thousands of our nation\u2019s veterans.\u00a0 The 24 leases will support facilities around the country, in the following cities:\u00a0 Ann Arbor, Michigan Birmingham, Alabama Boston, Massachusetts Charleston, South Carolina Daytona Beach, Florida Denver, Colorado Gainesville, Florida Hampton Roads, Virginia Mission Bay, California Missoula, Montana Northern Colorado, Colorado Ocala, Florida Oxnard, California Pike County, Georgia Portland, Maine Raleigh, North Carolina Santa Rosa, California Corpus Christi, Texas Jacksonville, Florida, Pontiac, Michigan Rochester, New York Tampa, Florida Terre Haute, Indiana Many of these leases will serve urgent needs in the veteran population for accessible, high-quality medical services.\u00a0 In numerous cases, the leases will greatly reduce veterans\u2019 commuting times for care or replace cramped and antiquated facilities with modern facilities that offer increased services, including expanded critical health care services.\u00a0 Some of the leases will consolidate multiple existing facilities, thereby reducing inefficiencies and simplifying veteran care.\u00a0 Finally, the facilities will address projected future growth in veteran demand for services. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The President\u2019s FY 2018 Budget Blueprint (\u201cBlueprint\u201d) proposes to increase the VA\u2019s discretionary funding levels by six percent.\u00a0 The Blueprint states that this funding will be used \u201cto improve patient access and timeliness of medical care services\u201d and to \u201cenable the Department to provide a broad range of primary care, specialized care, and related medical and social support services to enrolled veterans, including services that are uniquely related to veterans\u2019 health and special needs.\u201d The 24 leases authorized by our legislation would go a long way to achieving both of those goals.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We therefore ask for your assistance in moving toward completing projects that are critical to providing access to health care for veterans, often in rural communities.\u00a0 Specifically, we ask that the President\u2019s FY 2018 budget request assume authorization of, and fund, the 24 leases, and that the Administration send language to Congress that, if enacted, will authorize and fund the leases.\u00a0 We are confident that these actions will demonstrate the Administration\u2019s support for the leases, and the veteran populations they are meant to serve, and will help advance authorization of the leases in Congress.\u00a0 We also ask that you partner with us in raising awareness about the need to bring about a permanent solution to the delays in authorizing VA major medical facility leases. Specifically, we would ask that you reach out to each of the Congressional offices that has a currently pending lease to ensure they are aware of the issue affecting veterans in their states and encourage them to work with us and Senate and House VA Committees to seek a permanent solution to the problem. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We appreciate your consideration of this request and look forward to working with you to ensure that veterans have access to the timely, high-quality health care they have earned through their service to this country.\u00a0 \u00a0"},

At Senator Collins\u2019 invitation, Meg Callaway, the project director of the Piscataquis Thriving in Place Collaborative at the Charlotte White Center in Dover-Foxcroft, testified. \u201cIsolation and loneliness can have serious, even deadly, consequences for the health and well-being of our nation\u2019s seniors. Our hearing looked at some of the solutions that will help build a strong sense of community, therefore leading to healthier, happier lives for older Americans,\u201d   \u201cInitiatives to create age-friendly communities have grown organically across the country in response to local needs, and I am proud that dozens of towns across Maine are leading the way.\u201d During the hearing, Ms. Callaway spoke about some of the projects her organization leads that serve the residents of Piscataquis County, which is one of Maine\u2019s most rural counties and has the second-oldest population. She noted that renovations are currently underway of an historic building that will house a senior center for independent older adults and an adult day services program for seniors needing greater support. Senator Collins asked Ms. Callaway to elaborate on her vision for the new center. \u201cThe one most critical resource for caregivers is respite. A few hours to take care of one\u2019s own needs with all the burden of care that families are carrying is absolutely critical,\u201d   \u201cWhat we are hoping to provide at the adult day services center is full medical care\u2026that will free the caregivers up to participate in some of the programming through the senior center for independent adults.\u201d \u201cThat sounds just wonderful. What a great gift to the community that would be on so many fronts,\u201d   \u201cI\u2019ve seen senior centers in communities in Maine make such a difference in getting people out of their homes to socialize and enjoy one another\u2019s company. Your concept of combining [a senior center for independent older adults and an adult day services program] is really innovative and needed.\u201d While seniors prefer to age at home, aging in place poses a number of challenges like home maintenance, mobility and transportation, and access to programs and services. The number of Americans age 65 and older is projected to double by 2060, and improvements to infrastructure and opportunities for our aging population will be needed to respond to this unprecedented demographic shift. Maine actually leads the nation in developing age-friendly communities. Of the 163 communities in the AARP Network of Age-Friendly Communities nationwide, 35 are in Maine. In addition to Ms. Callaway, the committee heard from three other program directors, who described initiatives in both rural and urban settings that focus on transportation, housing, social engagement, technology, outdoor space and buildings, as well as informational campaigns and cultural efforts to create a positive experience for our aging population and individuals with disabilities.

Senator Collins, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, championed the effort to ensure the Fishing Safety Training Grant Program and the Fishing Safety Research Grant Program receive funding. For the first time, these competitive grants will expand access to training resources for fishermen in Maine and other coastal states as well as support research on technologies and tools that will enhance safety. Last year, Senator Collins led a bipartisan letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, urging them to provide $3 million each for the Fishing Safety Training Grant Program and the Fishing Safety Research Grant Program. Established under the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010, these programs will help provide members of the fishing industry with safety and survival training. In her letter to the Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Collins noted the importance of fully funding these programs to help vessel operators comply with new safety requirements and protect commercial fishermen. In addition to preserving countless lives, these safety programs will save taxpayers money by avoiding the need for costly search and rescue operations. \u201cSafety and survival training is of the utmost importance to fishermen, who work in the deadliest occupation in America,\u201d   \u201cI am pleased that these lifesaving and cost-effective programs for which I strongly advocated have been fully funded.

Approximately 2.6 million children are currently being raised in grandfamilies, and experts say this number is rising as the opioid epidemic continues to devastate families and communities across the country. The legislation follows a March Aging Committee hearing where the members heard from grandparents who are raising grandchildren when parents are struggling with addiction or are no longer able to care for their children.

Public Law-114-266, signed December 14th, 2016, requires this strategy be submitted to Congress by June 12, 2017. The law requires the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence to jointly develop and submit to Congress a five-year anti-Boko Haram strategy within 180 days of its enactment. This strategy should include plans to assist the Nigerian government, the Multinational Joint Task Force, and international partners to counter the regional threat posed by Boko Haram, enhance Nigeria\u2019s capacity to provide safe and secure schools, provide humanitarian support, and strengthen and promote the rule of law and human rights. It has been more than three years since the terrorist group, Boko Haram, kidnapped 276 Nigerian schoolgirls from the Government Secondary School in the town of Chibok. Since that day, the Chibok schoolgirls have been held in captivity by this terrorist organization, which prides itself on abducting, burning, raping and butchering innocent people. In response to the kidnapping and growing atrocities committed by Boko Haram, Congress unanimously passed bipartisan legislation sponsored by Senator Susan Collins and Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson and cosponsored by the signers of this letter, S. 1632/H.R. 3833, which became Public Law-114-266. While we were encouraged by the release of 82 of the Chibok schoolgirls last week, it is imperative that we remember that many of the girls remain in captivity along with untold hundreds of other women, men, and children who have been kidnapped by Boko Haram. As we approach June 12, the 180-day deadline set by Public Law-114-266, we look forward to receiving an update on your efforts to develop an anti-Boko Haram strategy and beginning the process of dismantling Boko Haram and reuniting all of the Chibok schoolgirls with their families. Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter."},

The RAISE Act would direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop and sustain a national strategy to recognize and support the more than 40 million family caregivers in the United States. This bipartisan legislation has been endorsed by 58 aging and disability organizations, including the AARP, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, the Michael J. Fox Foundation and the Arc.

The VA purchases health care services from non-VA community providers to help veterans receive timely and accessible care, yet delays in processing claims have been a persistent problem. In a May 2016 report, the Government Accountability office found that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) only processed 66 percent of claims within 30 days. During the hearing, Senator Collins pointed out to Dr. Baligh Yehia, the VHA Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Community Care, that these delays create a serious issue for providers in Maine, from rural providers to larger networks like Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems (EMHS). \u201c[The prompt payment of VA claims] continues to be a problem not only in my state but others as well.

Dr. David Shulkin, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and Dr. Baligh Yehia, the VHA Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Community Care, testified at the hearing. Beginning in 2011, the Access Received Closer to Home (ARCH) pilot program allowed northern Maine veterans to receive health care services at Cary Medical Center in Caribou, negating the need for these veterans to travel up to 600 miles roundtrip to the Togus VA Hospital in Augusta. Prior to the ARCH program\u2019s expiration in 2016, Senator Collins strongly advocated for the continuation of similar access to community care and invited Dr. Shulkin and Dr. Yehia to Cary Medical Center last year so that they could see this highly successful program firsthand. Following Dr. Shulkin and Dr. Yehia\u2019s visit, the VA began authorizing provider agreements that allowed northern Maine veterans to continue receiving health care services at Cary Medical Center and other providers in a manner very similar to the ARCH program. Senator Collins thanked Secretary Shulkin and Under Secretary Yehia for keeping their word to preserve seamless community care and asked them to commit to providing these services moving forward.  \u201cAs Congress and your department work to reform and consolidate VA's community care authorities, will you pledge to continue to ensure that veterans in northern Maine experience another seamless transition and continue to enjoy the convenient, efficient, and cost-effective community care that they are receiving now?\u201d \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d   \u201cARCH has really been a learning lesson for us and our pilots that we have today in the Choice Program in North Dakota and Alaska are modeled after ARCH...

We strongly encourage you to heed this explicit direction from Congress. While we appreciate your decision to issue a new Department-wide policy that prevents program offices from rejecting future grant applications based on simple formatting issues, that does not solve the current problem. You are right to observe that needless red tape should not interfere with helping students. That very red tape currently threatens the futures of thousands of low-income high school students, many of whom would be the first in their families to attend college. We urge you to use all of the discretion at your disposal to reverse expeditiously the decision to reject applications for the FY 2017 Upward Bound competition based on minor formatting issues and to provide flexibility to applicants. If this decision is not reversed, the Department risks, over the next five years, denying thousands of disadvantaged high school students the promise of a higher education. Sincerely,"},

Republicans were set to blow up a historic Senate rule so they could bust through a Democratic blockade and confirm Neil Gorsuch for the US Supreme Court with just a majority vote. \u201cRather than the usual milling around at vote time, when senators from both parties mix it up with slaps on the back and chitchat, many members began the series of votes on this April morning sitting quietly at their desks. Republicans on one side, Democrats on the other. \u201cWhich is why Sen. Susan Collins stood out. Carrying a bright green folder, the Republican from Maine crisscrossed the chamber floor, quietly approaching her colleagues \u2013 placing her hand on a shoulder, bending down to whisper, then opening her folder.  The petition sought to preserve the chamber\u2019s last supermajority threshold \u2013 not for court appointments but for passing legislation itself.  In this increasingly polarized era, Collins is a crucial swing vote in a chamber where Republicans hold only a tenuous 52-to-48 majority, putting her in a position to help shape or stall the legislative agenda of President Trump\u2026 \u201cCollins is a fifth-generation public servant who draws inspiration from Maine\u2019s first female US senator, Margaret Chase Smith, and from her political lineage. Both her parents served as mayor of her hometown of Caribou, on the northeastern tip of Maine, where her family runs a lumber business that dates back to 1844. \u201cThe state has a tradition of sending independent-minded senators to Washington, and the moderate Republican carries on that tradition. It\u2019s what makes her one of the most wooed members of the chamber. \u201c\u2018Not a day goes by that I do not hear from a colleague in the Senate, asking me to either join in an initiative, or what I will do on a particular issue,\u2019 she says in an interview. \u2018That\u2019s very nice in some ways, but it puts a lot of pressure on me,\u2019 especially now that the president is a member of her own party, she explains. \u201cThough she did not vote for Mr. Trump in November, she stood with him on the Gorsuch nomination after having tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to broker a bipartisan truce to avoid the explosive rules change. But she did not support Trump\u2019s choice for Education secretary, Betsy DeVos. \u201cCollins says the president called her about the bill. He found it intriguing and sent White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and an assistant to talk to her and Senator Cassidy about the specifics. \u201cIn the end, though, the administration backed the House version. It aimed to pass it through a special budget maneuver that requires only a majority vote in each chamber.  She prefers the committee process, hearings, and amendments in which the House and Senate have a chance to work their will and come to some kind of bipartisan solution. \u201cThe GOP leadership in the Senate has meanwhile set up a working group of 13 Republicans to fashion the Senate's own Republican health-care bill. Neither Cassidy nor Collins is on it \u2013 and notably, no women either.

The Firefighters Retention Act of 2017 will give fire departments flexibility to use Staffing for Adequate Fire & Emergency Response (SAFER) Grants to transition part-time or paid-on-call personnel to full-time status. Under current law, fire departments can only use SAFER grants to hire and train new personnel and are prohibited from using these grants to promote part-time firefighters, who are already trained and equipped to respond to emergencies. \u201cVolunteer and part-time firefighters provide a vital service to municipalities across Maine and the country,\u201d   \u201cUnfortunately, when these experienced, highly-trained individuals wish to become full-time firefighters, fire departments are prohibited from using certain federal funds to promote them. Our cost-effective legislation removes this unnecessary restriction so that these brave men and women can continue to serve their fellow citizens and fire departments have the resources necessary to keep their communities safe.\u201d \u201cPart-time firefighters serve on the frontlines of their communities and have the experience to effectively and efficiently respond when emergency strikes,\u201d   \u201cThis commonsense legislation would give fire departments greater ability to promote trained, experienced firefighters, which will save money and reaffirm the critical role these men and women play in keeping our neighborhoods safe.\u201d \u201cHere in Maine, it is increasingly difficult to find individuals willing and able to answer the call to fight fires within their communities,\u201d   \u201cThis critical shortage puts lives and property at greater risk. By giving fire departments additional tools to recruit full-time firefighters, the Firefighters Retention Act will help towns effectively deliver fire and safety services.\u201d In fiscal year 2015, a total of $340 million was awarded to fire departments across the country through the SAFER grant program. The SAFER grant program provides direct funding to fire departments and volunteer firefighter organizations to help them increase or maintain the number of trained firefighters available in their communities. The majority of organized fire departments recruit resident and community leaders who are familiar with their neighborhoods to be part-time or volunteer firefighters - comprising 70% of the total firefighting force in the United States. These firefighters receive critical training and certifications, including fire officer, pump operator or engineer, extrication, and hazardous materials training. In addition to providing flexibility to support part-time personnel, the Firefighters Retention Act of 2017 would also save money for fire departments and taxpayers alike by allowing fire departments to direct their resources toward firefighters who are already trained rather than devoting greater resources to recruiting and training new firefighters. The Firefighters Retention Act of 2017 has been endorsed by the International Association of Firefighters, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National Association of Counties, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors, among other groups."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cTHIS WEEK\u201d May 7, 2017 STEPHANOPOULOS: President Trump is up and tweeting this morning. Just out a few moments ago, he said, \"Republican senators will not let the American people down. Obamacare premiums and deductibles are way up. It was a lie and it is dead.\" We are joined now by one of those Republican senators, Senator Susan Collins from Maine. Senator, thank you for joining us this morning. We just heard the president right there. You heard Speaker Ryan as well. But you had serious concerns. You were against the original House bill. Is it fair to say you're against the amended one? SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: I have a lot of concerns. It's difficult to assess the new House bill because we still don't have a CBO analysis of the impact on coverage and costs. And those are key questions. STEPHANOPOULOS: Those are the key questions. I mean, we heard Dr. Gawande weigh in on that, as well. But you heard Speaker Ryan right there. He says he's going to take care of those older, rural Americans who don't have the tax credits, who are going to lose their subsidies under Obamacare. He cited your state of Maine several times. COLLINS: Well, first of all, one of the problems with the House bill is that the tax credits are not adjusted for income or geographic region. That really hurts a state like Maine, where we have an older population living in largely more expensive, rural areas, as far as health care is concerned. I've heard a lot of talk about the Maine high-risk pool. And indeed, it was a success in Maine for the 18 months or so in which it operated before the passage of the ACA and it can be part of the solution. But in Maine, we had definite revenue streams supporting the high-risk pool, and that is why it worked. In the House bill, it's really up to the states to come up with whatever option they wish. So that could work and it could be part of a solution. But the devil really is in the details. STEPHANOPOULOS: So do you agree with Speaker Ryan and President Trump who are saying people with preeexisting conditions are going have the same coverage they have now, even better, Speaker Ryan said, in some cases, letters of protection, than under Obamacare? COLLINS: I think that's unlikely, but so much discretion is given to the states without any guardrails. The difference between that approach and the approach in the bill that Senator Cassidy and I have introduced is we keep the ACA safeguards, the consumer protections, for people with preexisting conditions. It's true that under the House bill that a state that gets a waiver would still have to provide coverage to people with preexisting conditions, but that coverage might well be unaffordable. And if the coverage is unaffordable, that doesn't do any good for a child who has juvenile diabetes and is going have that her entire life. And once she's no longer on her parents' policy, that's going to create problems in some states. STEPHANOPOULOS: If the House bill were before you today, would you be a yes? COLLINS: Well, first of all, the House bill is not going to come before us. The Senate is starting from scratch. We're going to draft our own bill, and I'm convinced that we're going to take the time to do it right. Speaker Ryan today said that he hoped that the Senate would improve the House bill. I think we will do so and that we will come up with a whole new fresh approach that solves the legitimate flaws that do exist with the ACA, where we\u2019ve seen, in some markets, insurers fleeing so people won't be able to buy subsidized insurance, but it will also keep some of the benefits of the ACA. My goal is to actually expand coverage for those 28 million Americans who still lack coverage today despite the ACA. STEPHANOPOULOS: A lot of people are struck by the working group that's been put together in the Senate to deal with healthcare. I'm going to put the picture up right there. There you see it right there -- 13 men. Not a single woman. Cecile Richards from Planned Parenthood tweeted about that. \"When women aren't at the table, we're on the menu.\" Senator Patty Murray, Democratic senator of course: \"It matters to have women at the table and it matters when they aren't.\" Why aren't you on that working group? COLLINS: Well, the leaders obviously chose the people they want, but I'm working hard with Senator Cassidy, with our co-sponsors--Senator Mike Rounds, Shelley Moore Capito, Johnny Isakson--We're reaching out to moderate Democrats. I would like to see us put together a bipartisan group to solve this problem, of Democrats who acknowledge that there are problems with the current law, that it is not working well in several states, and Republicans who also want to make sure that we're not reducing coverage and we're giving flexibility. There's an issue that no one is talking about in Washington that's so critical. And that is, if we're going reduce the cost of health insurance, we have to take steps to reduce the costs of health care. And no one's talking about that. Senator Cassidy and I have in our bill a transparency section so that you would actually know what you're paying, and I think that would help consumers make better choices. STEPHANOPOULOS: Final question, can you support a final bill that denies Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood? COLLINS: That is an important issue to me, because I don't think that low-income women should be denied their choice of health care providers, for family planning, cancer screenings, for well women care. It's not the only issue in this huge bill, but I certainly think it's not fair and it is a mistake to defund Planned Parenthood. It's one of many issues. STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Collins, thanks for your time this morning. COLLINS: Thank you, George."},

This $2 billion increase builds on last year\u2019s $2 billion increase, which represented the largest funding boost the NIH had received in more than a decade. The agreement also includes additional priorities championed by U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee and the Chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee. \u201cI have long worked to secure significant investments for biomedical research that will help us conquer so many devastating diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer\u2019s\u2014our nation\u2019s most costly disease. This $2 billion increase in funding for the NIH, including $400 million for Alzheimer\u2019s, will spur important research that is already underway to develop treatments, means of prevention, and cures for diseases that affect nearly every American family. \u201cThis budget agreement also includes funding for proven economic development and job creation programs that I have long championed such as TIGER grants, which have provided Maine with $122 million to rebuild bridges, highways, and other vital infrastructure projects across the state, and the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, which has helped a number of Maine communities improve their downtowns and expand economic opportunities. The agreement makes investments in our young people by reinstating year-round Pell Grants; supporting the TRIO program, and investing in initiatives to reduce youth homelessness. \u201cThe budget deal is also great news for the hardworking men and women at BIW. In addition to providing greater long-term certainty, this legislation includes an additional $433 million I worked hard to secure for the construction of an additional Arleigh Burke class destroyer (DDG-51) that is likely to be awarded to BIW. \u201cFinally, the agreement includes a provision providing much needed relief to the cap on H-2B visas, which are heavily relied upon by Maine\u2019s tourism and hospitality businesses that are in need of seasonal, temporary workers beyond the number that they can hire in our state and region.

The Procurement Fraud Prevention Act would require small businesses to be notified that free assistance is available for help in procuring federal contracts through federal programs, including Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTACs), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA). Many business owners are unaware these resources exist and fall victim to scams that mislead them into paying high sums of money for contract procurement assistance. \u201cThe goods and services provided by the private sector are critically important to the federal government\u2019s operations,\u201d   \u201cUnfortunately, the procurement process can be complex and difficult to navigate, which can deter small businesses from competing for contracts or lead them to hire unnecessary and expensive consultants.

Unfortunately, bad actors disguised as vendors or government officials obtain businesses\u2019 contact from this public database and email business owners directly after they have registered asking for high sums of money in return for registration and contracting assistance. Some scammers even impersonate government officials in order to mislead businesses into paying for these services. As a result, many small businesses unwittingly sign up for services they were not seeking at the cost of hundreds or thousands of dollars. While various firms provide legitimate contracting assistance, bad actors intentionally use predatory tactics to drain money from small businesses. The Procurement Fraud Prevention Act requires GSA and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to ensure that any direct communication to a small business about its registration in a procurement system, including SAM, contains information about cost-free federal procurement technical assistance services available through PTACs, SBA, MBDA, and other programs. These services are readily available through federal, local, and private investment to help small businesses succeed. PTACs across the country regularly report small businesses coming to them after these fraudulent encounters, seeking corrective action, with some PTACs reporting up to 10 fraudulent solicitations per week. Michigan is home to 10 PTACs and over 850,000 small businesses that account for half of the state\u2019s private workforce."},

Federal funds provided by the State Veterans\u2019 Home Construction Grant Program allow states to make critical facility upgrades or construct new facilities to serve aging veteran populations.

Continued federal support for VA State Homes will build on the success of these facilities in serving the long-term care needs of our country\u2019s veterans. State Veterans Homes have a long history of helping ensure that veterans disabled by age, illness, or other conditions continue to receive the respect and dignity they have earned through their service. Operated by state governments, these facilities play important roles in the effort to address the unique health and quality of life needs of each state\u2019s veteran population. The VA partners with certified state homes to provide nursing home, domiciliary, and adult day care services to critical segments of the veteran population with continuing or special medical needs, including thousands of elderly veterans. Federal funds made available through the VA State Home Construction Grant Program allow states to make critical renovations and upgrades to existing facilities and construct new facilities to serve the aging veteran population. These grant opportunities are important to ensure that each State Veterans Home facility continues to meet VA\u2019s standards and delivers the highest caliber of care to veterans. The growing backlog of more than 100 construction and renovation projects across the country, the majority of which have already secured matching state appropriations, presents challenges to meeting the long-term care needs of these veterans, particularly in rural states or states lacking alternate VA-certified facilities. We recognize the difficult budgetary decisions that the Subcommittee is facing. However, we want to underscore that robust funding for the VA State Home Construction Grant Program will allow State Homes to continue to provide high-quality care for our country\u2019s elderly veterans and veterans with long-term medical needs.

The Senators also want to know what steps are being taken now to help American truck drivers who may be unseated from their jobs adapt and retrain. Technology has made America\u2019s manufacturing sector more productive than ever before, but millions of blue-collar manufacturing jobs have been lost to automation.

HHS\u2019s proposal for the most recent National Survey of Older Americans Act Participants and the Centers for Independent Living Annual Program Performance Report deleted questions on sexual orientation and gender identity. In the letter, the senators expressed concern that HHS falsely stated that the National Survey of Older Americans Act Participants remained unchanged from last year. Removing sexual orientation and gender identity questions from the surveys would limit HHS\u2019s ability to address challenges facing the LGBT community. Older LGBT adults and LGBT persons with disabilities face challenges including financial insecurity, social isolation, discrimination, and barriers to access for aging and accessibility services.  the senators wrote.  HHS is currently accepting public comments on the proposed surveys, Centers for Independent Living Annual Program Performance Report until May 5, and National Survey of Older Americans Act Participants until May 12. The senators have requested a briefing from HHS on the decision to delete sexual orientation and gender identity questions on these surveys. The Older Americans Act provides funding for services such as home-delivered meals, transportation, home care, and caregiver support in addition to programs designed to serve people with disabilities including skills training and counseling. The Centers for Independent Living provide resources to ensure that people with disabilities can live independently in their homes and communities.

The signed letter can be found  . The full text is below. +++ April 28, 2017 The Honorable Betsy DeVos Secretary United States Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W. Washington, D.C. 20202-8510 Dear Secretary DeVos: We are writing to request your urgent attention to applications deemed ineligible for the fiscal year (FY) 2017 Upward Bound Program competition due to minor formatting concerns and to request that the Department of Education reverse its rejection of these applications. Absent such a reversal, thousands of low-income and first-generation students could be denied a chance to access higher education because of inadvertent formatting issues. On October 17, 2016, the Department published in the Federal Register a Notice Inviting Applications for New Awards (Notice) for the FY 2017 Upward Bound Program competition. The Notice includes arbitrary formatting criteria not mandated by Congress. The criteria are not related to the substance of the Upward Bound applications and do not provide any form of recourse for applicants to correct minor, unintentional deviations from these criteria. The criteria are also inconsistent with other TRIO competitions. For example, the Notice for the FY 2017 competition required that applications be double-spaced, whereas the Department\u2019s FY 2015 Notice for the Student Support Services Program required double spacing for narrative text only and single spacing for figures, charts, and graphs. The FY 2017 Notice for the McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program competition includes formatting instructions similar to the Upward Bound Notice, but does not say that applications will be rejected if these standards are not met. Many applicants regularly apply for other competitive grants from the Department, and such inconsistent guidelines are both confusing and unhelpful. While we are sensitive to the Department\u2019s need to provide application guidelines, the decision to exclude applications from consideration due to minor, non-substantive concerns is a clear example of the harm that results from inflexible, bureaucratic procedures. We understand that FY 2017 Upward Bound applications from as many as 17 states, plus Puerto Rico, have been rejected on the basis of formatting. At least one applicant was rejected because the line spacing in two info-graphics included text that was 1.5 spaced instead of double spaced. Line spacing and font sizes can also result from automatic adjustments made by computer programs, such as those affecting spacing on spreadsheet tables. Other applicants have exceeded the page limit by mere sentences, an irregularity that can occur when converting applications into PDF format. In some instances, the errors were so slight that the applicants could not identify them on their own. Simply granting applicants the opportunity to address these arbitrary formatting requirements could prevent these absurd results. Focusing on formatting technicalities and administrative ease rather than the merits of these applications undermines the efficacy of this important program. Many applicants that were rejected have served generations of first-time, low-income students successfully for decades. Moreover, this year\u2019s re-applicants would be seriously disadvantaged in future years because they stand to lose critical prior experience points which they have earned. Arbitrary formatting requirements should not jeopardize the long-standing successes of these programs. The Department of Education should be supporting successful partnerships, not constructing bureaucratic roadblocks in administering Upward Bound and other TRIO programs. On behalf of thousands of college-bound students across the country, we ask that you read and score these applications so that they can be considered for funding during the FY 2017 competition. We look forward to working with you to break down the barriers facing our neediest students and to promote greater college accessibility and success. We would appreciate your prompt attention to this request. Sincerely,"},

{"title": "ICYMI: Senators Collins and King on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press", "date": ["Posted Sun, 04/30/2017 - 11:07"], "release": "\u00a0Maine\u2019s U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King appeared in a joint interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press today with host Chuck Todd. The Senators discussed their work to build consensus and facilitate bipartisanship in Washington, D.C. Click   to watch the interview. \u00a0A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cMEET THE PRESS\u201d APRIL 30, 2017 TODD: We have joining us this morning two Senators who could theoretically buck that trend: Republican Susan Collins, who is among the most bipartisan members of the Senate, and Angus King, just one of two Senate independents. He does caucus with the Democrats. Both happen to be from Maine, and they join me now to discuss if both sides can ever get along. Welcome to both of you. COLLINS: Thank you. TODD: Look it\u2019s going to be Pollyannaish, and you guys are going to say the right things about bipartisanship, but let me ask you this: What are the hurdles to bringing common ground back to a case where a politician might see it as a reward, not as a duty that the voters will punish? Senator Collins, you first. COLLINS: There are two big hurdles: One is the rise of ideological driven groups, on both the left and the right, who are requiring 100 percent compliance with 100 percent of their views 100 percent of the time. And the threat for members is that if they don\u2019t comply, they will face a well-funded primary opponent. The second factor is that the polarization in Washington, in many ways, reflects the divisions in our country. More and more, people are living with people who have the same views that they do. They are accessing news outlets that reinforce what they already think. We are seeing a growing intolerance on campuses for alterative viewpoints. All of that combines to produce the divisions in our country that I think Washington reflects. TODD: That was a pretty good answer, Senator King, what would you add? KING: Those are on my list, but here\u2019s one that is sort of odd: the Senate schedule. We leave on Thursday night, come back Monday morning. No one lives here anymore. When I worked here 40 years ago in the Senate, everyone lived here, their family was here. People literally don\u2019t get to know each other, and that\u2019s the problem. You don\u2019t have relationships. Here\u2019s another piece that I think might surprise you: Over 65 of the current senators have been there 10 years or less, and that means they don\u2019t know how to win. We are like a football time that\u2019s lost every game for five years. There\u2019s not a culture of success. Something doesn\u2019t work, you don\u2019t get the votes, you move on and you don\u2019t go back and try to make it work. TODD: You know, in fact, Senator Collins you were asked about the idea that you might run for governor and you thought about it, but you even said you know if you do that you actually are vacating an important role here, is it because of that lack of experience that\u2019s here that Senator King is referring to? COLLINS: It is, and if you looked at the way the Senate used to be, bipartisanship was always difficult \u2013 TODD: Right, let\u2019s not pretend it happened all the time- COLLINS: Right, it wasn\u2019t easy, but people were much more willing to sit down, negotiate and try to find common ground. I\u2019ve been part of several of those issues over the years, and I worry that the shrinking center in the Senate is making that more and more difficult. We saw that just recently that there is a profound lack of trust between the two parties that makes those negotiations hard. TODD: Here\u2019s what I don\u2019t get here, Senator King, with all due respect to essentially, I\u2019ll say, 95 percent of the U.S. Senate, which is if I talk to any of them individually, they all lament this issue. Is this a leadership-driven problem? Is it that the leadership, because they\u2019re being held to an electoral and political standard they cannot even allow bipartisanship to happen? KING: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the personalities of the leaders, but I think you\u2019re on to something in the sense that the pressures on the leaders to be partisans first is very intense. Chuck Schumer is in a difficult place, any time he makes a move--in fact, at the beginning of this session, he talked about, you know, we are going to work with the president when it\u2019s necessary and when we believe he\u2019s right. Huge reaction from the Democratic base [saying] you can\u2019t, you gotta resist, you can\u2019t compromise. As Senator Collins said, there are these outside groups that are constantly putting pressure on you to be purer than the driven snow. TODD: By the way, the State of Maine was brought up by the Vice President today. I\u2019m sure your ears perked up. And I thanked the Vice President for the great segue on health care. We were talking about this issue of preexisting conditions, I want to get into the details. You have your own bill in the Senate that may be the vehicle here for repealing or repairing, whatever you want to call the health care bill. But is he right in his description of these Maine risk pools that they somehow do protect those with preexisting conditions and keep costs down? COLLINS: Maine, for two years, had what was known as an invisible high-risk pool, and people with preexisting conditions did not even realize that they were part of it. It was financed by an assessment on all the health care policies that were sold in the state- KING: Which was an important part of how it worked. COLLINS: It is. But what was important was that after an individual\u2019s expenses reached a certain amount the high-risk pool picked that up, and it did work well for 2 years and had a 5 million dollar surplus when it ended. But the Affordable Care Act ended it. TODD: Would you be able to support something like that? KING: It\u2019s all in the details, because what is being proposed doesn\u2019t have the subsidy, for example, to make the Maine high risk pool successful. And there are a lot of people in Maine who argue that there were limitations, that a lot of the coverages were dropped, and that expenses for older people, over 60 for example, went way up. We got to look for what happened in the states; it\u2019s worth looking at, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a panacea, and I don\u2019t think it necessarily is an easy answer to the dilemma of preexisting conditions. TODD: I can\u2019t let you go without asking about your governor, Paul LePage, and the similarities, he called himself Trump before Trump. What have the two of you learned from the fact that Paul LePage found success in the same state that elected an independent and a very moderate Republican, and what have you learned from Trump that you both need to get better at? COLLINS: Well President Trump spoke very clearly to those people in Maine, particularly in the northern part of the state, who had lost their jobs; in part due to poorly negotiated trade agreements, and he\u2019s right about that. And if you are a displaced mill worker in Maine, you feel pretty left out. And he spoke to that group, he spoke compellingly to them, and I think that\u2019s something that we all need to do better on. Trade agreements often result in lower prices for consumers overall, but if you are without a paycheck, you don\u2019t really care about that. TODD: Senator King what have you learned from the success of a LePage and a Trump? KING: What you learn is to listen. I remember everybody thought Hilary was going to win, and the day before, and I remember saying, if and when she wins, she has got to do some serious listening to the people who voted for Donald Trump. The same thing goes in Maine; it goes across the country. Now, turning that around, I was disappointed in the president\u2019s speech last night because he is still in campaign mode talking strictly to his people. There are a lot of people who are disappointed or angry or whatever\u2014they have reason to. I think we need a little quiet what I call \u201celoquent listening\u201d in order to understand. The people, who voted for Trump and Paul LePage have absolutely legitimate concerns, and they need to be responded to. By the same token, the people who are concerned about the Trump policies, they need to be listened to. too. They have legitimate concerns. The country is divided in half. TODD: Senators King and Collins, this was great. Hopefully your other colleagues will say, \u201cHey, maybe folks from both sides of the aisle should appear together.\u201d Thank you."},

{"title": "Tax Fairness for Small Businesses: Supporting Our Nation\u2019s Job Creators", "date": ["Posted Mon, 04/24/2017 - 10:43"], "release": "Small businesses are our nation\u2019s job creators. According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses employ more than half of all American workers and have generated two-out-of-three net new jobs since the 1970s. Maine truly is a small business state, with nearly 300,000 of our residents employed by our more than 141,000 small businesses. That\u2019s nearly 60 percent of our workforce. Small businesses also make a great contribution to the American economy, generating half of our nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product of more than $18 trillion. They also account for 54 percent of all U.S. sales, 41 percent of private sector payroll, and one-third of our nation\u2019s export value. Their success is critical to the health of our economy. Unfortunately, our nation\u2019s small businesses shoulder an unfairly heavy tax burden that can affect their ability to compete with large firms in the marketplace. A recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), America\u2019s leading small-business association, found that concerns about federal taxes on business income ranked high on the list of the top problems facing small business owners. The reason for the unfairness is that, in many cases, the profits small businesses earn are taxed at a higher rate than the profits of larger corporations. Most of our nation\u2019s small businesses are organized as pass-throughs, meaning that their profits are passed on to their owners and reported on individual tax returns as ordinary income at the end of every tax year. As a result, small business income is subject to taxation at individual rates, which can be as high as 39.6 percent at the federal level and can exceed 50 percent in some states. In contrast, the highest federal corporate tax rate is 35 percent. If we want our small businesses to grow and create more jobs, we must reduce these high marginal rates. I believe Congress should undertake comprehensive tax reform to make our tax code simpler, fairer, and more pro-growth. And, as we do so, we must make sure American businesses of every size are given the opportunity to compete on a level playing field. Aligning the tax rate for pass-throughs with our corporate tax rate will ensure that Main Street remains competitive. That is why, along with Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, I have introduced the bipartisan Main Street Fairness Act, which will link the tax rates of pass-through entities and large corporations to ensure that small businesses never pay a higher tax rate than large companies. The Main Street Fairness Act has been endorsed by the NFIB and the National Association of Manufacturers. As a former Regional Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration, I know the importance of local businesses as the engines of economic growth. They sustain our communities and create good jobs. Small-business owners are our friends and neighbors, and they are among the most generous supporters of civic groups, local charities, youth sports, schools and virtually every other form of community activity. As I travel throughout Maine, I see again and again the role innovative small businesses play in revitalizing our downtowns with shops, restaurants, and small manufacturing operations. The energy, ingenuity, and perseverance of small business entrepreneurs must be supported with tax policies that are fair. The tax change Sen. Nelson and I propose will help make sure that small businesses remain healthy, strong, and growing, so that they can continue to serve as America\u2019s job creators."},

{"title": "Maine Congressional Delegation Urges Department of Education to Reverse Absurd Bureaucratic Decision that Jeopardizes Future Success of Hundreds of Maine Students", "date": ["Posted Fri, 04/14/2017 - 14:34"], "release": " \u2014 U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King and Representatives Bruce Poliquin and Chellie Pingree sent a letter to the Secretary of the Department of Education, Betsy DeVos, today to express their strong concern that the Department has refused to review the University of Maine at Presque Isle\u2019s (UMPI) application for two grants under the fiscal year 2017 Upward Bound Program competition due to an unintentional line-spacing issue the University was not permitted to correct.   The Upward Bound Program at UMPI serves 129 high school students across Aroostook County, Maine, and has a strong and long record of success in sending local low-income, first-generation students to college. Since 1980, it has helped students with great needs access the promise of higher education. Click   and read below for the full text of the letter. April 14, 2017 The Honorable Betsy DeVos Secretary U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W. Washington, D.C. 20202-8510 RE: University of Maine at Presque Isle\u2019s Upward Bound Grant Applications #P047A170346 and #P047A170352 Dear Secretary DeVos: We are writing to support the applications submitted by the University of Maine at Presque Isle (UMPI) for two grants under the fiscal year 2017 Upward Bound Program competition and to express our strong concern that the Department of Education has determined that these applications are ineligible for consideration. As strong supporters of the TRIO programs, we were particularly troubled to learn that UMPI\u2019s applications were ruled ineligible due an unintentional, minor formatting oversight, which UMPI has not been given an opportunity to correct. According to UMPI, the Department\u2019s decision risks, over the next five years, denying 960 disadvantaged high school students the chance to fulfill their academic potentials. The Notice Inviting Applications for New Awards (Notice) for the Upward Bound Program competition, published in the Federal Register on October 17, 2016, includes formatting criteria not mandated by Congress. They are arbitrarily drawn, entirely unrelated to the substance of the application, and do not provide any recourse for applicants to correct minor, unintentional, non-substantive mistakes. UMPI has applied for two Upward Bound Program grants, and both have been deemed ineligible for the same reason. We understand that the Department has relayed to UMPI that a line-spacing error, appearing within two info-graphics on two of the application\u2019s 65 pages, is the cause of the ineligibility determination, as these two pages do not comply with the Notice\u2019s double-spacing requirement. These info-graphics are intended to help the reader review the application efficiently and more easily and contain text that is 1.5 line spaced instead of double spaced. It is obvious that the figures merely supplement a well-prepared narrative. Were they removed, or were UMPI permitted to adjust the line spacing on these two pages, the application would easily warrant the Department\u2019s review. Yet unbelievably, the Department refuses to review UMPI\u2019s application and has provided no opportunity for UMPI to correct this trivial mistake. We strongly urge the Department to reconsider its decision and to allow UMPI\u2019s application to be read and scored. We appreciate that the formatting standards issued by the Department are intended to prevent applicants from attempting to gain an unfair advantage by using clever formatting strategies. When the application is reviewed as a whole, it is clear that UMPI is not seeking to mislead the Department or to gain any unfair advantage. In fact, the error was so insignificant that UMPI could not immediately identify it and had to seek additional guidance. Now, the Department\u2019s inflexible and bureaucratic decision could result in the elimination of a long-standing, successful, and greatly needed program on the basis of a non-substantive error before the application is even read. The Department has not identified for UMPI any other errors in its application. To deny UMPI\u2019s application a reading because two figures do not meet an arbitrary typographical format ignores the spirit of the Upward Bound Program, is antithetical to congressional intent, and would seriously jeopardize the future success of hundreds of students in Maine. The Upward Bound Program at UMPI serves 129 high school students across Aroostook County, Maine, and has a strong and long record of success in sending local low-income, first-generation students to college. Since 1980, it has helped students with great needs access the promise of higher education. We strongly urge the Department to apply some common sense to the Upward Bound Program competition and read and score UMPI\u2019s applications. ###"},
{"title": "Grandparents Raising Grandchildren: A Growing Trend Fueled by the Opioid Crisis", "date": ["Posted Mon, 04/17/2017 - 09:55"], "release": "The crisis of opioid abuse that is ravaging our state and our country is truly an epidemic. There were 376 deaths from drug overdose here in Maine last year, more than 52,000 nationwide \u2013 numbers that exceed the lives lost to car accidents, breast cancer, or a host of other causes. Those statistics are shocking. Here is one that is heartbreaking: last year, nearly 1,000 babies in Maine \u2013 that\u2019s about eight percent of all births \u2013 were born to women addicted to opioids and other drugs. In the United States, a baby is born with an opioid addiction every 25 minutes, more than two per hour. In this crisis, as in past crises, grandparents are coming to the rescue. Grandparents who help raise grandkids together with the child\u2019s parents can support healthy aging and be a positive experience for all involved. Across the country, however, some 2.5 million children are being raised solely by grandparents. These \u201ccustodial grandparents\u201d are called on to help for a number of reasons, including alcohol and drug addiction, physical abuse, incarceration, divorce, financial difficulties, military deployment, and even death. In Maine, the number of children being raised solely by their grandparents increased by 24 percent between 2010 and 2015. The Senate Aging Committee, which I chair, recently held a hearing on the growing phenomenon of grandparents raising grandchildren because the parents are struggling with addiction and can no longer care for their children. The purpose of our hearing was to recognize the grandparents raising grandkids and to explore what can be done to assist them as they take on this unanticipated challenge motivated by their love of their grandchildren. As one of our expert witnesses testified, from crack cocaine in the 1980s to opioids todays, drug addiction by one or both parents is one of the primary causes of these \u201cgrandfamilies.\u201d Also among our witnesses was Bette Hoxie, Executive Director of Adoptive and Foster Families of Maine and the Kinship Program, which has offices in Orono and Saco. Of the 3,100 families Bette\u2019s organization works with statewide, 85 percent are headed by grandparents or great-grandparents, many due to opioid abuse. From health care to clothing and cribs, she told the Committee of the struggles grandparents \u2013 including herself \u2013 face in the unexpected challenge of raising young children. At a time in life when most seniors are looking forward to enjoying more leisure time, these grandparents have found themselves as parents once again. They are waking up in the middle of the night to feed babies and planning afternoons around soccer practice, rather than playing golf or volunteering. Raising a second family also involves costs that they had never anticipated as they budgeted for what was supposed to be their golden years. They are tapping into retirement savings, going back to work, or staying in the workforce longer just to make ends meet. In addition to the financial toll, raising children later in life presents social, emotional, legal, and other challenges. It can be socially difficult to become a full time caregiver as an older adult, often isolated from friends. It can be emotionally difficult to go from being a grandmother who spoils the kids to becoming the disciplinarian who makes sure homework is finished. At the same time, it can also be difficult to navigate the relationship with the children\u2019s birth parents. The legal challenges are tough. The process of attaining custody is complex, lengthy, and costly. Without a proper legal arrangement, routine tasks such as enrolling kids in school or obtaining medical care can be trying. Becoming a full time caregiver can also take a toll on the health of the grandparents. The new caregiver role challenges both the physical and mental health of grandparents resulting in higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, and depression. This demonstration of love by family members must be accompanied by innovative policy solutions. Some of those solutions were included in the 21st Century Cures Act that was signed into law late last year. In addition to robust support for biomedical research to combat disease, this sweeping bipartisan law includes provisions I authored to address the opioid crisis. The bill includes $1 billion over two years for grants to states to supplement opioid abuse prevention and treatment activities, including prescription drug monitoring programs, prevention activities, training for health care providers, and improving access to opioid treatment programs. This money will benefit every state, including Maine. Last summer, the Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, which I cosponsored. This legislation will help address this burgeoning public health crisis through a multifaceted approach that expands treatment, prevention, law enforcement, and recovery efforts in our communities nationwide. It includes two important provisions I authored to increase research into non-opioid therapy for pain management and for the development of care plans for drug-dependent infants. Despite the challenges, when asked if they regret taking on the caregiver role, a vast majority of these grandparents say: no. They know they are making a difference. They are providing love, stability, and a home to children who might otherwise have to live with strangers. As one Maine grandparent said in a recent television interview, \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s worth it to know that they are happy and safe.\u201d Throughout history, grandparents have stepped in to provide safe and secure homes to their grandchildren, replacing traumatic pasts with loving and hopeful futures. The opioid crisis has called on grandparents in epic numbers. As a society, it is essential that we do all we can to help those grandparents who have stepped up to help ensure a better life for their children\u2019s children."},

I really like the idea of reaching across the aisle and making things work. I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to happen, but I hope you can do it \u2014 I have my sixth operation coming up.\u2019 \u201cFor the two weeks of spring recess, voters from Bangor to Bakersfield have been giving members of Congress an earful about what the chaos and do-nothing rancor of Trump-era Washington is costing them. But Senator Collins was not greeted with the rage that some Republican representatives have faced down, or run from. \u201cDespite its economic problems,  \u201cThat\u2019s why Ms. Collins, bless her heart, spent the run-up to her recess trying and failing to broker a deal to keep Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, from blowing up the filibuster, one of the last remaining vestiges of Senate comity, when Democrats threatened to block the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. It is why Mainers like Christine Guinness of Blue Hill, angry about Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood, call Ms. Collins \u2018reasonable,\u2019 after the senator wrote her to say she has \u2018consistently opposed the elimination of all federal funding for Planned Parenthood,\u2019 and acknowledged that Obamacare \u2018has brought some important improvements to our health insurance system.\u2019 \u201cAnd it is why,   Ms. Collins\u2019s plan would keep much of the most popular elements of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 allowing parents\u2019 plans to cover children up to age 26, covering those with pre-existing conditions, as well as preserving mental health and substance abuse benefits important to combating the drug epidemic, which has claimed scores of lives in the state. Instead of the \u2018individual mandate\u2019 that financially penalizes people who don\u2019t get insurance, Senator Collins\u2019s plan would auto-enroll uninsured people but let them opt out. That, Ms. Collins told the group, would help stabilize insurance pools by enrolling more young, healthy people. \u201cHer audience listened silently. \u201c\u2018Regardless of who was elected president, it was clear we were going to have to work on A.C.A.,\u2019 she said. \u2018New York magazine said I was the second Republican senator to come out against the House bill\u2019 that would have thrown 24 million people off their insurance plans over the next decade. Her plan, she said, is \u2018a starting point.\u2019 \u201cMr. Tuemmler had another story, of a friend who had spent $20,000 on deductibles in the few months after being found to have brain cancer. \u2018That\u2019s not affordable health care,\u2019 he said. \u201cMr. Trump later made clear he had another approach in mind, threatening to force Democrats to come to terms not with a call to conscience about the plights of people like Mr. Tuemmler, but by cutting the insurance subsidies to seven million low-income people. , as someone said \u2018yeah.\u2019 \u201cHer message wasn\u2019t meant for her audience. It has not been the people in Maine who have talked past each other. The problem is a president who promised that \u2018the forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer\u2019 and has quickly forgotten that promise, like so many others. \u201cFor Mr. Tuemmler, waiting for Mr. Trump to start listening is a luxury that, like his insurance, he can\u2019t afford.\u201d"},

{"title": "Collins, Klobuchar, Heitkamp Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Increase Number of Doctors in Rural and Other Medically Underserved Areas ", "date": ["Posted Thu, 04/13/2017 - 10:35"], "release": "\u00a0U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) introduced bipartisan legislation to boost the number of doctors able to work in rural America. The Conrad State 30 & Physician Access Act would allow international doctors to remain in the U.S. upon completing their residency under the condition that they practice in underserved areas, such as rural communities. \u201cWe must provide opportunities for American-trained and educated physicians to remain in the country and practice where there is an unmet need for quality care,\u201d  \u201cThis legislation would allow for expanded access to health care in our rural or underserved communities, and in turn, would promote healthier lives.\u201d \u201cRural communities in Minnesota and across the country are short on doctors, and they rely on the Conrad 30 program to fill the gaps. Over the last 15 years, the Conrad 30 program has brought more than 15,000 physicians to underserved areas,\u201d   \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to force doctors that we educate and train right here in the U.S. to leave our country once their residency is over. Our bipartisan legislation would make this critical program permanent, allow doctors to remain in the communities they serve, and improve healthcare for families across the nation.\u201d \u201cFamilies in rural America deserve access to the best doctors in the world,\u201d   \u201cThat\u2019s the entire purpose of the Conrad 30 program which has helped doctors from other countries who have been trained at our top notch universities and medical schools to stay here and serve those in rural areas and in other communities across North Dakota and the country that struggle to recruit and retain an adequate physician workforce. Making this critical program permanent would enable more doctors to use it to practice and support quality care in rural areas \u2013 that\u2019s something everyone should want to accomplish.\u201d Currently doctors from other countries working in America on J-1 visas are required to return to their home country after their residency has ended for two years before they can apply for another visa or green card. The Conrad 30 program allows doctors to stay in the U.S without having to return home if they agree to practice in an underserved area for three years. The \u201c30\u201d refers to the number of doctors per state that can participate in the program. The senators\u2019 legislation extends the Conrad 30 program until 2021, improves the process for obtaining a visa, and allows for the program to be expanded beyond 30 slots if certain thresholds are met, while still protecting small states. The bill also allows the spouses of doctors to work and provides worker protections to prevent the doctors from being mistreated. A version of the bill was included as an amendment in the comprehensive immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013. The legislation has received the endorsement of the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, and the American Association of Medical Colleges. \"The American Medical Association (AMA) strongly supports the \u201cConrad State 30 and Physician Access Act,\u201d a bill that would reauthorize the law for three years and make improvements to the J-1 visa waiver program,\u201d   \u201cJ-1 visa waivers play a significant role in placing physicians in communities that face healthcare access challenges. Many communities, including rural and low-income urban areas, struggle to attract physicians to meet their patient needs. This legislation will help ensure continued access to care in medically underserved communities across the U.S. We appreciate the leadership of Senators Klobuchar, Collins, and Heitkamp on this important issue and look forward to working to advance this legislation.\" \u201cThe latest extension of the Conrad State 30 Program will expire on April 28. We urge swift action to extend this vital program. Without timely reauthorization, many communities that have benefited from these physicians may find themselves without access to such services,\u201d   \u201cWe support the enactment of the program improvements contained in the Conrad State 30 and Physician Access Act as part of this extension and stand ready to work with you and your colleagues to accomplish this goal.\u201d"},

The Committee also discussed the results of USMMA\u2019s anonymous survey and report on sexual assault and sexual harassment. \u201cWhen parents send their children off to college, the last thing they expect is for them to endure repugnant and at times criminal behavior. Since parents entrust their children to our nation\u2019s service academies, we bear the responsibility to ensure the safety of the young people enrolled,\u201d   \u201cThe good news today is that current leadership at the Academy and at the Maritime Administration have shown a willingness to provide the necessary training and assistance, and more important, to change the culture and environment at the Academy. I want to assure the midshipmen, parents, and everyone associated with the Academy, that this is a problem we can solve, and absolutely must solve.\u201d \u201cAs with any other institution of higher education, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy has a responsibility to provide a safe environment for its students and faculty, and it must act with a much greater sense of urgency to address the increasing reports of sexual assault and harassment,\u201d   \u201cBy all accounts, the Maritime Administration was inexcusably slow to administer the requirements of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2009. This is an issue that cannot be solved with any one remedy or policy. It will take a concerted effort and multifaceted approach from the top down.\u201d \u201cWe acknowledge and commend the Department [of Transportation], [the Maritime Administration], and USMMA for their renewed focus on transforming USMMA\u2019s culture, closely examining its Sea Year, and better supporting victims of sexual assault and harassment,\u201d   \u201cHowever, as both our prior work and recent developments have shown, the Academy\u2019s success will hinge upon its ability to carry out strong follow-through and sustained attention at the highest levels.\u201d Sexual assault and harassment have long been persistent problems at USMMA. While current leadership has been working to improve training and change the culture at USMMA, the issue remains widespread. In a preliminary survey from the 2015-2016 academic year, 19.5 percent of women reported having been sexually assaulted, and 60 percent of women reported having been sexually harassed. In June 2016, the severity of this issue led then-Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx to temporarily suspend the Sea Year program, where midshipmen train on commercial shipping vessels, until the safety of all midshipmen could be guaranteed. The program has since been reinstated with specific requirements that promote a safe, zero tolerance environment. The Academy is also at risk of losing its accreditation over the failure to adequately address sexual assault and harassment incidents. Hearing witnesses included:"},

The hearing focused on the full arc of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, from contemporary prevention research focusing on clinical factors and lifestyle modifications that prevent cognitive decline, to assuring quality care for those living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other dementias. It also highlighted the human and economic toll of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The hearing was held in conjunction with the Alzheimer\u2019s Association\u2019s Advocacy Forum, which brought more than 1,000 advocates from across the country to Washington, D.C. Immediately prior to the hearing, Senator Collins met with Maine members of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. Many of the advocates wore purple, the color symbolizing Alzheimer\u2019s awareness. \u201cIt\u2019s always so inspiring to sit here and look out at the sea of purple. But it\u2019s also a reminder that this terrible disease has affected each and every one of you in some way,\u201d   \u201cOver the years, I have met family members who have sacrificed so much for their loved ones living with the disease. I have met Americans living with Alzheimer\u2019s with courage and determination; many of you are here today, and we welcome you.\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s disease is a devastating condition that takes a tremendous personal and financial toll on Americans. It costs the United States an estimated $259 billion a year, including $175 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid. This year marks the first time that total direct payments related to the care of individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s or other dementias will reach more than a quarter of a trillion dollars. These costs will skyrocket as the baby boom generation ages. There is no known prevention or treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, the hearing shed light on lifestyle factors have been shown to reduce cognitive decline, which often precedes Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In addition to advancing medical research and raising public awareness about Alzheimer\u2019s, it is imperative that we develop a workforce equipped to care for those living with dementia today.

This tragic situation mirrors a national trend, where a baby is born with an opioid addiction every 25 minutes. When parents who are struggling with addiction are no longer able to care for their children, grandparents are increasingly assuming the role of primary caregivers. The growing number of grandparents raising grandchildren, or \u201cgrandfamilies,\u201d which is being fueled by the opioid and heroin abuse epidemic, was the subject of a Senate Aging Committee hearing today chaired by U.S. Senator Susan Collins titled, \u201cGrandparents to the Rescue: Raising Grandchildren in the Opioid Crisis and Beyond.\u201d At Senator Collins\u2019 invitation, Bette Hoxie from Old Town, the Executive Director of Adoptive & Foster Families of Maine and the Kinship Program, testified. Today\u2019s hearing focused on the health and well-being of grandparents who take on the often-unexpected role of raising their grandchildren later in life and what Congress can do to address this effect of the opioid epidemic on grandparents. When taking on the responsibility of caring for their grandchildren, grandparents often significantly adjust their life plans, including postponing retirement, depleting their savings, dramatically altering their social lives, and challenging their physical and mental health. Grandfamilies can also be beneficial, however, by providing children with permanent homes, continued connections to community and cultural identity, and fewer school changes. Approximately 2.5 million children are currently being raised in grandfamilies. \"At a time in life when most seniors are looking forward to enjoying more leisure time, some grandparents have found themselves as parents once again,\u201d   \u201cThese grandparents are called on to help for a number of reasons, including alcohol and drug addiction, physical abuse, incarceration, divorce, financial difficulties, military deployment, and even death. In Maine, the number of children being raised solely by their grandparents increased by 24 percent between 2010 and 2015. Today\u2019s hearing recognized the grandparents raising grandkids and explored what can be done to assist them as they take on this unanticipated challenge motivated by their love of their grandchildren.\u201d \u201cLike so many other states, Maine is severely affected by the opioid crisis that permeates our nation and its vulnerable families,\u201d   \u201cMore and more infants are being born to mothers who are using opioids while pregnant. These births are taking a toll on a population of caring people who would -- if they could --simply love their grandchildren, spoil them, and send them home to be raised and nurtured by their parents. But for an all too growing number of families, this is no longer an option. Instead, the grandparents have become the primary caretakers.\u201d Bette spoke about the work her organization is doing to support grandfamilies. The Adoptive and Foster Families of Maine and the Kinship Program\u2019s team of professionals collects items such as furniture, bedding, and other goods to donate to grandparents; provides licensing and legal education; organizes support groups; and connects grandparents and grandchildren to the appropriate resources. Bette also shared her experience raising her grandson, who is now 18 years old, as well as a 19-month-old boy she is currently caring for. :"},

The   would establish a process to better coordinate the many existing federal home modification programs and provide more consumer-friendly information on how those programs can benefit older Americans. By helping older adults take advantage of federal programs to modify their homes, the legislation achieves the dual goals of helping people age more safely in place and creatively expanding the supply of accessible housing. Helping seniors age more safely at home may have important federal budgetary implications as well; by making low-cost, discretionary investments in improving home accessibility for older adults, these federal programs may help reduce costs in mandatory health care programs as senior health care outcomes improve. \u201cThis is classic case of government bureaucracy: there are well-intended programs that can help Maine seniors stay in their homes as they grow older, but they\u2019ve become so complicated to the point that no one knows how to use them or even how well they work,\u201d  . \u201cAnd when that happens, those programs no longer benefit Maine seniors or serve the taxpayer\u2019s interests. This legislation is an important step forward in cutting through the bureaucracy to get back to the heart of the program: ensuring that Maine seniors have the tools they need to live where they are most comfortable as they grow older.\u201d \u201cUnderstandably, the vast majority of seniors would prefer to stay in the comfort, security, and privacy of their own homes as they age,\u201d  .\u00a0 \u201cIn addition to allowing seniors to remain near friends, family, and loved ones, home modifications that increase accessibility are also highly cost effective.\u00a0 Our bipartisan legislation cuts through the unnecessary complexity that surround existing federal programs, helping more seniors to live independently and safely right where they want to be\u2014at home.\u201d \u201cOur bill will make it easier for seniors to live independently in their own homes and communities without taking on debt or sacrificing safety,\u201d  . \u201cClose to one in five Americans will be over the age of 65 in the next decade, but right now we\u2019re not on track to meet the need for safe, affordable housing for these seniors.\u201d Last year, the Bipartisan Policy Center released a report called Healthy Aging Begins at Home that identified numerous federal programs, benefits, or waivers spread across least five federal departments that can be used to pay for modifications, rehabilitations, or weatherization efforts on homes to help older Americans age in place. However, not all of those resources dedicate 100 percent of their funding to modifications while others may only narrowly target specific populations, like rural seniors or disabled veterans. The convoluted mix of programs and requirements is difficult to understand for older Americans, meaning that many of the programs may not be utilized to their best extent. Meanwhile, it\u2019s unclear how much federal funding is actually spent annually on home assessments and modifications for seniors. To help, the   would: These proposed changes are particularly important because they come at a time when a growing number of older adults have expressed a preference for aging in their own homes. A 2014 AARP survey of Maine residents older than 50 found that nearly 80 percent of respondents indicated that it was extremely or very important to remain in their home as they age, with 73 percent saying that support for funding services that enable seniors to remain in their homes should be a top or high priority. Furthermore, they come as the price of home modifications \u2013 even for relatively simply changes, such as the cost of putting grab bars in the shower, let alone significant changes like widening doors to allow for wheelchair access \u2013 can drain limited budgets. However, not making those modifications also runs the risk of being costlier in the long run. For example, a serious fall, which is the leading cause of injury for older adults, can result in large costs, both for the senior and for Medicare and Medicaid.

Susan Collins (R-ME), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Bill Nelson (D-FL), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) reintroduced their bipartisan legislation to update a current loophole in Medicare policy that would help protect seniors from high medical costs for the skilled nursing care they require after hospitalization. The Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act would allow for the time patients spend in the hospital under \u201cobservation status\u201d to count toward the requisite three-day hospital stay for coverage of skilled nursing care. Under the current Medicare policy, a beneficiary must have an \u201cinpatient\u201d hospital stay of at least three days in order for Medicare to cover post-hospitalization skilled nursing care. Patients that receive hospital care under \u201cobservation status\u201d do not qualify for this benefit, even if their hospital stay lasts longer than three days. \u201cWhen seniors require hospitalization, their focus should be on their health and getting well, not on how they were admitted,\u201d   \u201cThe financial consequences of this distinction between an observation stay and inpatient admittance can be severe for seniors. This bipartisan bill would deem time spent in observation status as inpatient care for the purpose of the Medicare three-day prior hospital stay requirement for skilled nursing care, which will help insulate older Americans from undue out-of-pocket costs and ensure that they get the care that they need.\u201d Senator Collins   on this topic last Congress. Specifically, the bill would: According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), outpatient classification is intended for providers to run tests and evaluate patients in order to arrive at appropriate diagnoses and treatment plans, or to provide brief episodes of treatment. In a December 2016 report, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services found that an increased number of Medicare beneficiaries classified as outpatients are paying more for care that is substantively similar, and have limited access to skilled nursing facility care due to their patient status. For the purposes of counting inpatient days, CMS considers a person an \u201cinpatient\u201d on the first day that the patient is formally admitted to the hospital because of a doctor\u2019s order; the last is the day before discharge. The Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act has been endorsed by more than 30 organizations, including: AARP, Alliance for Retired Americans, American Case Management Association, American Health Care Association, AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, Center for Medicare Advocacy, LeadingAge, National Association of Elder Law Attorneys, National Association of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs, National Center for Assisted Living, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, and the Society of Hospital Medicine."},

In a  , the senators urge Trump to support programs established by the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). VAWA was enacted in 1994 to support survivors of domestic and sexual violence. The law makes federal resources available for programs that assist victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking, including children, teenagers, the elderly, persons with disabilities and Native Americans. VAWA has been reauthorized by Congress and Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. \u201cWe encourage this Administration to again partner with Congress to champion critical VAWA programs aimed at preventing abuse, improving the law enforcement response to violence against women and children, and supporting survivors of domestic and sexual violence,\u201d   \u201cNow, more than ever, it is imperative that we support victims and survivors by investing in VAWA to ensure that service providers and law enforcement personnel are equipped with the necessary tools to protect victims and to bring perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence to justice.\u201d The letter is also signed by Senators Dean Heller (R-Nev.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Bob Casey (D-Pa.).  follows: February 28, 2017 President Donald J. Trump The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Northwest Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear Mr. President: We write today to urge you to join us in supporting the programs authorized by the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) during the current year\u2019s budget process. Many of us have worked for decades to raise public awareness about sexual and domestic violence, improve services and resources for survivors, and improve the criminal justice system\u2019s response to crimes of domestic and sexual violence. Since its enactment in 1994, VAWA has helped States and communities throughout the country make significant progress in meeting these goals, but there is still much work to be done; for example, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 22.3 percent of women and 14 percent of men have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetimes. Congress and Presidents William J. Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama supported the reauthorization of VAWA on three occasions, evidencing a national, bipartisan commitment to supporting victims of sexual and domestic violence in their recovery. Congress also has appropriated significant resources to support the grant programs authorized under this landmark statute over the last two decades. We encourage this Administration to again partner with Congress to champion critical VAWA programs aimed at preventing abuse, improving the law enforcement response to violence against women and children, and supporting survivors of domestic and sexual violence. Funding for these programs is critical to meeting the needs of victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. The victims of these crimes can include children and teenagers, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and Native women, among others. State, tribal, and local governments, law enforcement agencies, nonprofit organizations, as well as colleges and universities rely on VAWA funding to facilitate these victims\u2019 recovery from the often life-shattering effects of domestic and sexual violence and prevent further acts of violence. Community assistance programs across the country reportedly are experiencing severe budget shortfalls, forcing domestic violence shelters to close or reduce services. Rape crisis centers and domestic violence programs in multiple states report a shortage of funds and staff to assist victims in need of services, particularly in the areas of transitional housing, emergency shelters and legal representation. According to a 2015 survey by the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, over one-third of rape crisis centers have a waiting list for basic services. Finally, we urge you to support these key VAWA programs not only because they save lives but also because they are smart investments. VAWA programs have long-term positive impacts for victims of abuse and children who witness violence against family members. They also help stop the generational cycle of violence. Assistance funded through VAWA ensures emergency shelter, legal advocacy, and counseling for victims in the aftermath of abuse. Grants provide training and educational sessions for parents, teachers, law enforcement, and other professionals to prevent, identify, and respond to domestic and sexual violence. Mr. President, we hope that you will join in our efforts to secure continued, adequate funding levels for these proven cost-effective, life-saving programs. To this end, we encourage you to make VAWA funding a priority in your proposed budget for fiscal year 2018. Sincerely,"},

Susan Collins (R-ME), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Bill Nelson (D-FL), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) reintroduced their bipartisan legislation to update a current loophole in Medicare policy that would help protect seniors from high medical costs for the skilled nursing care they require after hospitalization. The Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act would allow for the time patients spend in the hospital under \u201cobservation status\u201d to count toward the requisite three-day hospital stay for coverage of skilled nursing care. Under the current Medicare policy, a beneficiary must have an \u201cinpatient\u201d hospital stay of at least three days in order for Medicare to cover post-hospitalization skilled nursing care. Patients that receive hospital care under \u201cobservation status\u201d do not qualify for this benefit, even if their hospital stay lasts longer than three days. \u201cWhen seniors require hospitalization, their focus should be on their health and getting well, not on how they were admitted,\u201d   \u201cThe financial consequences of this distinction between an observation stay and inpatient admittance can be severe for seniors. This bipartisan bill would deem time spent in observation status as inpatient care for the purpose of the Medicare three-day prior hospital stay requirement for skilled nursing care, which will help insulate older Americans from undue out-of-pocket costs and ensure that they get the care that they need.\u201d Senator Collins   on this topic last Congress. Specifically, the bill would: According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), outpatient classification is intended for providers to run tests and evaluate patients in order to arrive at appropriate diagnoses and treatment plans, or to provide brief episodes of treatment. In a December 2016 report, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services found that an increased number of Medicare beneficiaries classified as outpatients are paying more for care that is substantively similar, and have limited access to skilled nursing facility care due to their patient status. For the purposes of counting inpatient days, CMS considers a person an \u201cinpatient\u201d on the first day that the patient is formally admitted to the hospital because of a doctor\u2019s order; the last is the day before discharge. The Improving Access to Medicare Coverage Act has been endorsed by more than 30 organizations, including: AARP, Alliance for Retired Americans, American Case Management Association, American Health Care Association, AMDA \u2013 The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, Center for Medicare Advocacy, LeadingAge, National Association of Elder Law Attorneys, National Association of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs, National Center for Assisted Living, National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, and the Society of Hospital Medicine."},

During a hearing today focused on financial fraud affecting seniors, the Committee  , outlining the top ten most commonly reported scams to its toll-free Fraud Hotline (1-855-303-9470) over the past year. Of the 2,282 calls received by the hotline \u2013 calls pertaining to the top ten scams featured in the 2017 Fraud Book accounted for more than 90 percent of the complaints. In videotaped testimony before the Committee, an 81-year-old man from Portland, Maine, described how he became the victim of the top complaint to the hotline, the IRS impersonation scam. Philip Hatch described how he received a call from a fraudster posing as an agent of the Internal Revenue Service who told him he owed back taxes and needed to pay immediately, using iTunes gift cards, or he would be arrested. Believing that the caller was an official government employee, Mr. Hatch, a 23-year Navy veteran, complied and ultimately lost $8,000 to this scam artist. \u201cBeing in the military and working for the government \u2013 you know, when the government calls you up, you say \u2018aye aye, sir. What do you need? Can I help you?\u2019 Maybe if I hadn\u2019t had that background, I wouldn\u2019t have been so cooperative? But I was mad \u2013 upset that I was taken in,\u201d Mr. Hatch said in his testimony. Timothy Camus, Deputy Inspector General for Investigations at the U.S. Treasury Department, testified that more than 1.8 million Americans have reported receiving calls from individuals impersonating IRS or Treasury Department employees. Those who fell victim to the scam have lost a total of $54 million. According to the Government Accountability Office, financial fraud targeting older Americans is a growing epidemic that costs seniors an estimated $2.9 billion annually. \u201cAs our 2017 Fraud Book makes clear, while we are certainly making progress, far too many victims are still losing money and, often, their retirement savings. Law enforcement, consumer protection, Area Agencies on Aging, AARP, and financial institutions play vital roles, but alert citizens are still our first and best line of defense,\u201d   \u201cI am proud of the Committee\u2019s work on this crucial issue to help seniors become more aware and more informed, and to put criminals on notice that they will be stopped and brought to justice.\u201d \u201cIn the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, more than one-in-six residents is aged 65 or older,\u201d   \u201cAs a result, I know all too well how vulnerable older Americans can be to fraudsters and scam artists and other abuse. He continued, \u201cThat is why enforcement is such a critical part of this discussion. While it may not be easy to track down these increasingly sophisticated scammers and their domestic and international networks and hold them accountable, we must do so for the safety and security of our parents and grandparents. I know that the tireless work of this Committee and the federal agencies here today has helped make progress toward this goal.\u201d Diane Menio, Executive Director of the Center for Advocacy for the Rights & Interests of the Eldery (CARIE) in Philadelphia said the need to prevent financial exploitation of seniors is imperative.

{"title": "ICYMI: \u201cIn Divided Senate, Maine's Susan Collins Emerges As Critical Voice\u201d", "date": ["Posted Fri, 02/10/2017 - 09:51"], "release": "NPR | By: Ailsa Chang Susan Collins has broken both of her ankles. She broke her left one when she was running in high heels to the Senate chamber because she so desperately refused to miss a vote. The Maine Republican has the second-longest voting streak in the Senate, by the way, after fellow Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa. \"He has a longer streak, but I'm the only one who's never missed a single vote,\" said Collins in a recent interview in her office, referring to Grassley missing votes early in his Senate career. Not that she's keeping track. Collins, at 64, broke her right ankle just several weeks ago \u2014 when she slipped on black ice on her doorstep in Maine. And now, you'll find her gliding through the halls of Congress in a motorized scooter. At the scooter's maximum speed, a reporter would need to run to keep up with the senator. (This was confirmed when we took her scooter for a test-sprint outside her office this week.) And these wheels came just in time \u2013 because Collins is getting chased down by hordes of reporters lately. The success of President Trump's agenda will depend in large part on how unified Republicans are in a very narrowly divided Senate. And that's why all eyes are once again on Collins of Maine.  Gentle-mannered and almost always smiling \u2014 even when she's causing her party headaches \u2013 Collins is the Republican vote both sides watch. So in a chamber divided 52 to 48, with the most polarizing White House in modern history, her Republican colleagues say it matters more than ever now if Collins is a \"no\" vote.  \"She's not as ideological as a lot of members of the conference. And when you have 52 votes in the United States Senate, it doesn't take much to change the balance of power.\" That was evident when Collins was one of two Republicans who opposed Betsy DeVos to be education secretary, which led to the first tie-breaker vote in history by a vice president on a Senate confirmation. Collins is also leaning against drastically changing Senate rules \u2013 invoking the so-called \"nuclear option\" \u2013 to let Republicans confirm their Supreme Court nominee with 51 votes instead of the usual 60. On health care, she's wanted to slow down repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and she's co-sponsoring the only Republican bill that gives states the option of keeping Obamacare. \"Susan is used to being in this territory.  \"We have hope that we can continue to appeal to her. We don't always win our case with her.  Last November, Collins wrote in a vote for House Speaker Paul Ryan for president. She now says she does want to see Trump succeed, but she's spoken out against him many times already since the election. She's criticized Trump's executive order on refugee resettlement and his decision to give Steve Bannon, the White House chief strategist, a permanent seat on the National Security Council principals committee.  But the spotlight is a lot more intense these days. \"I do feel more pressure,\" said Collins. \"This is not a completely unfamiliar role because I have been a deciding vote many times in the past \u2013 and it's never a comfortable position \u2013 but I can't tell you the number of people in Maine and elsewhere who have come up to me and have said to me, 'Are you going to be there for us? Are you going to protect us?'\" She's literally caught in the middle. In northern Maine, Trump won by 11 points. In southern Maine, Hillary Clinton won by 14 points. She acutely hears both sides of the fight right within her home state. Collins grew up in the small northern town of Caribou, where both her parents served as mayor and where her family has operated a lumber business since the 19th century. Her father went on to serve in both houses of the state legislature. \"I understand, coming from northern Maine, that Donald Trump's message really resonated with people who had lost their jobs due to poorly negotiated trade deals and are feeling disenfranchised, and are feeling that they've been left behind,\" said Collins. \"And in the more prosperous southern part of the state, which is more diverse ethnically, I understand the concerns that people have about refugees, for example, and minority populations that have come into our state.\" Maine has produced a long line of moderate politicians. But the other senator from Maine, independent Angus King, says being moderate now, in such a politically charged climate, can be much harder. \"Because people from both sides are so passionate. You know, 'if you're not 100 percent for me, you're against me.' People are being pulled to the edges. You rarely see huge rallies of moderates,\" said King, laughing. And there's power in that.

Collins' remarks as delivered Click   to watch Sen. Collins' remarks  \u2014 As leading proponents of home health care and ensuring that Medicare patients have access to this crucial health care option, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, and Ben Cardin (D-MD) have introduced the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act. The bill will improve the access Medicare beneficiaries have to home health care by allowing physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and certified nurse midwives to order home health services, all of which are playing increasingly important roles in the delivery of health care, particularly in rural and underserved areas of our nation. \u201cHome health care is a crucial component to quality health care and should be more accessible to Medicare patients,\u201d   \u201cI have learned of far too many cases of seniors who experienced unnecessary delays in accessing home health care. To avoid these needless delays, it is common sense that other medical professionals who are familiar with a patient\u2019s case should be able to order these services.\u201d \"Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and certified nurse midwives play an important role in managing and delivering health care,\"  \"This bipartisan legislation recognizes how critical these providers are to delivering home health services to Medicare beneficiaries and ensures seniors will have timely access to needed services.\" Under current law, only physicians are allowed to certify or initiate home health care for Medicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the patient\u2019s case as the non-physician provider. In some cases, the certifying physician may not even have a relationship with the patient and must rely on the recommendation of the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife to order the medically necessary home health care. In too many cases, these requirements create obstacles, delays, and unnecessary paperwork to the process before home health care can be provided. The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act removes the needless delays in getting Medicare patients the home health care they need simply because a physician is not available to sign the form required by law. The Collins-Cardin legislation is supported by a broad coalition of organizations, including the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, the American Nurses Association, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, the American College of Nurse Midwives, and the Visiting Nurse Associations of America."},

{"title": "Senator Collins to Oppose EPA Administrator Nominee\u2019s Confirmation", "date": ["Posted Wed, 02/15/2017 - 17:02"], "release": " \u2014 U.S. Senator Susan Collins announced today that she will oppose the confirmation of Scott Pruitt to become Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Her full statement follows: \u201cAfter careful consideration, I have decided to oppose the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, the nominee for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). I have met at length with Mr. Pruitt, who is an accomplished attorney with considerable knowledge about environmental laws. We discussed many important environmental issues about which I care deeply\u2014from EPA\u2019s enforcement of landmark environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, to climate change and the Clean Power Plan, to protections from harmful pollutants such as lead and mercury. I also have reviewed testimony from his confirmation hearing. \u201cIn keeping with my past practice, regardless of which party is in the White House, I will vote for cloture on his nomination so that every Senator can have a clear, up or down vote on this important nomination of a member of the President\u2019s Cabinet. But I will vote no on Mr. Pruitt\u2019s confirmation. \u201cThe fact is, Mr. Pruitt and I have fundamentally different views of the role and mission of the EPA. That does not mean that I agree with every regulatory action that EPA has taken. At times, the Agency has been difficult to work with and unresponsive to bipartisan congressional concerns. But the EPA plays a vital role in implementing and enforcing landmark laws that protect not only our environment but also public health. \u201cSpecifically, I have significant concerns that Mr. Pruitt has actively opposed and sued EPA on numerous issues that are of great importance to the state of Maine, including mercury controls for coal-fired power plants and efforts to reduce cross-state air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. His actions leave me with considerable doubts about whether his vision for the EPA is consistent with the Agency's critical mission to protect human health and the environment. \u201cThe state of Maine, located at the end of our nation\u2019s \u201cair pollution tailpipe,\u201d is on the receiving end of pollution generated by coal-fired power plants in other states. Reducing harmful air pollutants is critical for public health, particularly for Maine which has among the highest rates of asthma in the country. Controls for mercury, one of the most persistent and dangerous pollutants, are especially important for children and pregnant women. Moreover, there is no doubt that the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change pose a significant threat to our state\u2019s economy and our natural resources, from our working forests, fishing, and agricultural industries, to tourism and recreation. \u201cThe opposition to the nominee expressed by Friends of Acadia is grounded in concerns about the importance of emissions reductions for lessening the impacts of climate change that affect this gem of a national park. The changes we are already seeing in the aquatic life in Casco Bay and the Gulf of Maine, for example, are cause for alarm. The incidence of Lyme disease in northern Maine and high asthma rates throughout the State are also linked to environmental changes that threaten the health and well-being of too many Maine people. \u201cThese are among the reasons why I have voted to uphold the EPA rule governing mercury and air toxics standards from coal-fired power plants and the cross-state air pollution rule, as well as the Clean Power Plan to limit carbon pollution from existing and new fossil fuel-fired power plants. \u201cI reject the false choice of pitting the environment against the economy because for much of the state of Maine, the economy and the environment are inextricably linked. A strong commitment to protecting the health of our nation\u2019s environment is critical for protecting Maine\u2019s natural beauty, the state\u2019s economy, and the health of those of us fortunate enough to call Maine home. \u201cDue to my concerns about Mr. Pruitt's commitment to the mission of the EPA, I will cast my vote in opposition to his confirmation.\u201d"},

The bill aligns and links existing systems and funding streams to target both parents and children with support aimed at increasing economic security, educational success, social capital, and the health and wellbeing of whole families. \u201cJust as a child\u2019s ZIP code should not determine his or her future success, neither should bureaucratic inflexibility make it so difficult for families to get the help they need to escape intergenerational poverty,\u201d   \u201cIt has been more than 50 years since President Lyndon Johnson declared a \u2018War on Poverty.\u2019 Despite our good intentions and having spent trillions of dollars, we have made very limited progress in lifting families out of poverty.

{"title": "An Important Step Forward in the Fight for Those with Diabetes", "date": ["Posted Wed, 02/22/2017 - 07:28"], "release": "Since founding the Senate Diabetes Caucus when I first joined the Senate in 1997, I have advocated for the investments that led to breakthroughs in diabetes research and for policies to alleviate the difficulties and heartbreak diabetes causes for so many American families as they await a cure. Medicare has now adopted a policy I have long championed to provide coverage for an effective, lifesaving device \u2013 the continuous glucose monitor \u2013 that is helping millions of Americans with diabetes who rely on the CGM to successfully manage the disease. Diabetes affects people of every age, race, and nationality. Nearly 30 million Americans have diabetes, and 86 million more have prediabetes. It is the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness in adults, and amputations not related to injury, and it is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, claiming some 70,000 lives each year. The human and economic toll of diabetes is devastating. If present trends continue, one in three adults \u2013 one in two among minority populations \u2013 will have diabetes in 2050. The annual cost of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes and gestational diabetes exceeds $176 billion. This is unacceptable and unsustainable. The lives of people living with, and at risk for, diabetes are better because of National Institutes of Health research and Centers for Disease Control prevention activities. Due to the Special Diabetes Program and increased investments in diabetes research, we have seen some encouraging breakthroughs and are on the threshold of a number of important new discoveries. We\u2019ve made progress, but much more must be done. This is particularly true for the estimated 1.2 million Americans living with type 1 diabetes. Advances in technology, like continuous glucose monitors, are helping patients control their blood glucose levels, which is essential to preventing costly and sometimes deadly diabetes complications. In a major step forward that will revolutionize diabetes care, the FDA also recently approved the first artificial pancreas, a device that will automatically control blood glucose levels. The National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration have been extremely supportive of these innovations in diabetes care. As Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I have been concerned that insulin-dependent Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes were being denied coverage for CGMs because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that they do not meet the Medicare definition of durable medical equipment and do not fall under any other Medicare category. As a result, similar to what we saw with insulin pumps in the late 1990s, individuals with diabetes have had coverage for their continuous glucose monitor on their private insurance, only to lose it when they age into Medicare. Today, about 95 percent of commercial insurers provide coverage for CGM devices. A CGM is a physician-prescribed, FDA-approved medical device that can provide real-time readings and data about trends in glucose levels every five minutes, thus enabling someone with insulin-dependent diabetes to eat or take insulin and prevent dangerously low or high glucose levels. As demonstrated by extensive clinical evidence, adults using a CGM have had improved overall glucose control and have reduced rates of hypoglycemia or low blood glucose levels. Professional medical societies, including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the Endocrine Society, recognize this clinical evidence and have published guidelines recommending CGMs be used in appropriate patients with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes treatments have dramatically improved in recent years. Not long ago, testing glucose levels involved test tubes and urine sticks \u2013 inaccurate tests that provided four-hour old results. Today, patients can check with a blood glucose meter, which shows current glucose levels and is significantly more accurate. The CGM is a potential life-saver for diabetes patients because it prevents dangerously low and high blood glucose levels by alarming the wearer when glucose levels fall outside of a safe range. Even though 95 percent of private insurers cover CGM technology, Medicare did not. Prior to this much-needed rule change, insulin-dependent Medicare beneficiaries were denied coverage for this potentially lifesaving device based on an improper and outdated policy. I am so pleased that our advocacy has spurred this change in policy that will help change our country\u2019s future with regard to diabetes and immediately help to alleviate the financial and human harm caused by this epidemic."},
{"title": "Collins and Cardin, Kelly and Blumenauer Introduce Bipartisan, Bicameral Bill to Stimulate Infrastructure Development through the Preservation of Historic Properties", "date": ["Posted Thu, 02/23/2017 - 16:53"], "release": " \u2014 U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Ben Cardin (D-MD) and Congressmen Mike Kelly (R-PA) and Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) have introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation that would encourage infrastructure development and job growth across the country by making common-sense changes and enhancements to the federal Historic Tax Credit (HTC). \u00a0The legislation is supported by GrowSmart Maine, among other organizations. \u201cThe Historic Tax Credit incentivizes the restoration and preservation of historic buildings. It is a proven tool for revitalizing communities and catalyzing economic development in Maine and across the nation. Since 2008, the Historic Tax Credit has leveraged approximately $350 million in private investment in Maine alone,\u201d   \u201cOur bipartisan legislation will make the Historic Tax Credit easier to use, expanding its economic benefit and creating good-paying jobs for hardworking Americans.\u201d Congress created historic preservation tax benefits in 1976 to encourage voluntary, private-sector investment in preserving historic buildings. The program is jointly managed by the National Park Service (NPS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in partnership with State Historic Preservation Offices. Since its creation, the HTC program has generated $78 billion in historic preservation activity to rehabilitate more than 41,250 historic properties, including the creation of over 525,000 housing units, of which approximately 150,000 are low and moderate-income units. Historic preservation programs have created more than 2.36 million jobs nationwide since 1978 (85,058 new jobs in FY 2015, the latest year for which data are available). A recent study by the National Trust for Historic Preservation estimates that every $1 of credits generates a minimum of $4 of private sector investment. \u201cThe federal historic tax credit is the driving force behind rehabilitation projects that have given new life to historic buildings, created millions of jobs and attracted billions in private investment,\u201d   \u201cWe commend Sens. Collins and Cardin and Reps. Kelly and Blumenauer for their leadership in proposing sound improvements to the federal historic tax credit. Now, more libraries, theaters, town halls and other buildings can be restored to serve their communities in new ways. Tax reform aimed at growing the economy should enhance the historic tax credit.\u201d In Maine, the federal HTC has supported numerous projects, from the renovation of the former Eastland hotel in Portland, to the redevelopment of the Moosehead Manufacturing Mill in Dover-Foxcroft. The Historic Tax Credit Improvement Act makes changes to the HTC to further encourage building reuse and redevelopment in small, midsize, and rural communities. It also makes the rehabilitation of community projects like theaters, libraries, and schools easier while maximizing the impact of state historic tax credits.

{"title": "Collins, Casey, Grassley, Leahy Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Protect Older Workers from Discrimination", "date": ["Posted Mon, 02/27/2017 - 10:45"], "release": " \u2014 Today, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Bob Casey (D-PA), the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Aging Committee, along with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT), introduced the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act (POWADA). The legislation would restore the ability of older workers to take legal action when age discrimination affected their professional opportunities. Additionally, it would reaffirm that workers may use any type of admissible evidence to prove their claims. \u201cOlder employees bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the workplace, and we should do all we can to ensure that these employees are able to participate fully in the workforce,\u201d   \u201cI have advocated for many measures that would help end workplace discrimination, and as the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, it is a high priority of mine to ensure that seniors have the ability to do their jobs without facing age-related bias.\u201d \u201cSince the Great Recession, too many Americans in their 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s have had difficulty receiving a fair shot in the workforce,\u201d   \u201cThis legislation will make sure that older Americans have the tools to fight back against any age discrimination. These are the Americans that have fought our wars and raised the nation\u2019s children and they should not face age discrimination in the job market.\u201d A Supreme Court ruling in 2009 held that age discrimination claims must prove that discrimination was not just a motivating factor but the sole or overriding factor in an adverse employment decision. This put a higher burden on older workers alleging age discrimination than on those alleging discrimination based on race, sex, national origin or religion. The legislation would level the playing field for older workers by restoring the pre-2009 legal standards for age discrimination claims, ensuring that everyone has equal access to the courts and reinforcing the essential principle that no amount of age discrimination is acceptable in the workplace. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). While the ADEA marked an important step in protecting older workers from discrimination and has provided essential protections to millions of workers for decades, discrimination on the basis of age remains a significant problem. A 2013 AARP study found that almost two in three workers ages 45-74 reported experiencing age discrimination in the work place. Age discrimination is a key reason why many older Americans have trouble finding work after a period of unemployment and why many who are employed get paid less than their younger counterparts. AARP has endorsed this legislation, and in a letter supporting its introduction in 2013, AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond said, \u201cUntil Congress passes this bill, too many older workers who have been victims of age discrimination will be denied a fair shake in our justice system. . . . The persistence of age discrimination in its many forms remains a significant barrier to older Americans\u2019 retirement security.\u201d"},
{"title": "The Senior $afe Act: A Commonsense, Bipartisan Plan to Protect Seniors from Fraud", "date": ["Posted Mon, 02/27/2017 - 13:54"], "release": "From scams originating overseas to exploitation by trusted family members and guardians at home, financial fraud targeting older Americans is a growing epidemic that costs an estimated $2.9 billion annually. As Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, one of my top priorities is to protect seniors from the criminals who seek to rob them of their hard-earned life savings. The Aging Committee has been vigorously investigating fraud and financial exploitation against seniors. One factor common to all the scams we have examined is that fraudsters need to gain the trust and active cooperation of their victims. The Senior $afe Act I have introduced in the new Congress would put in place a commonsense plan to help protect American seniors from financial exploitation and fraud. The bill encourages financial institutions to train their employees in how to spot financial exploitation of older Americans, and shields them from lawsuits for making good faith, reasonable reports of potential fraud to the proper authorities. I am so pleased that this important legislation has received the endorsement of AARP, our nation\u2019s largest senior organization. In addition, the Senior $afe Act is supported by many financial-services regulators and providers across the country. This bipartisan legislation is based on Maine\u2019s innovative Senior $afe program, a collaborative effort by Maine\u2019s regulators, financial institutions, and aging and legal organizations to educate bank and credit union employees on how to identify and help stop financial exploitation of older Mainers. Last year, the Senate Aging Committee held a hearing examining programs on the state level that aim to stop financial exploitation of seniors. Included in this hearing was testimony from Jaye Martin, the Director of Maine\u2019s Legal Services for the Elderly. During the hearing, I asked Ms. Martin about the effectiveness of the Senior $afe program in fighting the financial exploitation of seniors in Maine. In response, she stated: \u201cSenior $afe has been an extraordinary success\u2026 Hundreds of financial institution managers and employees have been trained, and we are really seeing that increase the number of seniors that are getting help before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Current bank privacy laws can make it difficult for financial institutions to report suspected fraud to the proper authorities. The Senior$afe Act would address this problem by encouraging banks, credit unions, investment advisors, broker-dealers, insurance companies and insurance agencies to report suspected senior financial fraud, and would protect these institutions from being sued so long as they have trained their employees, and make reports in good faith and on a reasonable basis to the proper authorities. The first of its kind in the United States, Maine\u2019s Senior$afe program was launched in 2014 and has empowered and encouraged financial service representatives throughout our State to identify warning signs of common scams and help stop financial fraud targeting our seniors. Two recent cases illustrate the importance of this initiative: Maine\u2019s Senior$afe program trains financial-service professionals to spot the red flags that signal potential fraud. Unfortunately, many seniors miss these flags because the swindlers who prey on them are extremely crafty and know how to sound convincing and trustworthy. A warning sign that can slip by a victim, however, might trigger a second look by a financial service representative trained to spot common scams and who knows enough about a senior's habits to question a transaction that doesn\u2019t look right. In our work on the Aging Committee, we have heard of many instances where quick action by bank and credit union employees and investment advisors has stopped a fraud in progress, saving their customers untold thousands of dollars. Combating financial abuse of seniors requires regulators, law enforcement, and social service agencies at all levels of government to work collaboratively with the private sector. Financial institutions occupy a critical nexus between fraudsters and their victims and can play an important role. Their employees, if properly trained, can be the first line of defense protecting our seniors from these fraudsters. Based on the outstanding model created here in Maine, the Senior$afe Act will give financial professionals nationwide the ability to combat fraud when they see it, as they safeguard the privacy of their customers, so that all of America\u2019s seniors can enjoy the greater security this important program is providing here in our State."},

Collins, Cardin, Casey, and Heller Renew Call for an End to Caps on Therapy Services under Medicare", "date": ["Posted Thu, 02/02/2017 - 09:53"], "release": " \u2014 U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Bob Casey (D-PA), and Dean Heller (R-NV) have re-introduced the Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act, which would protect Medicare beneficiaries from arbitrary limits on outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services that are often needed to recover from debilitating illnesses, such as stroke, or support the effective management of conditions including multiple sclerosis and arthritis. \"An arbitrary cap on therapy that can help a senior or a younger person disabled by an illness or accident to regain abilities makes no sense,\u201d   \u201cThis legislation would ensure appropriate access to important outpatient rehabilitation services under the Medicare program to ensure that beneficiaries recovering from a stroke, hip fracture, or other diseases or conditions requiring extensive therapy can receive all of the services they need. In addition to improving the health and well-being of seniors, rehabilitation is also more cost effective than similar services provided in the hospital outpatient setting, which are not subject to the caps.\u201d Limits on outpatient rehabilitation therapy services under Medicare were first imposed in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget Act. The decision to impose limits on these services was not based on data, quality-of-care concerns, or clinical judgment\u2014its sole purpose was to limit spending in order to balance the federal budget. Since 1997, Congress has acted over 16 times to prevent the implementation of the therapy caps through moratoriums and an exceptions process. While these short-term actions have provided necessary relief to our seniors, a long-term solution is essential to bring permanent relief and much-needed stability for both patients and providers. In a 2009 report issued by the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MEDPAC), it was estimated that the therapy cap, if enforced without an exceptions process, could negatively impact 931,000 Medicare beneficiaries. Arbitrarily capping outpatient rehabilitation therapy services would likely cause some beneficiaries to delay necessary care, force others to assume higher out-of-pocket costs, and disrupt the continuum of care for many seniors and individuals with disabilities. The Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act is supported by a broad coalition of organizations representing the interests of patients, consumers and health care providers. Similar bipartisan legislation in the House of Representatives was introduced Wednesday by Representatives Eric Paulsen (R-Minn.) and Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.)."},

{"title": "ICYMI: \"Is an Obamacare solution already staring Congress in the face?\"", "date": ["Posted Thu, 01/26/2017 - 12:07"], "release": "WASHINGTON - Sen. Susan Collins was \u201cdisappointed\u201d \u2013 decorous Senate speak for really, really unhappy. But Democrats panned the bill before it got out of the starting gate \u2013 even while observers say it could point the way out of the political wilderness over what to do about Obamacare. Minority leader Charles Schumer (D) of New York described the bill as an \u201cempty fa\u00e7ade\u201d that would create \u201cchaos\u201d not care. To Senator Collins, Senator Schumer\u2019s response was disappointing for reasons beyond her bill \u2013 and speaks to Washington\u2019s challenge going forward.  \u201cI guess what disappoints me most,\u201d Collins said, \u201cis that the Democratic leader\u2019s response really represents what\u2019s wrong with Washington, D.C.\u201d \u201cIf we are going to have a leader on the other side of the aisle denounce to the press and come to the Senate floor to criticize a bill \u2026 that has not even been introduced yet, where are we?\u201d she added. While Republicans can use a budgetary maneuver to easily repeal the guts of the ACA, at some point, replacement legislation is going to have to go through the Senate, where most legislation has to clear a 60-vote threshold to pass. That will necessarily involve Democratic buy-in given the GOP\u2019s slim 52-to-48 majority. \u201cIf you can say to a blue-state senator who\u2019s really invested in supporting Obamacare, \u2018You can keep Obamacare, but why force it upon us?\u2019 we think that helps us get to 60,\u201d Cassidy told reporters on Monday. In describing their bill, the Patient Freedom Act, Cassidy told reporters that allowing states to decide what they want follows a \u201cRepublican principle\u201d and will help his colleagues accept an Obamacare option for states that want it. The bill\u2019s key alternative option for states would do away with individual and employer mandates and benefit requirements, and instead auto-enroll everyone who isn\u2019t covered by employer or public healthcare in a basic package. That package would include individual, federally funded health savings accounts, a high-deductible health plan, and a basic pharmacy benefit. People could opt out of the plan, or purchase more insurance. This alternative would enlarge the pool of covered customers, the bill\u2019s authors explain, theoretically covering all of a state's uninsured population. It would keep the popular parts of the Affordable Care Act, including no life-time caps on care, no prohibition of pre-existing conditions, and allowing young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance. And it would reportedly be paid for with the taxes and Medicare savings that now fund the Affordable Care Act. States would also receive funding for the current law\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2013 even if they do not expand Medicaid. That funding sounds \u201cfairly generous,\u201d says Ms. Cox. But it\u2019s also another reason why budget-hawk Republicans would oppose the plan. Indeed, Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the leader of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, has come out against the bill, saying Obamacare needs to go entirely. Democrats, meanwhile, won\u2019t like the uneven standards for Americans, with consumers in ACA states having a higher level of benefits than those in non-ACA states. \u201cYou could be setting up a situation where you have individuals in similar situations, but in different states, who might receive different healthcare insurance coverage,\u201d says G. William Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Still, he says he sees the bill as \u201ca good step forward,\u201d adding that  Schumer\u2019s rejection of the bill should not be taken as a final no, suggests Lawrence Jacobs, a political scientist at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. \u201cI think Schumer was saying \u2018We\u2019re not a cheap date,\u2019 \u201d Professor Jacobs says. The minority leader\u2019s only leverage is to keep Republicans anxious that repeal and replace will take a long time, or won\u2019t happen at all, he explains.

The Patient Freedom Act (PFA) of 2017 would take power from Washington and return it to state capitols in order to increase access to affordable health insurance and improve patient choice, while preserving important consumer protections. This proposal empowers patients by eliminating costly and burdensome mandates, making enrollment easy, requiring price transparency, and restoring state authority to set rules for their health insurance markets and giving patients power to make their own health care decisions.  This proposal repeals burdensome federal mandates imposed by the Affordable Care Act, such as the individual mandate, the employer mandate, the actuarial value requirements that force plans to fit into one of four categories, the age band requirements that drive up costs for young people, and the benefit mandates that often force Americans to pay for coverage they don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford.

It also preserves guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability and allows young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 plan until age 26, as well as preserving coverage for mental health and substance use disorders.  The bill repeals Title I of the ACA (while retaining important consumer protections), and allows states to choose one of three options:  This proposal provides financial assistance to legal residents of the United States not receiving health insurance through their employer or public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The goal is to provide roughly the same federal benefit available to those who get insurance through their employer. To ensure that everyone is covered, States will be able to auto-enroll uninsured individuals in basic health care coverage unless that individual opts out.  The basic health plan would provide all eligible individuals with a Roth Health Savings Account, a high deductible health plan, and a basic pharmacy plan. Americans could purchase more robust coverage if they chose, and without the ACA\u2019s restrictive mandates, the options available would not only likely be more affordable, but individuals could pick among plans to find one that best suits their specific needs. The Patient Freedom Act would also establish new protections for those who need emergency care, by placing limits on out-of-network surcharges for emergency medical services paid for with an HSA. The proposal also requires providers to publish \u201ccash prices\u201d for services paid for with an HSA or with cash.  Each State will receive the same level of funding it would have received under the ACA if 95% of those eligible for subsidies enrolled. In addition, the State will receive the money that would have been paid for a Medicaid expansion. If states have already expanded Medicaid, the State can choose to keep the Medicaid expansion or convert that funding into subsidies to help individuals purchase private insurance. To help Americans access health insurance, States will establish a method for depositing funds for each person directly into that individual\u2019s Roth HSA, meaning health care dollars will go directly to the patient."},

The bill repeals Title I of the ACA (while retaining important consumer protections), and allows states to choose one of three options:  This proposal provides financial assistance to legal residents of the United States not receiving health insurance through their employer or public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The goal is to provide roughly the same federal benefit available to those who get insurance through their employer. To ensure that everyone is covered, States will be able to auto-enroll uninsured individuals in basic health care coverage unless that individual opts out.  The basic health plan would provide all eligible individuals with a Roth Health Savings Account, a high deductible health plan, and a basic pharmacy plan. Americans could purchase more robust coverage if they chose, and without the ACA\u2019s restrictive mandates, the options available would not only likely be more affordable, but individuals could pick among plans to find one that best suits their specific needs. The Patient Freedom Act would also establish new protections for those who need emergency care, by placing limits on out-of-network surcharges for emergency medical services paid for with an HSA. The proposal also requires providers to publish \u201ccash prices\u201d for services paid for with an HSA or with cash.  Each State will receive the same level of funding it would have received under the ACA if 95% of those eligible for subsidies enrolled. In addition, the State will receive the money that would have been paid for a Medicaid expansion. If states have already expanded Medicaid, the State can choose to keep the Medicaid expansion or convert that funding into subsidies to help individuals purchase private insurance. To help Americans access health insurance, States will establish a method for depositing funds for each person directly into that individual\u2019s Roth HSA, meaning health care dollars will go directly to the patient."},

According to the GAO, financial fraud targeting older Americans is a growing epidemic that costs seniors an estimated $2.9 billion annually. These scams range from the \u201cJamaican Lottery Scam,\u201d to the IRS impersonation scam, and as recently highlighted in a Senate Aging Committee hearing, the financial exploitation of seniors through guardianships. \u201cProtecting seniors from financial exploitation and fraud is one of the top priorities of the Aging Committee.

Without this, their schemes would fail,\u201d   \u201cI am very pleased to introduce this bipartisan legislation, based on Maine\u2019s innovative Senior$afe program, that will empower and encourage our financial service representatives to identify warning signs of common scams and help stop financial fraud targeting our seniors.\u201d \u201cIf we can better protect our seniors from fraudsters in some of the most vulnerable years of their lives, we should use every tool at our disposal to do so,\u201d   \u201cWe\u2019ve got to give financial professionals the ability to combat fraud when they see it\u2014while protecting the privacy of their customers\u2014so that no Missourian\u2019s life savings are at risk of exploitation.\u201d The Senior$afe Act is based on Maine\u2019s innovative Senior$afe program, a collaborative effort by Maine\u2019s regulators, financial institutions, and legal organizations to educate bank and credit union employees on how to identify and help stop financial exploitation of older Mainers. Last year, the Senate Aging Committee held a hearing examining programs on the state level that aim to stop financial exploitation of seniors. Included in this hearing was testimony from Jaye Martin, the Director of Maine\u2019s Legal Services for the Elderly. During the hearing, Chairman Collins asked Ms. Martin about the effectiveness of the Senior$afe program in fighting the financial exploitation of seniors in Maine.

{"title": "NYT Columnist Makes Strong Case for Cassidy-Collins Compromise", "date": ["Posted Wed, 01/25/2017 - 10:00"], "release": "By: Ross Douthat Modern conservatism, at least in its pre-Donald Trump incarnation, evolved to believe in a marriage of Edmund Burke and Milton Friedman, in which the wisdom of tradition and the wisdom of free markets were complementary ideas. Both, in their different ways, delivered a kind of bottom-up democratic wisdom \u2014 the first through the cumulative experiments of the human past, the second through the contemporary experiments enabled by choice and competition. In health care policy, however, conservatives tend to simply favor Friedman over Burke. That is, the right\u2019s best health care minds believe that markets and competition can deliver lower costs and better care, and they believe it even though there is no clear example of a modern health care system built along the lines that they desire. The dominant systems in the developed world, whether government-run or single-payer or Obamacare-esque, are generally statist to degrees that conservatives deplore. A few of them \u2014 notably Singapore\u2019s, the beau ideal of right-wing health care wonks \u2014 do have distinctive elements that conservatives favor. But mostly they tend to be much more heavily regulated and subsidized than the system that conservative health policy wonks and policy-literate Republicans would like to see take over from Obamacare. Which is not to say that the conservative health policy vision lacks empirical grounding. There is compelling evidence that markets in health care can do more to lower costs and prices than liberals allow, and good reasons to think that free-market competition produces more medical innovation than more socialized systems. But still \u2014 there is no existing system on a national scale that looks like the health care system that Paul Ryan or Tom Price would design, no wisdom of developed-economy experience that proves that such a system would actually keep overall costs low and prevent too many people from being shut out of insurance markets. So embracing even the smartest conservative Obamacare alternative requires a not-precisely-Burkean leap of faith. And this, in a nutshell, is why The essence of Cassidy-Collins, and the reason that many Republicans don\u2019t like it, is that it isn\u2019t actually a full Obamacare replacement.  That end would look like one of the more plausible conservative alternatives to Obamacare: a subsidy to cover the cost of a catastrophic health insurance plan, plus a directly funded health savings account to cover primary care. This system could be layered on top of the existing Medicaid expansion, replacing only the Obamacare subsidies and exchanges, or it could replace the Medicaid expansion as well, offering the poor and near poor the same \u201ccatastrophic insurance plus a subsidy\u201d as everyone else in the individual market. Either way the individual mandate would disappear, but people would be auto-enrolled in a catastrophic plan (with the option to opt out), meaning that coverage would be nearly universal (thus fulfilling one of President Trump\u2019s various promises) even though its benefits would be less comprehensive than Obamacare\u2019s. Taken as a whole, this approach distills both the promise and the peril of conservative health care policy.  The peril is that there would be too wide a gap between what the money in your health savings account covers and what you need before your catastrophic coverage kicks in. In which case many people with consistent health care costs for chronic problems would rack up impossible medical bills in short order. Conservatives who want this model to replace Obamacare nationwide believe that the promise outweighs the risk \u2014 and this is, again, a reasonable belief. But it\u2019s also a belief that hasn\u2019t been tested on any kind of sweeping, economy wide scale. And this is the advantage of Cassidy-Collins: It encourages governors and legislators to actually put the conservative theory of health care to the test without simply reversing the ideological colors of the great Obamacare experiment and immediately turning the entire United States health care system over to the right\u2019s technocratic vision. Of course this would mean that Obamacare\u2019s existing problems would persist in the states where it continues. But those problems \u2014 the rise in premiums, the fleeing insurers, the risk of a death spiral downstream \u2014 are not equally problematic in every state, and they are not fiscally dangerous, as yet, on the scale that many conservatives initially feared. As the conservative policy thinker Yuval Levin wrote late last year, the striking thing about Obamacare to date is how much smaller than expected its effect on the overall health care system has been. Fewer people are being insured on the exchanges than liberals hoped, fewer employers are dumping high-cost employees onto the exchanges than conservatives feared, and as a result, he writes:  That system may not survive, and its condition has a lot to teach us about the problems with liberal health economics. But it is a much smaller system than anyone thought it would be at this point, about half the size that C.B.O. projected, so that the effects of any failure it suffers are likely to be more contained than anyone might have expected. This containment means that conservatives have room and time to be more patient, cautious and experimental than were the Obama Democrats before them. If the Obamacare exchanges aren\u2019t ultimately going to work out, then allowing them to persist in liberal states while an alternative system gets set up in red states is a reasonable way to gradually transition from the liberal model toward the conservative one. If the right\u2019s wonks are right about health policy, the Cassidy-Collins approach should \u2014 gradually \u2014 enable conservatives to prove it. And if the right is wrong, if its model doesn\u2019t match reality, if people are simply miserable as health care consumers because the system has too much of Friedman and not enough of Burke \u2014 well, in that case both the country and conservatism will be better off if we learn that via a voter rebellion in 10 right-leaning states, rather than through a much more widespread backlash against a nationwide health-insurance failure. (Which is something a president with a high self-regard and poor approval ratings might have a particular reason to avoid.) Between this reasonable case and legislative reality, of course, falls a variety of shadows. But more than for the various repeal-and-replace alternatives? I\u2019m not so sure. Right now the Cassidy-Collins compromise has few enthusiastic backers.  Click   to read Ross Douthat\u2019s column"},

The Patient Freedom Act (PFA) of 2017 would take power from Washington and return it to state capitols in order to increase access to affordable health insurance and improve patient choice, while preserving important consumer protections. This proposal empowers patients by eliminating costly and burdensome mandates, making enrollment easy, requiring price transparency, and restoring state authority to set rules for their health insurance markets and giving patients power to make their own health care decisions.  This proposal repeals burdensome federal mandates imposed by the Affordable Care Act, such as the individual mandate, the employer mandate, the actuarial value requirements that force plans to fit into one of four categories, the age band requirements that drive up costs for young people, and the benefit mandates that often force Americans to pay for coverage they don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford.

The bill repeals Title I of the ACA (while retaining important consumer protections), and allows states to choose one of three options: 1.  : Option 1 allows the State to reinstate Title I of the ACA, including its mandates and other requirements. The State can continue to receive federal premium tax credits, cost-sharing subsidies, and Medicaid dollars, to the extent that such subsidies do not exceed the contributions that would have been made under Option 2. 2.  : Option 2 allows the State to enact a new market-based system that empowers patients while still ensuring those with pre-existing conditions are protected. The State could continue to receive funding equal to 95% of federal premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies, as well as the federal match for Medicaid expansion. States can choose to receive funds in the form of per beneficiary grants or advanceable, refundable tax credits, but in both cases, funds will be deposited in a Roth Health Savings Account (HSA), meaning the money will go directly to the patient. 3.  : Option 3 would return power to the States to design and regulate insurance markets that work for their specific populations, without any federal assistance.  This proposal provides financial assistance to legal residents of the United States not receiving health insurance through their employer or public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The goal is to provide roughly the same federal benefit available to those who get insurance through their employer.

{"title": "Sens. Collins, Warner Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Authorize Delayed VA Medical Leases ", "date": ["Posted Wed, 01/25/2017 - 13:43"], "release": " \u2014 U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Mark R. Warner (D-VA) led a bipartisan group of 15 Senators, including Senator Angus King (I-ME), to reintroduce the bipartisan Providing Veterans Overdue Care Act. The legislation would authorize pending leases for 24 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities, the majority of which have been awaiting Congressional approval for more than a year. These medical facilities\u2014located in 15 states, including Maine\u2014are necessary to improve veterans\u2019 access to vital health care services. Under law, the VA must receive specific legislative authorization to lease medical facilities with average annual rental payments in excess of $1 million. However, since 2012, Congress has not, through a regular process, authorized any major VA medical facility leases, hampering the ability of the department to provide much-needed health care and services to veterans around the country. The 24 leases pending before Congress are located in states with an estimated 11 million veterans. \u201cVeterans deserve convenient access to the high-quality health care they have earned through their service. That is why I continue to urge my colleagues to support the authorization of these leases for vital medical facilities across the country, including in Portland, ME,\u201d   \u201cThese facilities, such as the proposed CBOC in Portland, will allow veterans to receive outpatient care without the stress and difficulty of traveling to larger VA medical centers, which may be located far away from their homes.\u201d \u201cDespite progress the VA has made in recent years to improve access, too many veterans in Virginia and across the country are still waiting too long to get medical care through the VA. While we have been able to reduce waiting times in the Hampton Roads region, we have a larger challenge ahead as the veteran population in the area grows at roughly four times the national average,\u201d   \u201cVeterans deserve a new outpatient facility in South Hampton Roads to help ease some of the burden at Hampton VAMC, and Congress needs to make the approval of these two dozen pending leases a top priority. Our veterans expect better from us, and this bill is a good step in the effort to improve veteran\u2019s access to the services they have earned through their service to this country.\u201d \u201cMaine veterans have fought to preserve the freedom and liberties that we cherish every day. They shouldn\u2019t also have to fight for access to quality and convenient health care,\u201d   \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s unacceptable to me that important facilities like the proposed Portland CBOC remain unauthorized, especially when there are so many veterans in need. I will continue to work with my colleagues to see that these facilities are authorized and that Maine veterans are able to receive the care they not only need, but have earned.\u201d One reason for the delay in congressional authorization has been a recent change in the way that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scores these leases. Prior to 2012, the major medical facility leases were scored on an annual basis, but that year, CBO determined that budget authority for these leases, many of which cover a 20-year period, should be recorded up front when the leases are initiated and the acquisition occurs, not when the debt is repaid. As such, scoring for legislation that authorized these leases increased significantly, even though actual spending would not increase and the leases are ultimately subject to annual appropriations. The Providing Veterans Overdue Care Act was previously   by Senators Collins and Warner in the 114th Congress. The proposed CBOC in Portland would consolidate the existing Saco and Portland CBOCs and enhance VA outpatient services. The lease would increase veterans\u2019 access to a core set of services and additional specialty care in a state-of-the-art, energy efficient health care facility in the Portland area. The planned full deployment of tele-medicine technologies in the new clinic would further improve veterans\u2019 access to care in rural locations throughout Maine. Although   for the proposed Portland CBOC last year, it cannot move forward without authorization. The bill would authorize the following leases: \u2022 Ann Arbor, MI - Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Birmingham, AL - Outpatient Mental Health Clinic \u2022 Birmingham, AL - Outpatient Specialty Clinic \u2022 Boston, MA \u2013 Research Space \u2022 Charleston, SC \u2013 Research Space \u2022 Corpus Christi, TX \u2013 Replacement Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Daytona Beach, FL - Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Denver, CO - Chief Business Office Purchased Care \u2022 Gainesville, FL - Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Hampton Roads, VA - Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Jacksonville, FL \u2013 Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Mission Bay, CA \u2013 Research Space \u2022 Missoula, MT - Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Northern Colorado, CO - Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Ocala, FL - Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Oxnard, CA - Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Pike County, GA - Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Pontiac, MI \u2013 Outpatient Clinic \u2022  \u2022 Raleigh, NC - Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Rochester, NY \u2013 Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Santa Rosa, CA - Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Tampa, FL \u2013 Outpatient Clinic \u2022 Terre Haute, IN \u2013 Outpatient Clinic In addition to Sens.

The signing of the Letter of Intent marks one of the first steps in implementing the recommendations offered by the federal Economic Development Assessment Team, which was created   of Senators King and Susan Collins in March 2016 to support the state\u2019s forest products industry. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe University of Maine and Oak Ridge National Laboratory are world-class research institutions, and the collaborative, innovative partnership established today will leverage their collective knowledge and expertise to advance opportunities that will attract biobased industries and grow Maine\u2019s forest economy,\u201d  . \u201cThis is both a welcome and encouraging step forward for all those who call our beautiful state home and particularly for those who work in our forest economy. I am hopeful that it will be the first of many to come that will lead to job creation and economic growth across rural Maine.\u201d \u201cThe partnership announced between UMaine and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory is a testament to the many innovations that have already been achieved by UMaine and will accelerate the promising research of using forest-based biomaterials and composites in advanced manufacturing applications,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cToday\u2019s announcement fulfills one of the recommendations of the Economic Development Assessment Team Senator King and I requested to help grow the economy and create jobs in rural Maine communities, and it represents another important milestone in our efforts to strengthen the forest products industry.\u201d Before the Letter of Intent was signed today, Senator King received a private briefing from officials with the Department of Energy\u2019s Advanced Manufacturing Office, ORNL, and UMaine about the partnership. Senator Collins attended the briefing via Skype. Following the tour, Senator King toured the Alfond Advanced Manufacturing Lab for Structural Thermoplastics. To text of the Letter of Intent is as follows: +++ This Letter of Intent memorializes the intention of ORNL and UMaine, but does not create any legally binding obligations.\u00a0 The formation of a formal Partnership and/or any commitment of funds, protection and allocation of intellectual property rights, disclosure of proprietary information, or commitment of other resources is to be made under a separate agreement between the parties, subject to approval by the U.S. Department of Energy."},

Her instinct is shared by lawmakers in states with particularly fragile insurance markets like Tennessee and Alaska\u2026\u201d  | Joe Lawlor\u00a0 \u201cHealth policy analysts say an Affordable Care Act replacement plan introduced by Maine Sen. Susan Collins this week could contain the seeds for a deal that would bridge the gap between the extensive benefits required under the ACA and skimpier proposals previously offered by congressional Republicans\u2026\u201d \u201c...Under Collins\u2019 bill, the government would deposit taxpayer money into accounts of previously uninsured individuals \u2013 an undisclosed amount but expected to be several thousand dollars a year \u2013 and that money could be used to pay for a standard high-deductible plan or to help purchase more comprehensive coverage. Everyone who was previously uninsured and can\u2019t get coverage from an employer or Medicare would automatically be enrolled in the standard health plan, with an HSA set up for them that would contain taxpayer-funded money they could use to pay for health care. \u201cIndividuals would receive the taxpayer-funded deposits if they earned up to $90,000, or $150,000 for a married couple. After the income thresholds are reached, the assistance would be gradually reduced. \u201cThough the standard plan and other plans purchased through the Patient Freedom Act would not be required to cover everything that\u2019s currently mandated by the Affordable Care Act, many of the ACA\u2019s provisions would remain. \u201cFor instance, the Patient Freedom Act mandates that most plans \u2013 even those purchased with HSA money \u2013 must carry the same preventive services as the ACA at little or no cost to patients. \u201cSo the plans would still offer free colonoscopies, mammograms, immunizations, annual checkups, birth control, tests for a variety of diseases such as diabetes, hepatitis A and B, and sexually transmitted diseases, tobacco cessation programs and other mandated, preventive services. \u201cAlso, the HSA-purchased plans, like the Affordable Care Act, must include mental health and substance use disorder services.

Senators Collins and Heitkamp\u2019s Stop, Observe, Ask and Respond (SOAR) to Health and Wellness Act would provide health care workers across the country with needed training on how to recognize, report, and potentially intervene when they see patients who are possible human trafficking victims. Recent studies suggest that   of women trafficked in America saw a health care professional while they were still captive to these crimes and that   of human trafficking could help make sure victims receive resources and services to get the protection and care they need. \u201cEvery state in America is affected by the evils of sex trafficking. Human traffickers prey upon the most vulnerable, often homeless or runaway children. Identification is the first, and frequently missed, step in helping victims and stopping these atrocities,\u201d   \u201cThis bipartisan legislation would bolster the current success of the U.S. Health and Human Services pilot program by expanding it and greatly increasing the number of our health care providers who will have the training to protect victims and expose these heinous crimes.\u201d \u201cThis month when I spoke with a mother whose young daughter was terrorized on a near daily basis after being trafficked for sex, I asked her what she thought needed to change going forward.

Madam\u00a0President, this is not a decision that I\u2019ve made lightly. I have a great deal of respect for Mrs. DeVos. I believe that she is a good person. I know that she cares deeply about the children of this nation. But for the reasons that I will explain, I simply cannot support her confirmation. \u201cMadam\u00a0President, later today the Senate will vote on a motion to proceed to the DeVos nomination. I will vote to proceed to the nomination because I believe that Presidents are entitled to considerable deference in the selection of Cabinet members, regardless of which political party is in power, and that each and every Senator should have the right to cast his or her vote on nominees for the cabinet. That is why during President Obama\u2019s administration, I voted for procedural motions to allow the President\u2019s nominees for Secretary of Defense and for Secretary of Labor to receive up-or-down votes by the full Senate, even though I ultimately voted against those two nominees on the Senate floor. \u201cAt the time, Madam\u00a0President, I stated that it is appropriate for every Senator to have an opportunity to vote for or against an individual Cabinet member, and I still believe that that is the right approach. \u201cNow let me again make clear what I said at the beginning of my remarks and which explains why this has been a decision that I\u2019ve not made lightly. I know that Mrs. DeVos cares deeply about children. I recognize that she has devoted much time and resources to try to improve the education of at-risk children in cities whose public schools have failed them, and I commend her for those efforts. \u201cI wrote to Mrs. DeVos, seeking her assurances in writing, that she would not support any federal legislation mandating that states adopt vouchers, nor would she condition federal funding on the presence of voucher programs in states. She has provided that commitment, and I would ask unanimous consent that the exchange of correspondence with Mrs. DeVos be entered into the record at the conclusion of my statement. \u201cNevertheless, Madam\u00a0President, like all of us, Mrs. DeVos is the product of her experience. She appears to view education through the lens of her experience in promoting alternatives to public education in Detroit and other cities where she has, no doubt, done valuable work. Her concentration on charter schools and vouchers, however, raises the question of whether or not she fully appreciates that the Secretary of Education\u2019s primary focus must be on helping states and communities, parents, teachers, school board members, and administrators strengthen our public schools. \u201cWhile it is unrealistic and unfair to expect a nominee to know the details of all the programs under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education, I am troubled and surprised by Mrs. DeVos\u2019 apparent lack of familiarity with the landmark 1975 law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA, that guarantees a free and appropriate education to children with special needs. \u201cThe mission of the Department of Education is broad, but supporting public education is at its core. I am concerned that Mrs. DeVos\u2019 lack of experience with public schools will make it difficult for her to fully understand, identify, and assist with those challenges, particularly for our rural schools in states like Maine. \u201cIn keeping with my past practice, I will vote today to proceed to debate on Mrs. DeVos\u2019 nomination, but, Madam\u00a0President, I will not, I cannot vote to confirm her as our nation\u2019s next Secretary of Education. \u201cMadam President, I yield the floor.\""},

Our legislation would create a strong disincentive for companies that act more like hedge funds to drive up the prices of drugs they did nothing to develop just because, as one executive essentially said, \u2018because I can.\u2019\u201d \u201cToo many folks are struggling with the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs, and we can take some commonsense steps to help alleviate that burden\u201d   \u201cIf we incentivize competition and fast-track new drug approvals, we can bring down costs to make these lifesaving drugs more affordable for the thousands of Missourians who depend on them.\u201d This legislation stems from the only bipartisan investigation into the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to the egregious price spikes for certain drugs, which was led by Senators Collins and McCaskill last Congress. The Aging Committee held the first in a series of hearings in December 2015. From the beginning, the investigation strived to understand why companies can make these large price increases and to identify which policies should be considered to counter these disturbing practices. For many decades, federal policy has sought to strike the right balance between maintaining the incentives needed to promote innovation and the development of new drugs and keeping medicines affordable. Once patent protections for medications expire, generic drugs approved by the FDA help establish competitive markets for treatments that improve the lives of millions of American patients. Eighty-eight percent of drugs purchased are generics, which has amounted to $1.7 trillion in estimated savings. In general, this balance works well; however, the Committee\u2019s investigation revealed that some older drugs lack an FDA-approved generic competitor. This lack of competition is a significant contributing factor that can allow companies to acquire and sharply increase the cost of these older drugs that are no longer protected by patents. The Increasing Competition in Pharmaceuticals Act aims to help address this issue by improving the FDA\u2019s approval process for certain generic applications. By promoting competition in the generic drug marketplace, the Collins-McCaskill legislation will help lower the cost and improve the accessibility of decades-old prescription drugs. Among other provisions, Senators Collins and McCaskill\u2019s legislation will establish a clear timeframe for the FDA to expedite the review of certain applications for generic drugs; direct the FDA to report quarterly to Congress on the number of new drug applications filed for review prior to October 1, 2015; and create a new \u201cgeneric priority review voucher\u201d that would be awarded to the sponsor of a successful application for a medical shortage or sole-source drug that makes it to market. By authorizing a priority review framework for generic applications and increasing transparency in the review process, the Increasing Competition in Pharmaceuticals Act will help alleviate future shortages, increase competition to lower prices and avoid monopolies, and deter practices that can lead to exorbitant price hikes on drugs that were previously affordable to patients for decades."},

Experts have stated that $2 billion per year in federal funding is required to meet the goal of preventing or effectively treating Alzheimer\u2019s by 2025. In 2015, Congress approved a $350 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s disease research, the largest ever increase for Alzheimer\u2019s research funding. Senators Collins and Klobuchar\u2019s letter was also signed by Senators Jerry Moran (R-KS), Ed Markey (D-MA), John Boozman (R-AR), Mark Warner (D-VA), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), and Bob Casey (D-PA). To view a signed PDF of the letter, click  The President The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: Alzheimer\u2019s is a devastating disease that exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on the individual, the family, and our society. In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer\u2019s is our nation\u2019s most expensive disease, costing the United States more than $236 billion a year, including $160 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid. These costs will skyrocket as the baby boom generation ages. Alzheimer\u2019s is also one of our nation\u2019s leading causes of death, with recent data revealing that each year more than 500,000 deaths are attributable to Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias \u2013 six times the amount previously estimated. Moreover, Alzheimer\u2019s is the only one of our nation\u2019s deadliest diseases without an effective means of prevention, treatment, or cure. If nothing is done to change the trajectory of Alzheimer\u2019s, the number of Americans afflicted with the disease is expected to more than triple by 2050. Already our nation\u2019s costliest disease, Alzheimer\u2019s is projected to cost our country more than $1 trillion by 2050. At a time when the United States is spending more than $200 billion a year to care for Alzheimer\u2019s patients, we are spending just four percent of that amount on research. Although the Administration and Congress have made some progress in increasing funding, Alzheimer\u2019s research funding remains disproportionately low compared to its human and economic toll. Indeed, similarly deadly diseases receive annual funding of $2 billion, $3 billion, and even $5.6 billion for research, which has paid dividends. Given the tremendous human and economic price of this devastating disease, we can do more for Alzheimer\u2019s. Investments in research for other diseases have yielded tremendous results: patients have access to new treatments, and death rates for some diseases are decreasing. Yet, at the same time, mortality due to Alzheimer\u2019s is escalating dramatically. Fortunately, there is promising research that holds hope for Alzheimer\u2019s patients and their families. The research community is poised to make important advances through clinical trials and investigating new therapeutic targets, but adequate funding is critical to advance this research. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, which was authorized by the bipartisan 2010 National Alzheimer\u2019s Project Act, has as its primary goal to \u201cprevent and effectively treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease by 2025.\u201d To meet that goal, the Chairman of the Advisory Council created by the legislation says that we will need to devote $2 billion a year to Alzheimer\u2019s research. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 took a major step forward by providing a $350 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s disease research funding, the largest increase for Alzheimer\u2019s research funding in history. Congress has recently taken additional steps to fight Alzheimer's with the enactment of the 21st Century Cures Act, which provides additional funding for the BRAIN Initiative and creates the breakthrough EUREKA prize competition to address pressing diseases, including Alzheimer's. These are critical achievements, but we need to do more. Increasing federal funding for Alzheimer\u2019s research would be a wise investment. We, therefore, urge you to boost our current investment in Alzheimer\u2019s research in your fiscal year 2018 budget request and support efforts to meet the research investment objective set forth in the National Plan. We remain committed to finding a way to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer\u2019s by 2025, and we look forward to working with you to meet that goal."},
{"title": "Progress in the Fight to Protect Children and Families from Lead Poisoning ", "date": ["Posted Mon, 02/06/2017 - 10:44"], "release": "Lead poisoning poses a severe threat to human health, especially to children and pregnant women. Lead, in both paint and plumbing, is a particularly serious problem here in Maine and throughout New England, where our housing stock is older than in most other states. A new rule by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that took effect this month will better protect children living in subsidized housing from harmful lead exposure. I strongly advocated for this change that continues our nation\u2019s decades-long effort to address this serious public health and environmental threat. Nearly 40 years ago, in 1978, the federal government took an important first step by banning the manufacture of lead paint for residential use. Maine children, however, remain at a high risk for lead poisoning because more than 60 percent of our state\u2019s homes were built prior to 1978. Furthermore, homes that were built before 1950 have the highest lead concentration in their paint. Children may become exposed to lead by eating paint chips, but exposure from paint is most harmful when dust is inhaled from flaking or peeling lead-based paints. Even relatively low levels of lead exposure can cause reading and learning disabilities, hyperactivity, behavioral problems, and reductions in IQ and attention span, all of which can threaten a child\u2019s ability to achieve his or her full potential. I have worked to raise awareness and secure important investments to help protect our children and families from this dangerous and too often unseen problem. In 1999, during my first term in office, I held a field hearing on lead poisoning in Lewiston. Since that time, I have strongly advocated for increased funding for programs to address lead abatement, such as the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction program. As Chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, I have successfully secured robust funding for this important program. Lead poisoning presents an even greater threat to low-income families that do not have the resources to pursue costly lead abatement programs. It is estimated that 128,000 HUD-assisted housing units across the country have lead-based paint and have children under age six residing in them. Yet, despite the growing evidence of the harm caused to children by lead exposure, HUD\u2019s regulations on acceptable lead blood levels had not been updated since 1999. This obsolete standard allowed for the lead in children\u2019s blood to be up to four times higher than the level recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) before requiring action to address lead hazards in public and assisted housing. Last year, I joined with Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island in writing to HUD Secretary Julian Castro, urging him to expedite his department\u2019s work to update the HUD regulations to meet the CDC standard. The new standard lowers HUD\u2019s acceptable threshold of lead in children\u2019s blood from 20 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood to five, which will help protect countless children from the harmful, often permanent effects of lead poisoning. In addition to that bipartisan advocacy, I secured language in the fiscal year 2017 THUD Appropriations bill, which was approved by the full Senate by a vote of 89-8, that required HUD to lower its threshold to match the CDC\u2019s. That bill also contained several important lead-related provisions in addition to the blood-level regulation, including additional funding to provide safer homes for thousands of additional low-income families. At least 4 million American households have children that are being exposed to high levels of lead. Despite our efforts to fight this largely preventable health problem, lead poisoning remains one of the most prevalent environmental health challenges facing children today. We must continue our efforts to eradicate this health threat."},

The resolution calls on the Senate to double the amount of funding the U.S. spends on Alzheimer\u2019s in fiscal year 2017 and develop a plan to meet the target of $2 billion per year in funding as recommended by experts to meet the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer\u2019s by 2025.

Seventy percent of lead poisonings are a result of dust exposure from lead-based paint in the home, and children, especially those living at or below the poverty line that reside in older homes, are at risk of long-term neurological harm, including reduced IQ, behavioral changes, and reduced educational attainment. \u201cSince the beginning of my Senate service, I have worked to raise awareness and secure funding to address lead-based hazards, which remain one of the most prevalent health issues facing children today,\u201d   \u201cOnce completed, this GAO report will improve our understanding of the gaps in HUD\u2019s enforcement of lead-based paint regulations and enhance our efforts to eradicate this largely preventable health problem.\u201d \u201cProtecting children from lead poisoning must be a national priority. HUD must ensure that children living in assisted housing are protected and that their programs are effective in addressing this problem,\u201d   \u201cThis study by GAO will help us better understand how well HUD\u2019s current programs are working and provide invaluable insight into how to achieve better health outcomes from current programs, close gaps in regulations, increase coordination among federal, state, and local partners, and improve the use of resources to ensure that more children are helped with every dollar spent.\u201d \u201cI am pleased to join my appropriations colleagues in requesting this report from the GAO. Lead-based paint continues to pose a hazard to children across the country, and the recent accounts of toxic paint in HUD-assisted housing are alarming. Lead-based paint poisoning is preventable, and it is vital that we as policymakers gain critical information about the best and most effective uses of federal funding to combat this issue,\u201d  \u201cLead-based paint hazards in HUD-assisted housing pose a grave threat to the health of vulnerable individuals, especially children. I hope that the GAO will conduct a thorough and comprehensive audit that will help inform our continued efforts to address lead hazards,\u201d  The Senate and House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) oversees funding for federal housing programs. A version of this study was included in fiscal year 2017 report language by both the Senate and House THUD Appropriations subcommittees.

The legislation would authorize grants to public and non-profit organizations that improve caregiver health and allow patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias to stay in their homes longer.\u00a0 \u201cToday, there are nearly 16 million Americans who devote enormous time and attention and make many personal and financial sacrifices to ensure that their loved ones have the high-quality care they need day in and day out. These individuals know all too well the compassion, commitment, and endurance that it takes to be a caregiver of a loved one with Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d   \u201cOur bipartisan legislation would help expand the availability of resources and training services to provide caregivers with the support they need.\u201d \u201cJust as our nation addressed the needs of working mom and dads in the 1970s, we must now address the needs of the nearly 16 million Americans who are caring for a loved one living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or a related dementia. These loving caregivers provide nearly 18 billion hours of unpaid care annually with little training and support,\u201d   \u201cThat\u2019s why Senator Collins and I introduced this bipartisan bill to expand training and support services for caregivers to improve their health and well-being. It will also help caregivers provide better care for their patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or a related dementia, allowing patients to stay in the comfort of their homes longer.\u201d As the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee and the founder and co-chair of the Senate Alzheimer\u2019s Task Force, working to support caregivers and increase federal funding for biomedical research are among Senator Collins\u2019 top priorities. In 2011, Senator Collins introduced the National Alzheimer\u2019s Project Act with then-Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN). That law convened a panel of experts, who determined that $2 billion per year in research funding is needed to achieve our goal of preventing and treating Alzheimer\u2019s by the year 2025. In 2015, following Senator Collins\u2019 strong advocacy, Congress approved a $350 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s disease research, the largest ever increase for Alzheimer\u2019s research funding and bringing total funding nearly halfway to the $2 billion goal. Earlier this week, Senators Collins and Klobuchar   declaring that the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer\u2019s by 2025 is an \u201curgent national priority.\u201d In addition, last week, the Senators   to the President calling for greater investment in Alzheimer\u2019s research. More than five million Americans, including 37,000 in Maine, are currently living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and by 2050, that number is expected to grow to 14 million. Caregivers of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias, who number nearly 16 million, report higher levels of stress and depression than those who provide care to individuals without dementia, which resulted in $10.2 billion in additional health costs for Alzheimer\u2019s caregivers in 2015."},

The new rule, which went into effect today, will lower HUD\u2019s acceptable blood lead level to match the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) recommended threshold. This will allow for an earlier lead abatement response when children living in subsidized housing are exposed to lead-based paint hazards. U.S. Senator Susan Collins, the Chairman of the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, has strongly pushed for this change. \u201cI am pleased that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has updated its blood lead threshold, a change I have long advocated for, which will help protect countless children from the harmful, often permanent effects of lead poisoning,\u201d   \u201cSince the beginning of my Senate service, I have worked to raise awareness and secure funding to address this largely preventable health problem, which remains one of the most prevalent environmental issues facing children today. We must continue our efforts to eradicate this health threat.\u201d HUD regulations have not been updated since 1999, and had allowed for the lead in children\u2019s blood to be up to four times higher than the CDC-recommended level before requiring action to address lead hazards in public and assisted housing. The new standard would lower HUD\u2019s threshold of lead in children\u2019s blood from 20 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (\u00b5g/dL) to five. The proposed rule will potentially cover 2.9 million HUD-assisted housing units, of which 128,000 are estimated to contain lead-based paint and have children under age six residing in them. In 2016, Senator Collins and Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) wrote to HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, urging him to expedite HUD\u2019s regulatory action to adopt the blood lead levels currently advised by the CDC. In addition, Senator Collins secured language in the fiscal year 2017 THUD Appropriations bill, which was approved by the full Senate by a vote of 89-8, that would have required HUD to lower its threshold to match the CDC\u2019s. Even relatively low levels of lead exposure can cause reading and learning disabilities, hyperactivity, behavioral problems, and reductions in IQ and attention span, all of which can threaten a child\u2019s ability to achieve his or her full potential. In 1999, during Senator Collins first term in office, she held a field hearing on lead poisoning in Lewiston. Since that time, she has championed increased funding for programs to address lead abatement."},

The additional time would allow Congress and the Administration to develop a serious replacement to Obamacare that would protect Americans from losing their health insurance coverage and avoid turmoil in the insurance industry. \u201cIn an ideal situation, we would repeal and replace Obamacare simultaneously, but we need to make sure that we have at least a detailed framework that tells the American people what direction we're headed,\u201d   \u201cRepeal and replacement is a complicated task, and my number one concern is that we not create a gap in coverage for individuals who are currently insured and who rely on that coverage.

While we have urged the Veterans Health Administration to take immediate action to fill these vacancies, we are concerned that if they remain unfilled during the transition to the new Administration, a hiring freeze would only continue to prevent veterans from receiving these vital services. In your Ten Point Plan for the VA, you advocate for increased mental health care professionals.\u00a0 We deeply hope and urge you to keep the following mental health-related staffing inadequacies, and the needs of Maine Veterans, in mind as you evaluate the scope of your hiring freeze: Again, we believe that a continuation of these vacancies due to a proposed federal civilian hiring freeze would not be in the best interests of Maine veterans, who served their country in uniform and deserve unencumbered access to the highest quality of care.

Pompeo acknowledged the need for Congress and the next administration to work together to strengthen our nation\u2019s cyber security, and he recognized Senator Collins\u2019 efforts on this issue. \u201cSenator, we've got lots of work to do,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cI know you've done a great deal of work in making sure that the national infrastructure, including its private sector infrastructure, has the capacity to do what it needs to keep not only business issues in the place that they need to be\u2026but [also] private companies that have important information about America\u2019s national security activities.\u201d \u201cThere is no reason to expect that this threat is going to diminish, and that will take a whole government effort to do that, shared by the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch, to achieve better cybersecurity for the national infrastructure as well,\u201d  Last year Senator Collins authored a provision for the Fiscal Year 2017 Intelligence Authorization Act that would require the Intelligence Community to participate in a voluntary program to provide assistance and support to the critical infrastructure entities at greatest risk of cyber attack.\u00a0 In addition, in 2012, Senator Collins and then-Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) introduced a cybersecurity bill that would have helped secure computer systems that oversee critical infrastructure."},

{"title": "Senators Collins, Cassidy to Introduce ACA Replacement Plan to Expand Choices, Lower Health Care Costs", "date": ["Posted Tue, 01/17/2017 - 18:16"], "release": " \u2014 U.S. Senator Susan Collins spoke from the Senate floor this afternoon to discuss an Affordable Care Act (ACA) replacement plan that she will introduce with Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) next Monday. Their replacement plan, The Patient Freedom Act of 2017, would increase choice and access to affordable health care.\u00a0 \u201cThere has been much debate lately on the best approach to replacing and reforming the Affordable Care Act,\u201d  \u201cSome of my colleagues have argued for immediate repeal without any replacement, an option that I reject for it risks leaving millions of vulnerable Americans without affordable health insurance and would undo important consumer protections provided by current law. Others have proposed repeal with the delayed effective date of two or three years to allow time for the Senate to devise legislation that would provide a better approach to health insurance. My concern with the repeal and delay plan is that the Obamacare exchanges, already on very shaky financial grounds, would go into a death spiral as consumers would face uncertainty and insurers would have no basis for pricing their policies.\u201d \u201cI'm pleased to see a growing consensus among members of both the Senate and the House that we must repair the ACA and provide reforms at nearly the same time that we repeal the law in order to protect families who rely on the program and to give insurers time to transition to a new marketplace that is based on more choices for consumers.\u201d \u201cIn 2015, I joined Senator Cassidy in introducing a more comprehensive and creative approach, the Patient Freedom Act. This is the basis for the legislation we are going to be introducing soon and would allow states to have more choices. If they like the Affordable Care Act, they can keep the Affordable Care Act. If they want to go an alternative route that is more patient centered, that would provide more choices and help to restrain costs, they could do that too and the federal government would bundle the funding that would otherwise be used for the ACA subsidies and expansion of Medicaid in their state and allow them to proceed along a more creative route. \u201cWe recognize how different the needs of our states are, but our citizens should have access to affordable health care and to choose the path that works best for them. We'll be talking more about the specifics of our bill when we introduce it, but I'm excited about this approach. I'm not saying that it's perfect, but it's important that we put specific proposals on the table that our colleagues can coalesce around, debate, and refine so that we can move ahead and remove the fear and uncertainty of families who are relying on coverage through the exchanges without putting an undue burden on the employers who create jobs in this country.\u201d"},

AMI, a high-tech textile production company based in Auburn, is in the process of pursuing a trade case against Chinese producers for selling unfairly subsidized industrial grade amorphous silica fabric (ASF) in the United States at less than fair value \u2013 putting the leading domestic producer of ASF, Auburn Manufacturing, at a significant disadvantage and threatening American jobs. \u201cAuburn Manufacturing, Inc. is the largest American producer of industrial grade amorphous silica fabric (ASF) and accounts for well over half of such fabric produced in the United States,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cUnfortunately, unfair and illegal subsidy practices by Chinese central, provincial, and local governments, as well as dumping practices by Chinese ASF producers, are harming the hard working men and women at Auburn Manufacturing.\u00a0 United States trade laws are designed to protect against the type of unfair competition specified in Auburn Manufacturing\u2019s antidumping and countervailing duty petition, and I support enforcement of these trade laws to protect Maine workers.\u201d \u201cI am testifying today in strong support of Auburn Manufacturing, its employees, and the importance of a robust trade enforcement system that works for U.S. companies both large and small,\u201d   \u201cSmall businesses that play by the rules and that work hard to keep good-paying manufacturing jobs in the country ought to be better supported by our trade enforcement agencies. When our trading partners choose to violate agreed-upon rules, placing U.S. businesses at an unfair competitive disadvantage, we need to be able to respond swiftly and decisively. [\u2026] If the Commission makes an affirmative final determination of material injury to AMI due to illegally subsidized and dumped Chinese imports, then I believe China essentially stole those jobs from Maine.\u201d \u201cAuburn Manufacturing, its hard working and skilled industrial weavers, and its high-tech fabric product are proud parts of Maine\u2019s manufacturing economy and important ingredients in our national defense,\u201d  . \u201cCompanies like Auburn Manufacturing give us hope. They are a bright spot in American manufacturing \u2013 in Maine manufacturing. They produce a world-class proprietary product and they play-by-the-rules. And, in doing so, AMI supports 40 good-paying career jobs with benefits. [\u2026] I ask you today to do what\u2019s right, to do what\u2019s fair, and to conclude that the Chinese Government subsidies are illegal and that they caused material injury to this American industry.\u201d Led by owner Kathie Leonard, AMI has pushed back against the rise in unfairly traded imports of ASF from China. Silica fabric is a heat-resistant material. \u00a0 The ITC has already made an initial determination that there is a \u201creasonable indication\u201d that U.S. producers have been \u201cmaterially injured\u201d by the importation of unfairly subsidized silica fiber from China. That determination in March 2016 paved the way for the investigation to continue, which led to today\u2019s hearing. If the ITC makes an affirmative final determination of material injury to AMI due to illegally subsidized and dumped Chinese imports, then the Secretary of Commerce would issue an antidumping order and a countervailing duty order.

Through close examination of the monopoly business model used by four pharmaceutical companies to exploit market failures, the report examines how companies acquired decades-old, off-patent, and previously affordable drugs and then raised the prices suddenly and astronomically at the expense of patients. The report provides case studies of the four companies; explores the influence of investors; assesses the impacts of price hikes on patients, payers, providers, hospitals, and the government; and discusses potential policy responses.\u00a0 \"The skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs affect every American family, particularly our seniors,\"   \"This report is the culmination of the Senate Aging Committee's year-long, bipartisan investigation into the egregious price increases on a number of decades-old drugs acquired by pharmaceutical companies that act more like hedge funds.

{"title": "Countering Boko Haram: Senator Collins\u2019 Legislation to Combat This Ruthless Terrorist Organization Becomes Law", "date": ["Posted Tue, 12/27/2016 - 09:19"], "release": "In 2014, the terrorist group Boko Haram shocked the world by kidnapping 276 Nigerian schoolgirls, sending them into lives of sexual slavery and forced \u201cmarriages.\u201d That horrific act was part of a nearly decade-long campaign of brutal violence by the extremist organization against the people of Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, and Niger in West and Central Africa. Last year, in response to the horrific kidnapping, I led all 20 women of the United States Senate in urging Secretary of State John Kerry to seek Boko Haram\u2019s addition to the United Nation\u2019s ISIL & Al-Qaida Sanctions List. Subsequently, the United Nations Security Council voted to subject Boko Haram to a complete asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo. This crucial vote followed a Global Terrorism Index Report finding that Boko Haram killed 6,664 people in 2014, more than the Islamic State. As this Congress comes to a close, our nation has taken stronger steps to stop the spread of Boko Haram. In September 2015, the Senate unanimously passed bipartisan legislation I authored calling for a concerted strategy by the State and Defense Departments to counter this threat. The House passed it unanimously in early December of this year, and it was signed into law by the President on December 14th. The need for this legislation was recently underscored when Boko Haram bombers attacked a busy market in Madagali, Nigeria, killing at least 50 and critically wounding many more. Boko Haram has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and continues to commit terrible acts of brutal violence against innocent civilians. My bipartisan legislation signals a renewed congressional commitment to pursuing Boko Haram and bolstering U.S. efforts throughout the region. The already dire situation there will continue to worsen, and this terrorist group will pose a threat not only to African countries but also to the United States and our allies. The passage of my legislation in the House was aided by the strong backing of the Congressional Black Caucus. In a letter of support, the CBC notes that Boko Haram has killed more than 20,000 people since 2009. Additionally, as a result of the terrorist insurgency in northeastern Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, 2.6 million people have become refugees and millions more face starvation. Untold numbers have been tortured, sexually abused, and murdered, creating a humanitarian crisis that may take generations to heal. Indeed, the very name of the terrorist group proclaims its goal of destroying hope for a better future in the region. By definition, Boko Haram means \u201cWestern education is forbidden.\u201d We must never forget that the girls of Nigeria were targeted simply because they chose to pursue an education. That mass kidnapping was not an isolated incident: Boko Haram is particularly focused on terrorizing women, girls, and religious minorities, just as the Taliban sought to silence Malala Yousafzai, the teenage girl who was shot by a gunman after she took a school exam in Pakistan. My legislation strengthens our efforts against Boko Haram, including the development of a long-term diplomatic and military strategy to counter the threat. This strategy includes bolstering the government of Nigeria\u2019s ability to protect schoolchildren and to combat gender-based violence and inequality. Combatting oppression against women and girls and increasing their opportunities around the world has been a long-standing priority of mine. This legislation sends a clear signal to the international community that these girls are not forgotten and that America will not sit idly by and allow these atrocities committed by Boko Haram or any other terrorist group to continue."},

The Fair Return for Employees on Their Initial Retirement Earned (RETIRE) Act will help federal firefighters, law enforcement officers, Customs and Border Protection officials, and other federal employees with physically demanding jobs receive their full retirement benefits if they are injured on the job. Currently, federal employees who are injured in the line of service and return to work for the federal government lose the early retirement benefits they had earned before their injury. \u201cWe count on federal law enforcement officers, firefighters, and other public safety employees when tragedy strikes,\u201d   \u201cThese brave men and women make tremendous sacrifices to protect our communities, and their strenuous and often dangerous occupation puts them at heightened risk of injury.

If 6c employees, such as firefighters and law enforcement officers, are injured on the job and unable to return to work before they fulfill their mandatory 20-25 years of service, they lose all of the benefits they have paid into the early retirement system even if they return to work for the federal government as a non-6c designated employee. The Senators\u2019 bipartisan bill will help these injured employees by allowing them to continue to pay into their 6c retirement accounts even if they don't return to work in a 6c-designated occupation. Additionally, the Fair RETIRE Act will allow those public servants who were hurt while performing a 6c-designated occupation to retire after 20-25 years of federal service and be eligible for a lump sum payment of the benefits owed to them from their 6c retirement funds. The Fair RETIRE Act is supported by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), and the NFFE's Forest Service Council. \"Law enforcement officers and other federal public safety employees who suffer a disabling injury in the line of duty should not be penalized by the very retirement system that ought to be honoring their sacrifice and service,\"   Nathan Catura, National President of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. \"Thank you Senators Tester and Collins for your strong leadership on this important issue.

{"title": "Made in the USA: Providing Our Soldiers with Top-Quality, American-made Footwear", "date": ["Posted Mon, 01/09/2017 - 14:04"], "release": "The men and women of America\u2019s armed forces exemplify the very best of our nation\u2019s values \u2013 courage, devotion to duty, and a commitment to freedom. The men and women of New Balance exemplify the very best of our nation\u2019s manufacturing heritage \u2013 a strong work ethic and unsurpassed skills. A provision the Maine Delegation fought to include in the new 2017 National Defense Authorization Act ensures that those who step forward to serve our country have top-quality American-made athletic footwear during their training. On Dec. 14, I was delighted to join Senator Angus King and Representative Bruce Poliquin at the New Balance factory in Skowhegan to celebrate our success working together to incorporate our \u201cMade in America\u201d component of the crucial defense bill. The legislation passed the Senate and House by overwhelming margins and was signed into law. This is a significant victory for American jobs and manufacturers like New Balance, a 110-year-old company with three factories and some 900 workers here in Maine. Like their colleagues at New Balance factories in Massachusetts, the skilled Maine workers cherish their status as one of the only companies still making athletic shoes in the USA. Our provision, which survived strong opposition from special-interest groups, mandates that the Department of Defense treat athletic footwear issued to military recruits as subject to the Berry Amendment, as it does other uniform items. The Berry amendment, passed in 1941, requires the U.S. military to provide its personnel with American-made and sourced clothing and other essential military items. Despite this long-standing law, and despite the fact that it issues American-made items such as combat boots and service uniforms, the Department of Defense has not previously provided new recruits with athletic footwear that is compliant with the Berry Amendment, instead issuing them vouchers that could be used for foreign-made shoes. I have long sought to require the Department of Defense to comply with the law and allow domestic manufacturers like New Balance to compete for contracts to provide domestically produced athletic footwear to our servicemen and women. In 2013, I hand-delivered a letter I authored with Senator King to then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, urging him to treat athletic footwear like nearly every other clothing item and procure it from American manufacturers. More than two years ago, Senator King and I joined together to author legislation to ensure that the Pentagon provide American-made athletic footwear just as it does American-made combat boots and service shoes. In addition, at my request, senior Defense officials visited New Balance to see first-hand that America produces high-quality athletic shoes. In April of 2015, the Defense Department announced it would require recruits to use their vouchers for \u201cMade in the USA\u201d athletic shoes. More than a year later, however, the Defense Department had not purchased a single pair of American-made athletic shoes, despite significant investments by New Balance in equipment, design, and worker training to produce military-grade shoes. Such foot-dragging by the Pentagon was unacceptable. Building on the Buy American Act Senator King and I introduced in the Senate, and Representative Poliquin\u2019s Stepping up for American Workers and Troops Act, we were successful in adding our legislation as an amendment to the annual defense bill. I will relentlessly push the Pentagon to fully implement our \u201cBuy American\u201d provision. Jobs will undoubtedly be kept or created when American shoe companies expand their operations to participate in a substantial market. Since 2002, the military has spent about $180 million providing allowances for athletic shoes. Our servicemen and women, and our national security, stand to benefit as well. With World War II already raging across Europe and Asia in the spring of 1941 and America\u2019s entry looming, the Berry Amendment was passed to ensure that the military doesn\u2019t have to rely on foreign producers any more than necessary. The more the military buys products made in the United States, the more likely it is that our troops will continue to receive the supplies they need in wartime. Throughout my service in the Senate, I have advocated for policies and trade agreements that support the manufacturing industries that are such an integral part of Maine\u2019s history and bright future.

The letter from Senators Susan Collins and Angus King, and Representatives Chellie Pingree and Bruce Poliquin urges the VA to fill those vacancies with qualified staff as soon as possible to ensure that Maine veterans have access to the quality and timely care they deserve. Maine has one of the highest number of veterans per capita of any state in the country. There are five Vet Centers across the state that are administered by the VA \u2013 in\u00a0Bangor, Caribou, Lewiston, Portland, and Sanford-Springvale.\u00a0\u00a0These Vet Centers\u00a0help veterans readjust to civilian life by providing free counseling, screening, and referral services, while removing the stigma of seeking mental health care. However, the\u00a0Caribou and Portland Vet Centers have had inadequate staff levels for months. While the Caribou Vet Center is authorized to have five employees, it has had multiple vacancies for some time, which has led to a lack of consistent counseling for veterans in Northern Maine. The Portland Vet Center currently has only four staff members despite being authorized for six, and lacks administrative staff. As a result, staff may have to cover both mental health needs while taking on additional administrative duties.

The Readjustment Counseling Service provides a variety of social and psychological service \u00a0to veterans, and due to the current staffing vacancies at Vet Centers in Caribou and Portland, veterans are not receiving the level and consistency of care they deserve. This has unfortunately been a persistent problem, and we urge the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to act quickly to fill vacancies with qualified staff to ensure our veterans can access the quality care they have earned. We also ask that you provide us with a hiring timeline for filling these vacancies.\u00a0 With one of the highest number per capita of veterans in the country, Maine has five Vet Centers. Of the five Vet Centers in Maine, the two in Caribou and Portland have had inadequate staff levels for months:\u00a0 We understand that the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s Regional Counseling Service is in the process of overhauling the human resources processes related to Vet Centers, and we support this effort to optimize the hiring practices.

Our veterans selflessly served the United States and their communities, and as such, they deserve access to the highest level of care when they return home.

Continuing resolutions put our government on autopilot, funding outdated programs at rates that may not be appropriate and locking in the previous year\u2019s priorities. These measures also create uncertainty, delay the start of vital programs, and end up costing the government more money. \u201cAs a Subcommittee chairman and senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I find these continuing resolutions particularly frustrating. This year, the Appropriations Committee successfully followed the regular order and completed work on all 12 funding bills, passing many of them with unanimous support. Several of these individual funding bills were brought before the full Senate for members to examine, debate, and vote on in a transparent manner. In fact, under my leadership, the full Senate passed in May an appropriations bill I authored with Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) with overwhelming bipartisan support, 89-8. The legislation incorporated recommendations from more than 75 Senators and would have made vital investments in our nation\u2019s infrastructure, helped meet the housing needs of the most vulnerable among us, and provided funding for economic development projects that create jobs in our communities. \u201cDespite my deep frustrations with this measure, there are some important new provisions in the continuing resolution. For example, there is funding for state grants that will supplement opioid abuse and treatment programs. Those funds are particularly important to Maine, which is now losing approximately one person per day to this horrible epidemic. The continuing resolution also includes $872 million to fund the recently passed 21st Century Cures bill, which included five provisions I authored. In addition, there is $170 million to address the drinking water crisis in cities such as Flint, Michigan, and funding for lead exposure programs, which is important for schools and homes in states like Maine that have a very old housing stock. The bill also incorporates the Security Assistance Appropriations Act, which provides an additional $10.1 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funding to pay for costs related to counterterrorism operations. \u201cFinally, this bill is important for what it does not include. It does not include a House proposed cut in the funding for the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) destroyers built by Bath Iron Works. \u201cMoving forward, Congress must abandon these stop-gap measures and return to funding the government through regular order.\u201d"},

{"title": "Maine Congressional Delegation Urges VA to Fill Vacancies at Maine Vet Centers", "date": ["Posted Tue, 12/13/2016 - 08:41"], "release": "Today, the Maine Congressional Delegation sent a letter to the Veterans Administration (VA) expressing concern about several long-unfilled vacancies at two Vet Centers in Maine. The letter from Senators Susan Collins and Angus King, and Representatives Chellie Pingree and Bruce Poliquin urges the VA to fill those vacancies with qualified staff as soon as possible to ensure that Maine veterans have access to the quality and timely care they deserve. Maine has one of the highest number of veterans per capita of any state in the country. There are five Vet Centers across the state that are administered by the VA \u2013 in\u00a0Bangor, Caribou, Lewiston, Portland, and Sanford-Springvale.\u00a0\u00a0These Vet Centers\u00a0help veterans readjust to civilian life by providing free counseling, screening, and referral services, while removing the stigma of seeking mental health care. However, the\u00a0Caribou and Portland Vet Centers have had inadequate staff levels for months. While the Caribou Vet Center is authorized to have five employees, it has had multiple vacancies for some time, which has led to a lack of consistent counseling for veterans in Northern Maine. The Portland Vet Center currently has only four staff members despite being authorized for six, and lacks administrative staff. As a result, staff may have to cover both mental health needs while taking on additional administrative duties. The delegation\u2019s letter, which was addressed to VA Undersecretary for Health David Shulkin, also asks the VA to provide a timeline for the hiring process to fill these vacancies in Maine. The letter is available\u00a0 \u00a0and the text is below: +++ Dear Honorable Dr. Shulkin, We are writing to express our concerns regarding several, long-unfilled vacancies at two Vet Centers in the State of Maine. The Readjustment Counseling Service provides a variety of social and psychological service \u00a0to veterans, and due to the current staffing vacancies at Vet Centers in Caribou and Portland, veterans are not receiving the level and consistency of care they deserve. This has unfortunately been a persistent problem, and we urge the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to act quickly to fill vacancies with qualified staff to ensure our veterans can access the quality care they have earned. We also ask that you provide us with a hiring timeline for filling these vacancies.\u00a0 With one of the highest number per capita of veterans in the country, Maine has five Vet Centers. Of the five Vet Centers in Maine, the two in Caribou and Portland have had inadequate staff levels for months:\u00a0 We understand that the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s Regional Counseling Service is in the process of overhauling the human resources processes related to Vet Centers, and we support this effort to optimize the hiring practices. Nevertheless, the vacancies in Caribou and Portland have been open for far too long and need to be filled as soon as possible. Our veterans selflessly served the United States and their communities, and as such, they deserve access to the highest level of care when they return home. We urge you to fill these positions as soon as possible so that no veteran is denied the care they deserve. \u00a0If you have any questions about this request, please contact us directly or have your staff contact William Ellis (King) at 202-224-5344 or Mike Wakefield (Collins) at 202-224-3913. Thank you for your prompt attention to this issue. Sincerely,"},

Ms. Martin was invited to testify before the Senate Aging Committee by its Chairman, U.S. Senator Susan Collins, during a hearing focused on the financial abuse of older Americans by guardians and others in power. \u201cFinancial abuse of seniors by those they trust is far too common. Today\u2019s hearing helps us understand the extent to which our seniors remain at risk of financial exploitation by guardians, and what is being done to protect them from this reprehensible crime,\u201d   \u201cSeniors in need of assistance to manage their financial affairs should not have their trust betrayed, leaving them destitute in some cases. Legal organizations like Ms. Martin\u2019s, and others around the nation, are making a real difference to better protect seniors but much more remains to be done.\u201d In addition to robbing seniors of their hard-earned savings, financial abuse of older adults often puts seniors\u2019 health and safety at risk. The scope of this form of exploitation is broad and can be perpetrated by a range of fiduciaries, such as a court-appointed guardian, a family member with power of attorney privileges, or a senior\u2019s personal attorney. In addition, senior financial abuse can be committed by \u201cfriends\u201d or family members who are handling the victim\u2019s affairs informally. During the hearing, Senator Collins questioned Ms. Martin about the Senior$afe Act,   with Senator McCaskill that would help protect seniors by encouraging banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions to train their employees to spot financial abuse of older Americans and report it to the proper authorities. The legislation is based on Maine\u2019s innovative Senior$afe program.  \u201cHas [Senior$afe] worked well [in Maine], in your judgment, and is this something we should implement nationwide?\u201d \u201c[Senior$afe] has been an extraordinary success, and we were thrilled to see your leadership in taking the concept to the nation,\u201d   \u201cHundreds of financial institution managers and employees have been trained, and we are really seeing that increase the number of seniors that are getting help before it\u2019s too late.\u201d The Committee also released a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report requested by Chairman Collins and Ranking Member McCaskill on guardianship abuse.

Since then, commercial seed has been developed, planted, and harvested, with the first crop being made widely available to consumers this weekend. \u201cMaine\u2019s potato industry is essential to our economy and is responsible for the creation or support of approximately 5,000 jobs, with an annual economic impact of more than $540 million. As a native of Aroostook County, I was fortunate to have grown up amid the values of hard work, determination, innovation, and common sense that mark the potato industry and those who work in it,\u201d   \u201cToday\u2019s release of the Caribou Russet is the result of the productive partnership between the Maine Potato Board and the University of Maine. I commend Dr. Greg Porter, his UMaine research team, and the Board on their successful collaboration.\u201d The Caribou Russet, which was developed by the University of Maine, is a dual-purpose, russet-skinned variety potato with high yields, mid-season maturity, and moderate common scab resistance. In addition to fresh-market consumption, the new variety is expected to be useful for processing markets. Following the Maine Harvest Festival, the Caribou Russet will be available in select stores in Maine. As the supply is increased, the potato will be made available in more locations. \u201cIt\u2019s always exciting when we can introduce something new to the market,\u201d   \u201cThis is particularly exciting because it is a really unique russet. We\u2019re calling it the potato lover\u2019s potato because it has a nice, rich flavor and is perfect for baking, mashing, or grilling. We think that people will really enjoy what they taste, and we\u2019re looking forward to putting them in consumers\u2019 hands this weekend in Bangor\u2026Sen. Collins is very supportive of our industry, and shares in our excitement about the Caribou Russet.\u201d The 6th annual Maine Harvest Festival is presented by the Maine Potato Board. More than 150 venders and approximately 6,000 people are expected to attend the event over the course of the weekend. For more information on the Maine Potato Board, visit  ."},

{"title": "Poised for Progress: Learning About Promising Advances in Alzheimer's Research", "date": ["Posted Tue, 11/22/2016 - 09:53"], "release": "Sen. Susan M. Collins November 22, 2016 Biomedical research is changing lives and changing the world. During my time in the Senate, I have made it a priority to visit labs, equipment manufacturers, and educational institutions\u2014here in Maine and across the country\u2014that are on the cutting-edge of science and technological innovation. Recently, a Maine resident with ties to the University of Pennsylvania invited me to tour a research lab there and to speak with scientists who are conducting exciting studies of the human brain that may one day lead to a cure or effective treatments for devastating diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s. During my visit, I peered inside a brain ravaged by Alzheimer\u2019s disease and a brain that was not. The difference was striking. The disease-riddled brain had shriveled to half the original size, and the ventricle had enlarged to what looked like a gaping hole in the brain. Many families are familiar with the tragic symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s: memory loss that disrupts life, confusion with time and place, trouble understanding, difficulty completing tasks, social withdrawal, changes in mood and personality, and inability to recognize loved ones. But seeing the signs in the brain demonstrated clearly the destructive nature of the disease and the promise of the research underway. I have served as Co-Chair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer\u2019s since I founded it in the Senate in 2004. Earlier this year, I helped secure nearly $1.4 billion in federal funding for Alzheimer\u2019s research that is included in the bill that would fund the National Institutes of Health. That\u2019s a $400 million increase over last year and would build on the $350 million increase that I successfully advocated for in 2015. If enacted, this funding will represent significant progress toward the goal of providing $2 billion per year for Alzheimer\u2019s research, the amount experts say is needed to find a means of prevention or effective treatments by the year 2025. At the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at the University of Pennsylvania, and in research centers like The Jackson Laboratory here in Maine and others, NIH funding is making a difference. The Penn researchers with whom I met described promising trials that are underway to solve the mystery of Alzheimer\u2019s. The research is exciting; clinical trials are underway, and new developments are happening every day. Scientists are beginning to conduct randomized controlled trials on lifestyle factors including the impact of diet and exercise on cognitive health. The researchers at Penn told me that changes to our lifestyles could potentially reduce or delay the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease in people who do not have the gene associated with early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s. I also had the opportunity to learn more about cutting-edge biomedical research being conducted at Harvard University, where researchers are examining the role of a gene regulator that helps protect aging neurons from stress, like the toxic effects of abnormal proteins, and whether this protective regulator can be stimulated to prevent or delay Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias. Currently, most of the Alzheimer\u2019s drug candidates under development seek to reduce Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathologies. If the research at Harvard proves successful, however, it might open up entirely new avenues in Alzheimer\u2019s research and development related to this protective mechanism in the aging brain. The stakes are high. Alzheimer\u2019s is ravaging brains and lives at an alarming rate \u2013 every 66 seconds, someone in the United States develops the disease. Approximately 5.4 million Americans are living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease today, including 37,000 in Maine, and that number is soaring as our overall population grows older and lives longer. In addition to the devastating human cost, this escalation has dire implications for the federal budget. The United States currently spends more than $236 billion per year on Alzheimer\u2019s treatment and care, including $160 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid, making it our nation\u2019s costliest disease. November is National Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and Awareness Month. With historic increases in funding, and continued top-rate research, we are poised to finally make progress. But this is no time to take our foot off the accelerator. We must continue at full speed to advance this shared goal for families who have been touched by Alzheimer\u2019s and for those who are at risk. One discovery at a time, we will find ways to re-shape aging, preserve brain health and well-being, and find that elusive cure."},

{"title": "Automated and Self-Driving Vehicles: The Life-Saving Technology that could Revolutionize Our Transportation System", "date": ["Posted Tue, 11/29/2016 - 09:28"], "release": "Sen. Susan M. Collins Nov. 28, 2016 Cars that drive themselves and avoid accidents. Seniors and disabled individuals able to retain or gain their ability to get around town in autonomous vehicles. At first, it sounds like science fiction or an advance far off in the future. But this technology is being tested and perfected right now, and it could save thousands of lives. As Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, I recently held a hearing to examine the role of government in enhancing roadway safety through the careful deployment of automated and self-driving vehicles, which could revolutionize our transportation system. Following the release by the U.S. Department of Transportation in late September of a new federal policy to guide the development and deployment of this new generation of motor vehicles, our hearing, with a panel of expert witnesses, focused on how automakers could bring the safety and mobility benefits of autonomous vehicles into the marketplace without unnecessary government regulations stifling innovation. More than 35,000 lives were lost in crashes on U.S. roadways in 2015, and preliminary estimates indicate that there was a 10 percent increase in roadway fatalities in the first half of 2016. More than 90 percent of roadway crashes are the result of human factors, or simply put, driver error, such as distracted driving, impaired driving, and speeding. The testing and safe deployment of automated vehicle technologies have the potential to reduce substantially this number of preventable driver-related crashes and fatalities. If the technology were perfected, automated vehicles could eliminate many of the crashes on our nation\u2019s roadways and save thousands of lives every year. In addition, self-driving vehicles can provide mobility options to our seniors and disabled populations, particularly those living in rural communities like here in Maine, where too many of our older drivers currently do not have an easy way to get to the doctor or to the grocery store. Public transportation is nonexistent in much of Maine, and taxi service is very limited in rural areas. Seniors who can no longer drive often have very few options. A self-driving car, or even one with limited automated features, could help seniors feel more comfortable driving at night and could help those who currently must rely on others to get around to maintain their independence. While fully self-driving autonomous vehicles are still years away from being available to the general public, many new vehicles already have driver-assist features such as automatic emergency breaking, rearview cameras, and lane-keep assist systems. These technologies are already saving lives and reducing injuries on our roadways. Further, one of our witnesses stated that, by reducing congestion and aggressive driving, self-driving vehicles could save time and fuel while improving air quality. Automated vehicle technology is advancing faster than government agencies can act, and impeding innovation may prevent us from saving lives. The Department of Transportation\u2019s new policy begins to address that issue with a voluntary 15-point \u201csafety assessment\u201d that incentivizes automakers to certify they have addressed all relevant issues ranging from cybersecurity, to human-machine interface, to ethical considerations. From Ford and Tesla to Google and Uber, automated and self-driving vehicle technology is advancing rapidly. Given the public\u2019s keen interest in these vehicles, the federal, state, and local governments must take a balanced approach in allowing for their research, development, and deployment. It is particularly important that federal agencies work with state and local governments, as well as manufacturers and technology companies, to ensure that this transportation revolution advances both safety and the spirit of innovation that could literally save lives."},

CAPs were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal on May 30, 2014, to recognize their military service and exemplary record. The text of Senators Collins and Mikulski\u2019s resolution follows: Title: Recognizing the vital role the Civil Air Patrol has played, and continues to play, in supporting the homeland security and national defense of the United States. Whereas, on December 1, 1941, a new civilian defense organization known as the Civil Air Patrol was founded, which was to rely on volunteer civilian aviators who would fly in support of the homeland security of the United States; Whereas with the attack on Pearl Harbor 6 days later and the entry of the United States into World War II, the Civil Air Patrol would find itself serving the United States in ways that were not imagined at the time of the conception of the Civil Air Patrol; Whereas the Civil Air Patrol initially engaged in coastal patrol operations that were considered critical to the United States war effort, piloting aircraft that in total flew 24,000,000 miles over 18 months, reporting 173 possible enemy submarines, and dropping 82 bombs or depth charges; Whereas Civil Air Patrol civilian volunteers flew privately owned light aircraft armed with military bombs at the expense of the volunteers, often at low altitude, in bad weather, and up to 60 miles from shore; Whereas Civil Air Patrol civilian volunteers undertook other vital World War II missions nationwide, which included border patrols, search and rescue operations, courier and cargo services, and air defense and pilot training; Whereas, unlike many organizations at the time, the Civil Air Patrol welcomed women into its ranks to fly for the Civil Air Patrol, with approximately one half of the women later joining the Women\u2019s Airforce Service Pilots (commonly known as \u201cWASP\u201d) after having first flown with the Civil Air Patrol; Whereas the Civil Air Patrol was open to all pilots interested in flying for the Civil Air Patrol, which allowed African-Americans an opportunity to serve and fly for the United States well before the adoption of the integrated Armed Forces; Whereas, in 2016, the Civil Air Patrol continues its critical mission in service to the United States, now as a vital partner for the Air Force, serving as the auxiliary force, and, since 2015, as an official component of the total force; Whereas the Civil Air Patrol remains one of the premier inland search and rescue organizations of the United States, and was credited with saving the lives of 69 individuals through search and rescue operations in 2015; Whereas the Civil Air Patrol continues to fulfill many other vital missions, including helping train interceptor pilots and unmanned aerial vehicle operators under realistic conditions, aerial observation missions, counterdrug operations, disaster relief support, live organ transport, aerospace education, cadet programs, and Reserve Officer Training Corps orientation flights; Whereas the continued work of the all-volunteer force of the Civil Air Patrol offers vital support to homeland security and defense missions; and Whereas the weekly youth and aerospace education programs of the Civil Air Patrol continue to introduce young students to the field of aviation and instill within the students the values of national service and personal responsibility: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate\u2014 (1) applauds the Civil Air Patrol for 75 years of continuous service in times of peace and war; (2) recognizes the critical emergency services, training support, and mission capabilities that the Civil Air Patrol offers State and national homeland security agencies as well as the United States Armed Forces; and (3) commends the more than 23,500 youth and 32,500 adult volunteers of the Civil Air Patrol, who hail from a range of professions and across the United States, and dedicate their time to the service of their communities and the United States."},

According to the GAO, guardianship abuse is widespread, but it remains difficult to determine the extent of elder abuse by guardians nationally due to limited data. GAO noted that some progress is being made to collect data on guardianships and improve the guardianship process. In 2013, the Department of Health and Human Services began developing the National Adult Mistreatment Reporting System (NAMRS) to provide consistent and accurate national data on senior abuse. HHS has completed the pilot project and expects to roll out the system next year. In addition, GAO identified a number of measures that can be taken to protect seniors from guardianship abuse, including for courts to ensure that a guardianship is truly needed before appointing one and periodically reexamine whether a guardianship is still needed. Courts should also make sure that guardians are screened for criminal backgrounds and are properly educated on their role and responsibilities.

The issue affects 24 facilities in 15 states, including the proposed Portland community-based outpatient clinic (CBOC) lease for which   earlier this year. The letter, which was addressed to Senate leadership as well as to the leadership of the Senate Appropriations and VA Committees, was signed by 18 Senators, including Senator Angus King (I-ME). All 24 of these leases have already been fully funded by Congress, but their authorization has been delayed due to a budgetary technicality. Under current rules, the Congressional Budget Office scores these leases as having large, up-front direct costs even though spending would not increase and the leases are subject to annual appropriations. As a result of this scoring issue, Congress has had difficulty authorizing major medical leases for the past three years. The proposed CBOC in Portland would consolidate the existing Saco and Portland CBOCs and enhance VA outpatient services. The lease would increase veterans\u2019 access to a core set of services and additional specialty care in a right-sized, state-of-the-art, energy efficient health care facility in the Portland area. The planned full deployment of tele-medicine technologies in the new clinic would further improve veterans\u2019 access to care in rural locations throughout Maine. Although Senator Collins secured funding for the proposed Portland CBOC earlier this year, it cannot move forward without authorization. \u201cVeterans deserve convenient access to high-quality health care services they have earned through their service,\u201d   \u201cCBOCs provide an essential service to our veterans by allowing them to receive outpatient care without the stress and difficulty of traveling to larger VA medical centers, which may be located far away from veterans\u2019 homes. I will continue to urge my colleagues to support the authorization of these leases so that vital facilities like the proposed Portland CBOC can begin serving our veterans.\u201d \u201cThe longer these VA medical facility leases sit unauthorized, the longer our veterans might be waiting for the quality health care services they earned,\u201d   \u201cThat, quite simply, is unacceptable.

{"title": "\"Trust Betrayed: Financial Abuse of Older Americans by Guardians and Others in Power\"", "date": ["Posted Mon, 12/05/2016 - 08:34"], "release": "Earlier this year, an attorney in Belfast was sentenced to 30 months in prison for bilking two elderly female clients out of nearly a half a million dollars over the course of several years. The lawyer\u2019s brazen theft was uncovered when a teller at a local bank noticed that he was writing large checks to himself on his clients\u2019 accounts. When confronted by authorities, he offered excuses that the prosecutor later described as \u201cbreathtaking.\u201d For example, according to press reports, he put one of his clients into a nursing home to recover from a temporary medical condition, and then kept her there for four years until the theft of her funds came to light. Meanwhile, he submitted bills for \u201cservices,\u201d sometimes totaling $20,000 a month, including charging her $250 per hour for six to seven hours to check on her house, even though his office was just a one-minute drive down the road. Another tragic case of theft and abuse was featured in a Maine Sunday Telegram article last month. The article detailed the story of an elderly woman from Los Angeles, California, who went missing in 2008. In 2012, authorities found her, alive but in poor health, abandoned in a tiny cabin in Maine by three people who had \u201cbefriended\u201d her years earlier. After gaining the woman\u2019s trust, and control of her finances, these criminals sold her house and stole her money, cheating her of an estimated $1 million in assets. Today, this 90-year-old woman is a ward of the state and lives in a nursing home in rural Maine \u2013 thousands of miles away from the life she used to know. These Maine cases represent shocking breaches of trust and shed light on a national epidemic of financial abuse of seniors by those they trust. Sometimes, that abuse is perpetrated by \u201cfriends\u201d or family members who are handling the victim\u2019s affairs informally. Other times, the abuse is committed under color of a fiduciary relationship, such as a Power of Attorney in the Maine cases, or what\u2019s known as a conservatorship or guardianship. One would hope that this abuse would be unusual where guardians or conservators are involved since these fiduciaries are formally appointed and overseen by state courts. But experience has shown that this is not always the case. As the Chairman of the Aging Committee, I have been long been concerned by guardianship abuse that robs seniors of their hard-earned savings and often puts their health and safety at risk. I recently chaired a hearing on this subject to examine the extent to which our seniors remain at risk of financial exploitation by guardians, and what is being done to protect them from this reprehensible crime. At my invitation, Jaye Martin, the Executive Director of Legal Services for the Elderly (LSE) in Maine, testified. According to Ms. Martin, LSE assisted 260 victims of elder abuse during the last 12 months. This is a 24 percent increase from the prior year. While this number includes physical and emotional abuse as well, roughly half of the cases handled by LSE involved financial exploitation of seniors. Even more alarming was Ms. Martin\u2019s testimony that in 75 percent of those cases, the financial exploitation was carried out by a family member. Unfortunately, these numbers only represent the tip of the iceberg, since so many abuse cases go unreported. Oftentimes, victims are too ashamed or afraid to alert authorities about financial exploitation, particularly when it involves a family member. During the hearing, the Committee heard testimony about some of the promising initiatives that are being undertaken at the state level to combat this form of financial exploitation. One such example is Minnesota\u2019s Conservator Account Auditing Program, which monitors guardians of seniors by requiring them to file regular reports. The state uses an automated software-based system that scans these conservator reports for 30 \"red flags\" that may indicate abuse or mismanagement of the estate. Minnesota is making this innovative software reporting and analysis system available to other states free of charge. Legal organizations like Ms. Martin\u2019s, and others around the nation, are also a significant part of the solution to this burgeoning problem and are making a real difference. I asked Ms. Martin whether additional tools would be beneficial to her efforts on the frontlines to better protect seniors. In response, she noted that Maine\u2019s innovative Senior$afe program has been an \u201cextraordinary success,\u201d and she was thrilled that I introduced a bill earlier this Congress that would take this concept to the nation. My Senior$afe Act would help protect seniors by encouraging banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions to train their employees to spot financial abuse of older Americans and report it to the proper authorities. Seniors in need of assistance to manage their financial affairs should not have their trust betrayed, leaving them destitute in some cases. While progress is being made, and most guardians are ethical, much more needs to be done to oversee guardians and uncover potential abuse in time to stop it. It is essential that the federal and state governments work together to better ensure that guardians are protecting vulnerable seniors, not stealing from them."},

Specifically, HHS will remove the pain management questions from the patient satisfaction survey that is tied to hospitals\u2019 reimbursement rate. These questions may inadvertently encourage treatment with opioid pain relievers, contributing to the vast supply of prescription opioids currently in circulation in our country. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for painkillers in 2012, enough for every American adult to have a bottle of pills.\u00a0 \u201cOur nation\u2019s opioid and heroin epidemic has devastated countless families and communities across the country. Physicians now face the complicated task of treating pain in an environment where abuse of prescription painkillers is one of the foremost public health challenges facing our nation. This epidemic requires us to examine our existing policies to ensure that they are not inadvertently contributing to our vast oversupply of opioids, which harms families and communities across America,\u201d   \u201cFor this reason, I led a bipartisan coalition of 26 Senators in urging HHS to examine the current patient satisfaction surveys. I am so pleased that HHS has taken action to eliminate this possible contributing factor to this burgeoning crisis.\u201d Prior to this final rule, a portion of Medicare funding was tied to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) assessment of the quality of care provided at hospitals across our country, which was based in part on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey that discharged patients complete regarding their experience of care. This survey asked discharged patients to respond to questions including, \u201cDuring this hospital stay, how often was your pain well-controlled?\u201d and \u201cDuring this hospital stay, how often did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you with your pain?\u201d CMS is developing alternative questions for assessing the management of a patient\u2019s pain through focus group evaluation, field testing, and stakeholder input.

Senators Collins and Shaheen have consistently fought to increase funding for diabetes research and to promote better health care for people with diabetes. Insulin-dependent Medicare beneficiaries rely on therapies such as continuous glucose monitors, which can provide real-time readings and data about blood glucose levels, as well as patch pumps, which provide continuous insulin delivery from a patch, to help manage their disease. While many of these treatments are covered by private insurance, Medicare does not cover these devices.

{"title": "Welcoming Maine's Honor Flight: A Tribute to the Sacrifice of our Veterans", "date": ["Posted Mon, 11/07/2016 - 10:14"], "release": "Sen. Susan M. Collins It is the American character to answer the call of duty. It also is the American character to be grateful to those who answer that call. On Veterans Day, we express that gratitude with school assemblies, parades, and ceremonies. Every day of the year, citizens here in Maine and across America join together in countless ways to support and thank those who serve. One has only to look at the Troop Greeters, who have greeted more than a million troops at the Bangor Airport, to know how much the people of Maine value our service members. They treat our veterans with generosity and a spirit of caring, welcoming them back to our country on planes that arrive at all hours of the day and night. A truly remarkable demonstration of this spirit is Honor Flight, a nationwide non-profit organization that transports veterans free of charge to Washington, D.C., so that they can visit and reflect at the memorials that commemorate their service. Since its founding in 2004, more than 180,000 veterans from 42 states have come to our nation\u2019s capital through the generosity and compassion of Honor Flight and its many supporters \u2013 that includes nearly 21,000 last year alone. This June, I had the great pleasure to welcome 26 Maine veterans, who had come to Washington through an Honor Flight, at the World War II Memorial. My father is a World War II veteran who visited the Memorial when it was dedicated, and it was so inspiring to join those Maine heroes at the Memorial honoring their service. Many of the visitors at the World War II Memorial that morning thanked the Maine veterans for their service. In a moving tribute, as the veterans made their way to the Memorial, members of the public spontaneously lined up on both sides of the walkway and gave them a round of applause. At another stop during their weekend tour, the Maine veterans visited Fort McHenry in Baltimore, where, during the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key saw the American Flag still flying the morning after a battle and was inspired to write \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner.\u201d At the fort, the Maine veterans were joined by young students from California to unfurl an enormous 30-by-42-foot flag, identical to the one that withstood the battle. It is so encouraging to know that our young people respect and honor our veterans. As I travel throughout our great state, I see again and again an important quality among our veterans \u2013 they continue to serve long after their days in uniform come to an end. In civic affairs, community projects, and charities, our veterans step forward, giving back when they already have given so much. That quality of continuing to serve led to the forming of the Honor Flights. In 2004, when the World War II Memorial was dedicated, Earl Morse was a retired Air Force Flight Surgeon working at a VA center in Ohio. After learning that many of his patients dearly wanted to visit the Memorial but could not, due to the cost or health issues, he took action. Joined by five other volunteer private pilots, he led a squadron of six small planes that flew 12 Ohio veterans to Washington in May of 2005. As demand grew, so did volunteerism and financial support, and Earl\u2019s project soon was able to use commercial flights. By the end of 2005, 137 Ohio veterans had been transported to Washington, and Jeff Miller, a son of a veteran from North Carolina, worked with Earl to make the Honor Flight Network a national endeavor. From air fare, ground transport, meals, and lodging to medical staff and wheelchairs, everything is provided at no cost to the veterans. It is noteworthy that in 2015, the first all-female Honor Flight was held, with 140 women veterans visiting Washington. And the people of Maine should be proud to know that Earl Morse relocated to our state four years ago and now serves our veterans at the VA clinic in Bangor. While Mainers join all Americans in honoring our veterans every day, we also take time to pay tribute to them on Veterans Day, one of the most sacred days on our nation\u2019s calendar. The origin of Veterans Day is well known: it commemorates the moment when the guns of the First World War fell silent on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in the year 1918. It marks not conquest, but peace earned through valor and sacrifice. It is estimated that some 48 million Americans have served in uniform since the founding of our nation. Today, more than 22 million veterans live among us, more than 127,000 right here in Maine. To put that in perspective, Maine has more veterans per capita than all but two of the other states in the country. We are proud of our state\u2019s contributions to protecting our nation. Those numbers are impressive not only because of their sheer size, but also because they describe the history of a people united by the highest ideals of humanity. Those numbers are not cold statistics. Each one tells a story of courage, sacrifice, and devotion to duty. Those virtues echo throughout American history, so it is appropriate that Veterans Day now honors all who have defended our nation. Whether they serve in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, or the Merchant Marines, whether they serve in the active duty forces, the National Guard, or the Reserves, patriotic men and women pay the price of our freedom in times of conflict, and they are our shield in times of peace. The sacrifices made by veterans, those who serve today, and their families are great, and we owe them so much. As a Senator, I am committed to ensuring that these patriots receive the health care, rehabilitation services, education, and employment opportunities they have earned. As an American, I share the gratitude and respect that is exemplified in such wonderful programs that honor veterans\u2019 service and sacrifice like the Honor Flights."},

Given that 35,092 people died on U.S. roadways in 2015 and that 94 percent of crashes can be tied to a human choice or error, automated vehicles have the potential to substantially reduce driver-related crashes and fatalities, saving thousands of lives every year, by correcting human mistakes or using technology that takes over the full driving responsibility.

Kennedy Forum", "date": ["Posted Thu, 10/13/2016 - 19:55"], "release": "*Click   to watch the Kennedy Forum* \u00a0\u2014 At the invitation of Harvard University President Drew Gilpin Faust, U.S. Senator Susan Collins participated in the Harvard University Institute of Politics\u2019 John F. Kennedy Forum this evening. During the forum, Senator Collins engaged in a conversational one-on-one interview with the moderator, Dr. Douglas Elmendorf, Dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and took questions from the student audience. The wide-ranging discussion touched on a number of issues, including increasing partisanship in Congress and the need to restore civility and collaboration. \u201c[Senator Collins] improves the lives of her constituents and her fellow American citizens by working with colleagues of diverse political persuasions. It\u2019s a commitment that has sparked praise throughout her career,\u201d   \u201cPlease join me in welcoming to Harvard a public servant who embodies in word and deed the aspiration for government infused with civility, open to knowledge, and guided by wisdom.\u201d During the Forum, Senator Collins spoke about her views on the current political climate and how the parties have evolved over time. Senator Collins characterized partisanship as a pendulum, expressing optimism that the parties will move back to the political center. She offered a few ideas on ways to accelerate this process. \u201cOur country is becoming more and more polarized, and Congress reflects that polarization,\u201d   \u201cI would say to all of the young people who are here tonight that it\u2019s incumbent upon you to help us rebuild that sense of community that has been a traditional American value since the founding of our country.\u201d \u201cI believe that bringing people together makes a big difference,\u201d   \u201cThe women of the Senate get together about once a month for dinner. One reason the women of the Senate work together in a more collaborative way is because we have gotten to know each other through these dinners. I reject totally the concept that all the women Senators think alike or that we agree on the issues. But these dinners have allowed us to have a comfort zone to share experiences and collaborate on issues to find common ground.\u201d Senator Collins also suggested that Congress and the next president overcome the current partisan climate by identifying issues that have bipartisan support and are important to the American people. One example she cited is working to promote biomedical research. \u201cBiomedical research matters to every American family, for virtually every family has been affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease, our most costly disease, diabetes or cancer,\"   \"If our leaders would work together and commit to a multi-year increase for NIH funding, and propose ways to expedite new treatments and drugs through the FDA, that would make a real difference.\u201d As the founder and Co-Chairman of the Senate Diabetes Caucus and the Co-Chair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer\u2019s, Senator Collins has led bipartisan efforts in Congress to boost funding for the National Institutes of Health. Prior to tonight\u2019s event, Senator Collins toured Harvard\u2019s Sherman Fairchild Building and Engineering Science Lab to learn more about the cutting-edge biomedical research being conducted at the university. \u201cEspecially to those of us who have devoted our lives to higher education, Senator Collins is a stalwart champion of the long and productive partnership between the federal government and research universities,\u201d   \u201cShe believes in the power of science and the promise of human ingenuity, and she supports efforts to advance humanity\u2019s understanding of diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and diabetes\u2026We are all so fortunate to have a person of such ability and insight advocating for research in our nation\u2019s capital.\u201d The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics is Harvard's premier arena for political speech, discussion and debate. The forum regularly hosts heads of state, leaders in politics, government, business, labor and the media. A living memorial to President John F. Kennedy, the Institute's mission is to unite and engage students, particularly undergraduates, with academics, politicians, activists, and policy makers on a non-partisan basis to inspire them to consider careers in politics. ###"},

Last year alone, New Beginnings made nearly 2,000 contacts via street outreach and served more than 500 young people in their drop-in center. Moreover, using their case management services, the organization was able to place 86 percent of homeless youth into permanent housing. We are pleased that they are receiving this support to provide necessary services to some of Maine\u2019s most vulnerable young people.\u201d \u201cFor nearly 4 decades, New Beginnings has met homeless youths\u2019 most basic needs, connected at-risk teens to resources, and kept kids safe and off the streets,\u201d   \u201cBeing awarded this competitive grant means that hundreds of youth in Androscoggin, Kennebec, and Franklin counties can continue to get the critical emergency supplies, counseling, and housing resources they need to become thriving and stable adults.\u201d Since opening its doors more than 35 years ago, New Beginnings has helped homeless youth gain the sense of safety and security of having a place to call home and provided them with other resources to succeed, from assistance with college applications to developing such life skills as living on a budget and learning to cook. In June 2015, Senator Collins, a long-time supporter of homeless youth programs, was joined by U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Juli\u00e1n Castro, in touring the New Beginnings\u2019 Ann Geiger Center in Lewiston to see firsthand how organizations in Maine are working to end runaway and youth homelessness. In addition, in April 2015, Senator Collins chaired an Appropriations Subcommittee hearing to examine HUD\u2019s efforts to prevent and end youth homelessness.

{"title": "A New, Two Generation Approach to Fighting Poverty", "date": ["Posted Mon, 10/17/2016 - 09:55"], "release": "The photograph on the front page of the Sept. 25th Maine Sunday Telegram was heart wrenching \u2013 a darling 5-year-old girl named Arianna standing outside of her \u201chome\u201d \u2013 a makeshift tent in the woods near Portland. More than 50 years after President Lyndon Johnson declared a \u201cWar on Poverty,\u201d poverty remains a reality for millions of Americans who struggle to find the resources they need for the basic necessities of life. Since then, the federal government has spent trillions of taxpayer dollars on programs to combat poverty, yet the poverty rate has barely budged. In 1966, the poverty rate was 14.7 percent. Just this month, the U.S. Census Bureau announced that the poverty rate for 2015 was 13.5 percent. That is actually one percentage point higher than the year before the start of the 2008 Great Recession. Here in Maine, the poverty rate stands at 13.4 percent, just slightly below the national rate. In our state, and across the country, poverty spans rural towns and urban centers, race and ethnicity, men and women, old and young. It diminishes the chances of a bright future for far too many of our children. Despite our good intentions and despite the expenditure of trillions of dollars, we have made very limited progress in lifting families out of poverty. It is time to recognize that the federal government's current approach to poverty is disjointed and often ignores the very nature of a family. Federal programs have failed to achieve their promise of breaking the cycle of poverty that has trapped too many families. We should not accept such outcomes here in this land of opportunity. It is time for a new approach. I recently co-authored the bipartisan Two-Generation Economic Empowerment Act with my colleague, Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, which would address the gap between our good intentions as a society and the ineffective results. Our bill would equip both parents and their children with the tools that they need to succeed and become self-sufficient. It marks an important first step toward reevaluating our approach to poverty-reducing programs and promoting innovative, more effective uses of tax dollars. This multigenerational method has been successfully used by York County Community Action Corporation (YCCAC) to help entire families achieve a sustainable income, safe housing, and reliable employment. For example, a few years ago, YCCAC\u2019s outreach workers utilized this holistic approach to help a homeless family attain economic stability and, ultimately, purchase their own home. YCCAC was able to achieve this positive outcome by helping both parents secure employment, placing their children in Head Start and after-school programs, and providing educational resources and support. The legislation Senator Heinrich and I introduced would help promote other effective programs like YCCAC\u2019s. Our bill would authorize a five-state pilot program to provide additional flexibility for states and local governments to improve the administration of programs using two-generation models. The Two-Generation Act would also create an advisory group on multigenerational poverty to coordinate efforts across federal agencies aimed at supporting vulnerable families and to make recommendations to Congress on ways to improve coordination of anti-poverty programs. Finally, our bill would incentivize public-private partnerships to harness philanthropic and private-sector investments to implement proven social programs. The rest of Arianna\u2019s story shows that these partnerships and local initiatives can make all the difference. Thanks to the involvement of a Maine social worker and the Maine Homeless Veterans Alliance, who were committed to keeping the family together, her story, fortunately, has a happy ending. Arianna and her mother now live in an apartment in Auburn, and she has finally started kindergarten. The well-being of children like Arianna is closely linked to the well-being of their parents. I recently chaired a hearing that examined whether there is a better way to provide housing assistance to vulnerable families and individuals. Our expert witnesses pointed out that the single biggest predictor of a child\u2019s opportunities, and even that child\u2019s life expectancy, is the ZIP code of the community where the child grows up. Just as a child\u2019s ZIP code should not determine his or her future success, neither should the bureaucratic approach to poverty make it so difficult for families to get the help they need to escape intergenerational poverty. We don't want more cases where a 5-year-old girl is living in a make-shift tent outside of the largest city in our state. Fifty years from now, our century-old War on Poverty must no longer be a stalemate, but a victory. Acting today, we can help multiple generations be full participants in the American dream."},

Last month, she received the National Distinguished Advocacy Award from the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network for her dedication to increased cancer research funding and improved patient quality of life. \u201cAs National Breast Cancer Awareness Month comes to a close, we should celebrate life and the progress we are making in the fight against this disease,\u201d   \u201cWith determination and patience, we can bring hope to millions of women and their families.

{"title": "The Fight Against Breast Cancer: Celebrating Life and Assessing our Progress", "date": ["Posted Mon, 10/24/2016 - 15:54"], "release": "Breast Cancer has taken a toll on far too many Americans and their families. October is National Breast Cancer Awareness month, and this is the perfect time to be celebrating life and the progress we are making in the fight against this disease. Many people, either personally or through a loved one, have been affected by breast cancer. For many years, the color pink has been associated with breast cancer awareness. I recently had the opportunity to join researchers, medical professionals, advocates, and survivors at a \u201cThink Beyond Pink\u201d event in my hometown of Caribou, hosted by the Maine Breast Cancer Coalition. The title of this conference emphasized the important point that we have succeeded in raising awareness of the threat that breast cancer poses -- it is now time to redouble our efforts for prevention, treatment, and a cure. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American women, and about one in eight American women will develop invasive breast cancer at some point during her life. Nearly 250,000 women are expected to be diagnosed with the disease in 2016, and tragically, more than 40,000 women are likely not to survive. But there is good news in the fight against breast cancer. In 1980, the five-year survival rate for women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer was about 75 percent. Today, the five-year survival rate is 99 percent. This is no time to take our foot off the accelerator, however. We must continue to work to find new and more effective ways of preventing, detecting, and treating breast cancer. Regular screenings and early detection remain the most effective ways to combat breast cancer and improve a woman\u2019s chances for successful treatment and survival. It is critical that we take steps to make early detection more common. For this reason, I have long been a strong supporter of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. For more than 20 years, the program has provided important cancer screening services at low or no cost to more than three million low-income American women who otherwise might not have been able to afford these critically important tests. The Maine Breast and Cervical Health Program receives funding through this program, and provides screening and diagnostic services at more than 300 sites across the state. Nearly 19,000 women in Maine are estimated to be eligible for breast and cervical cancer screening services through this program, and approximately 4,200 are actively enrolled. If breast cancer screening is to save lives, it must be paired with medically necessary treatment. That is why I cosponsored the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, which became law in 2000. That legislation gave states the option to provide Medicaid coverage for women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through federally funded screening programs. I am pleased to report that all 50 states have elected to take advantage of this option, substantially improving access to care. Promising research is likely to produce breakthroughs in preventing, treating, and curing breast cancer. As a member of both the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee, one of my top priorities is increasing funding for biomedical research. There is simply no investment that promises greater returns for Americans than our investment in research. In his State of the Union address early this year, President Obama announced his support for a new national effort to find innovative treatments and, eventually, a cure for cancer. This builds upon Vice President Biden\u2019s call last year for a \u201cnew moonshot\u201d to defeat the disease following the tragic loss of his son, Beau, to brain cancer. The moonshot analogy is appropriate \u2013 just as our nation met the challenge of the space race a half-century ago, we can defeat cancer with a concerted effort. Congress has joined that effort. The funding bill we passed last December included $5 billion for the National Cancer Institute -- a $264 million boost -- and $120 million for the Department of Defense Peer-Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program. I was a strong advocate for the $2 billion increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health, the largest increase since 2003 and an investment that will pay dividends in our understanding of diseases like breast cancer. I am continuing to work for another $2 billion increase for NIH in fiscal year 2017. It is important to ensure our federal investment is wisely spent and used to advance the research we have already begun as well as to fund new concepts. To that end, I am an original cosponsor of the Accelerating the End of Breast Cancer Act, which would set a target for ending breast cancer by January 1, 2020. It would establish a commission, comprised of the best minds in biomedical research, breast cancer advocacy, and other related disciplines, to identify promising opportunities and ideas which are currently not being prioritized by the public and private sectors, and implement strategies to address them. While the prevention and cure of breast cancer are not yet within our grasp, I believe that we can win this fight with proper investments in biomedical research. I look forward to continuing to work with the research community and advocates, such as the Maine Breast Cancer Coalition, toward our shared goal of ending breast cancer by the year 2020. As National Breast Cancer Awareness Month comes to a close, we should celebrate life and the progress we are making in the fight against this disease. With determination and patience, we can bring hope to millions of women and their families.

{"title": "Honoring Adoption \u201cAngels\u201d Who Give Children Loving Homes", "date": ["Posted Fri, 09/30/2016 - 11:36"], "release": "Click   for a high resolution photo Every child needs and deserves a safe and loving home, a family to provide support, stability, and hugs. But for more than 100,000 children in America, tragic circumstances have robbed them of this basic right. Fortunately, there are \u201cangels\u201d among us, caring and generous people who open their homes and their hearts to these children through adoption. They are found throughout America, including Maine. On Sept. 20, Gail and John Neher, a remarkable couple from Aroostook County, were honored in Washington, D.C., for their commitment to children in need, along with \u201cangels\u201d from every state. Each year, members of Congress have the privilege of recognizing people from their home states who have truly made a difference in children\u2019s lives through adoption with \u201cAngels in Adoption\u201d awards. This year, as a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I nominated the Nehers for their truly inspiring efforts \u2013 the adoption of 14 children, all with heartbreaking starts in life and many with challenging special needs. The Nehers\u2019 story as adoptive parents began in 1988 when they were living in New Mexico. After their biological son left home for college, Gail and John adopted three siblings, two brothers and a sister, all suffering from significant mental health problems. In 2002, the couple moved to Cary Plantation in Aroostook County and started adopting children through Community Health and Counseling\u2019s therapeutic foster care program \u2013 11 Maine children in all. In addition, as foster parents, Gail and John have hosted more than 70 children in their home. The girls that they have adopted in Maine have special needs and require a higher level of care than other teens. All of the girls the Nehers have adopted during their high school years have graduated. The academic success of these girls is the accomplishment of which the Nehers are most proud. The Nehers believe it is important to keep families intact and have adopted two sets of Maine sisters. Gail and John encourage the girls with biological parents to have relationships with them. The Nehers focus on building positive memories with the girls. Gail drives with some or all of the girls across the country each summer to visit different historical and cultural sites. Both Gail and John are active volunteers at Community Health and Counseling in Houlton to help guide couples who are thinking about adopting, and Gail serves on the North American Council on Adoptable Children. I had the pleasure to meet with Gail and one of her daughters in 2008 to discuss the Adoption Equality Act I cosponsored. This legislation corrected a flaw in the Social Security Administration\u2019s adoption assistance program, which provides subsidies to families who are adopting children with special needs from foster care. The flaw in the program, however, required that a child\u2019s income eligibility be determined by his or her biological parents\u2019 income rather than that of the adoptive parents. Legislation signed into law later that year included a provision to phase out the use of income tests in determining eligibility, so that by 2018 any child with special needs may qualify for federal adoption assistance. We are making progress in encouraging adoption and supporting adoptive families. In 1997, my first year in the Senate, Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act that created the Adoption Incentives Program, which rewards states for their efforts to unite foster children with permanent, loving families. In 2003, I cosponsored the Adoption Promotion Act, which strengthened that program and added a new incentive to encourage the adoption of older children who need a stable and loving environment as they prepare for adulthood. Since the Adoption Incentives Program\u2019s inception, adoptions in the United States have increased by an estimated 64 percent. Since 2010, the number of children in foster care who are eligible for adoption has been reduced from 175,000 to slightly more than 100,000, including more than 400 here in Maine. But the need is still great. Now in its 17th year, the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute\u2019s Angels in Adoption Program has recognized more than 2,500 individuals, couples, and organizations for their extraordinary contributions on behalf of children in need of homes. They have ranged from the nationally known, such as Laura Bush, Bruce Willis, and the late Muhammad Ali, to our neighbors. They are united in the belief that there are no unwanted children, merely unfound families. It is efforts such as those being made by the \u201cAngels in Adoption\u201d program and the Adoption Promotion Act that are raising public awareness of the ways that committed individuals can help children through adoption and foster care. And it is the example set by angels like Gail and John Neher that will inspire others to open their homes and hearts through adoption."},

According to Boston College\u2019s Center for Retirement Research, there is an estimated $7.7 trillion gap between what Americans have saved for retirement and what they will actually need. As the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, Senator Collins has made increasing retirement security one of her top priorities. Improving the accessibility of retirement plans will have a significant effect on boosting retirement savings. Approximately 80 percent of employees contribute to a retirement plan if it is offered through their employer. By contrast, when employees lack access to a workplace plan, fewer than 10 percent contribute. While many small businesses would like to offer retirement plans to their employees, they are often stymied by the plans\u2019 cost and complexity. As a result, only 22 percent of workers at small firms have access to a workplace savings plan or pension, compared to 74 percent at firms with 500 or more employees. Senator Collins\u2019 provisions that were included by the Senate Finance Committee today will increase the affordability and accessibility of retirement plans by reducing and simplifying several onerous and unnecessary requirements. \u201cAmericans simply aren\u2019t saving enough to be able to afford a comfortable retirement. In fact, the Center for Retirement Research estimates that there is an estimated $7.7 trillion gap between what Americans have saved for retirement and what they will actually need,\u201d   \u201cWe know that when employers provide their employees with access to retirement plans, approximately 80 percent of them contribute. These changes would help promote retirement security by making it easier and less expensive for small businesses to establish retirement plans, increase their accessibility to employees, and help to ensure that those who worked hard for decades do not spend their retirement in poverty.\u201d The Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act includes language authored by Senator Collins in her  , which she introduced with Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) last year. Senator Collins\u2019 provisions would enable more small employers to offer retirement plans by: The Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act also includes measures from a bill  , which would direct the Department of Labor and the Treasury Department to allow employers and sole-proprietors participating in retirement plans administered the same way to file a single aggregated Form 5500, a required annual return that provides important compliance information. Currently, despite sharing a common administrative framework, each individual plan is required to file a separate Form 5500. Eliminating duplicative reporting by plan administrators will reduce costs for small businesses that maintain retirement plans."},

The Council, of which Stumpf is currently a member, is responsible for consulting with and offering direct insight to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on a broad range of economic, monetary, and financial issues. The letter, which was also signed by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), comes after revelations that Wells Fargo, under Stumpf\u2019s leadership, opened roughly two million checking and credit accounts without the knowledge of their customers. The complete text of the letter can be read below: +++ September 22, 2016 Roy A. Vallee Chairman of the Board, San Francisco Board of Directors Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 101 Market Street San Francisco, CA 94105 Dear Chairman Vallee: Given the importance of emphasizing both personal accountability at the senior management level and a healthier internal banking culture in the aftermath of the serious problems that provoked allegations of fraudulent activities at Wells Fargo, we write to urge you and the San Francisco Board of Directors not to reappoint John Stumpf to the Federal Advisory Council for a third one-year term in January 2017. As you are well aware, the twelve members of the Federal Advisory Council are chosen by the Reserve Banks to represent the twelve Federal Reserve Districts at the Federal Reserve Board. The Council normally meets four times a year, and each member typically serves three one-year terms. Section 12 of the Federal Reserve Act grants the Council power to consult directly with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on a broad range of economic, monetary, and financial issues. Members are asked for individual insights into regional trends as well as recommendations in regard to key decisions made by the central and Reserve Banks. It would be ironic if the Federal Reserve, a key federal banking regulator tasked in part with ensuring the fair and equitable treatment of consumers in financial transactions, continued to receive special insights and recommendations from senior management of a financial institution that just paid a record-breaking fine to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cabusive\u201d practices that placed consumers at financial risk. We do not wish to suggest that declining to reappoint Mr. Stumpf to a customary third term on the advisory council is the single corrective action to right all wrongs in this situation. Far from it. United States Senators both on and off the Banking Committee have publicly offered stronger tools for enhanced accountability, including recouping compensation from senior management. To overlook this option, however, would represent a failure on our part to review and identify all measures available to hold Mr. Stumpf personally accountable for the misconduct that took place on his watch. Perhaps even more distressing, it would leave a corporate voice that has admitted to betraying customer\u2019s trust on a powerful and reputable federal advisory body. This must and can be rectified. Please be advised that this situation may offer lessons for Congress should it seek to improve, through legislation, the membership of the Federal Advisory Council and similar advisory bodies at other federal banking regulators. In closing, we appreciate your consideration of our suggestion as you prepare to reappoint a member to the Federal Advisory Council in January 2017."},

She urged the Committee to advance the Personal Care Products Safety Act, which she introduced with Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me echo Senator Feinstein\u2019s thanks to you and the Ranking Member for holding this hearing and inviting us to testify on the important topic of the safety of personal care products.\u00a0 I also want to salute Senator Feinstein for her long-standing interest and leadership in this issue. \u201cAs she noted, Americans use a variety of personal care products daily, from shampoos and lotions to cosmetics and deodorants.\u00a0 Consumers should be able to know whether the products that they are applying to their own skin or the skin of their children and their hair are safe. \u201cWhile many companies have made a strong commitment to safety on a voluntary basis, under current law, the Food and Drug Administration has surprisingly very little authority to protect consumers. They even lack mandatory recall authority when a product is found to be harmful.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs has been mentioned numerous times, this summer, we were alarmed to learn the devastating account of a nine-year-old girl who lost all her hair after using a WEN hair product. But here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting to me: it turn out that the company had received more than 21,000 consumer reports of harmful effects, while the FDA had received a mere 127 reports at the time the agency announced in July that it would investigate claims of hair loss, hair breakage, balding, itching, and rashes.\u00a0 That number has since grown to more than 1,000 reports, but it\u2019s still a huge difference between the reports that the company received versus FDA. Yet that company, that personal care products company, is not   to report to the FDA about adverse events. And I believe that is a key weakness in the current law. \u201cUnderstandably, there is significant concern from consumers, from salon workers, manufacturers, and health professionals that the current system is failing consumers.\u00a0 I am particularly concerned about the impact on children and on professionals like hair stylists who may be exposed to potentially harmful ingredients in products they use every work day. \u201cTo help address this issue, I have joined Senator Feinstein in introducing our bipartisan Personal Care Products Safety Act, which would modernize our woefully outdated federal regulatory system.\u00a0 As Senator Murray indicated, it\u2019s ironic that we\u2019ve addressed and modernized the FDA in so many other ways, but not in this one. Our bill is the product of consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, as Senator Feinstein has mentioned. And it would give FDA a broader oversight by setting up a basic regulatory structure, with registration of manufacturers and products, with review of ingredients by the FDA, and by a uniform national standard.\u00a0 With the news that a bipartisan House companion bill has been released, we are encouraged that this effort is gaining more support and resonating with the American public. \u201cWhile our bill is endorsed by a diverse and growing coalition of groups, including companies and consumer and health organizations, there are some small, artisan soap and homemade cosmetic producers have expressed concern.\u00a0 Given that, I would like to clear up some misconceptions about our bill and mention provisions that aim to help protect small companies. \u201cFirst, only soap products that make cosmetic claims would be included in the new system.\u00a0 Second, individuals or small companies selling less than $100,000 in products annually would   be required to register with the FDA.\u00a0 For companies selling between $100,000 and $500,000, there would be a simplified registration process and   user fee.\u00a0 The user fee schedule, similar to that which already exists for drug and device companies and helps to avoid costs to taxpayers, would increase as the size of a company grows.\u00a0 And finally, the FDA and the Small Business Administration would help ensure that compliance is simple and easy to understand. \u201cMr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to testify today.\u00a0 By modernizing the oversight of personal care products that are used so widely by the American public, consumers will be better informed and protected.\u00a0 Thank you.\u201d"},

{"title": "National Falls Prevention Day: Raising Awareness About the Dangers of Falls", "date": ["Posted Mon, 09/26/2016 - 15:26"], "release": "September 22, 2016, marked the first day of the fall season, a time to enjoy Maine\u2019s beautiful foliage and crisp weather. It also was National Falls Prevention Day, a time to better educate seniors, families, and caregivers \u2013 as well as government and civic organizations \u2013 about the practices, programs, and policies that can be taken to reduce the risk of falls. As Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I introduced the Senate Resolution calling for this designation \u2013 along with the Committee\u2019s Ranking Member, Senator Claire McCaskill \u2013 to highlight the fact that falls are the leading cause of both fatal and nonfatal injuries among older adults. Older adults are the fastest-growing segment of the United States\u2019 population, and the number is projected to increase from 46.2 million in 2014 to 82.3 million in 2040. As more Americans age, falls will become even more numerous and costly than they are now. In 2014, approximately 2.8 million older Americans were treated in emergency rooms after falling, and more than 800,000 were subsequently hospitalized. Tragically, more than 27,000 of them died as a result of their injuries. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts these staggering statistics in a context that really brings the problem home: one out of every three seniors falls each year; every 13 seconds, a senior is treated in an emergency room for a fall; every 20 seconds, a senior dies from a fall. In addition to the human toll, these falls generate enormous economic costs. The annual total direct medical cost of fall-related injuries for older adults is approximately $34 billion. As more members of the Baby Boomer generation reach retirement age, these costs could nearly double within the next five years. Beyond the pain, suffering, and expense, falls can affect a senior\u2019s ability to live independently and can lead to a compromised quality of life, and thus to isolation and depression. Many people who fall, even if they are not injured, can develop a fear of falling. This may cause them to limit their activities, resulting in reduced mobility and physical activity. As a Senator representing the state with the oldest median age, I am especially concerned that Maine is eighth in the nation in the percentage of seniors who suffer falls. Seniors in Maine who fall experience an average medical cost of approximately $16,000, according to the most recent statistics available. Fortunately, there are many organizations throughout Maine, including several Area Agencies on Aging, that provide important fall prevention programs. Our resolution urges relevant federal, state, and local organizations to work to help educate seniors about ways they can reduce the risks that may result from a fall, including injury and even death. The resolution also recognizes that evidence-based programs reduce falls by using cost-effective strategies, such as exercise programs, medication management, vision improvement, reduction of home hazards, and fall prevention education. Family members and other caregivers can also help seniors evaluate their homes for fall-inducing hazards and modify their living space with adequate lighting and assistive devices, such as grab bars in the shower or tub, to help ensure a safe environment. There are more steps we can take. The costs of even minor modifications like grab bars and hand rails can add up quickly, while more expensive projects such as widening doorways or installing a ramp are financially unrealistic for far too many seniors. Several existing federal programs can help seniors make these needed modifications to their homes, but few seniors are aware of them. To address this issue, I have joined Senators Angus King of Maine and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire in sponsoring the Senior Home Modification Assistance Initiative Act, which would improve awareness and better coordinate existing federal programs. Falling is not an inevitable consequence of aging. Practical lifestyle adjustments, evidence-based prevention programs, community partnerships, and continued research are among the tools available to reduce falls. Fall-related injuries have a devastating impact on the lives of our seniors, their families, and their communities. Our goal is to unite professionals, older adults, caregivers, and family members so that they might all play a part in raising awareness and preventing falls."},

{"title": "Maximizing Social Security Benefits: The Most Important Financial Decision Most Americans Will Ever Make", "date": ["Posted Fri, 09/16/2016 - 09:06"], "release": " \u2014 If someone offered me $100 today, no strings attached, I\u2019d be tempted to accept it and say thank you. But, if I were told that if I just waited until next week, I could receive $200 instead \u2013 I think most of us would agree that it might make sense to wait. This example is over-simplified, but essentially, this is how our Social Security system works for those who qualify for retirement benefits. Deciding at what age to begin claiming Social Security retirement benefits is the single most important financial decision that many Americans will ever make. Few, however, understand that making the wrong choice can end up costing them tens of thousands of dollars, or more, dseruring their retirement years. As Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, one of my priorities is improving the retirement security of the American people. Social Security benefits make up the largest component of retirement income for the majority of American households, so it is vital to ensure that seniors have the accurate, clear, and consistent information they need to fully understand the Social Security rules that govern their decisions on when to begin receiving these benefits. This important issue was the subject of a recent Committee hearing that I chaired. Retirees are entitled to claim benefits as early as age 62, and for many retirees, that makes sense; either they\u2019re in poor health, or their jobs are too physically demanding for them to continue to work. But those who are able to work and nevertheless claim their benefits at age 62 will see their annual benefits permanently reduced by nearly one-third compared to what they could have received by waiting until they\u2019re older. In fact, benefits can go up by eight percent annually for each year that seniors delay claiming benefits, up to the age of 70. For example, the average person in Maine, earning $42,000 a year, would receive about $1,200 a month from Social Security if he or she retired when they first became eligible at age 62. But if this person is able to keep earning a paycheck until the age of 66, he or she could then receive $1,600 a month in Social Security retirement benefits. And, if the person remains in good health, can work, and is fortunate enough to be able to wait until age 70 to begin claiming benefits, this senior could receive a check for $2,112 a month. That\u2019s nearly $1,000 more each and every month -- $12,000 more every year than if the senior had started receiving benefits eight years earlier. I am concerned that many Americans may be unfamiliar with this aspect of the Social Security program, leading some of them to make a costly mistake. In March 2015, Senator Claire McCaskill and I requested that the Government Accountability Office, Congress\u2019 investigative arm, study ways in which the Social Security Administration can improve and clarify the information it provides to eligible individuals to help ensure that they have a complete understanding of the factors that will affect their retirement benefits. The GAO released its study for the first time at our hearing, along with six recommendations on ways the Social Security Administration can improve the information it provides to seniors. The GAO found that many individuals do not fully understand key details of Social Security\u2019s rules that can affect their retirement benefits. Nor do they understand how spousal and survivor benefits are determined. Many may not realize just how long their financial assets may need to last. For example, a 65-year old today can expect to live for another 20 to 25 years, and one in four will live past age 90. As the GAO report details, the Social Security Administration does make a great deal of information available to the public. Unfortunately, this information is not always easy to digest, and is sometimes conflicting. The six recommendations focus on better ensuring that Social Security field offices consistently provide the information that claimants need to make well-informed decisions about their benefits. Our nation faces a retirement crisis. The simple fact is that far too many Americans have not saved enough money to live comfortably in retirement. Many of these retirees will rely on Social Security for nearly all of their income. For them, a Social Security check that is at the maximum level for which they are eligible could make the difference between a secure retirement and living in poverty. I am hopeful that the GAO\u2019s report, and our Committee\u2019s focus on this issue, will encourage the Social Security Administration to take additional steps to present essential information that seniors need, in a clear, easy to understand manner, so that they can make the best possible decision for themselves."},

Retirees are entitled to claim benefits as early as age 62, but those who do so will see their annual benefits permanently reduced by nearly one-third compared to what they could have received by waiting until they\u2019re older. In fact, few people realize that their benefits can go up by eight percent annually for each year they delay claiming benefits, up to the age of 70. For example, an average individual earning $42,000 per year and filing at age 62 would receive approximately $1,200 per month from Social Security. If this person is able to keep working until age 70, however, his or her monthly benefit could reach $2,112\u2014an additional $912 per month. Chairman Collins and Ranking Member McCaskill have expressed concern that many Americans may be unfamiliar with this aspect of the Social Security program, leading them to make a costly mistake. In March 2015, the   that the GAO study ways in which the Social Security Administration can improve and clarify the information it provides to eligible individuals to ensure that they have a complete understanding of the factors that will affect their retirement benefits. The   for the first time at today\u2019s hearing along with six recommendations on ways the Social Security Administration (SSA) can improve the ways it provides information to seniors. The SSA generally agreed with the GAO\u2019s recommendations. \u201cThe decision on when to claim Social Security benefits is, for many Americans, the most important financial decision that they will ever make. Most Americans don\u2019t realize the enormous implications of choosing one age versus another. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so insistent that there be accurate and complete information,\u201d  \u201cI believe SSA can do more to clarify these key points, and I look forward to seeing those recommendations implemented.\u201d \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take a financial professional to impart the basic message we are talking about today,\u201d  \u201cEvery person who claims benefits must interact with SSA, so this is our last stop to inform people about the advantages of waiting. We hope SSA will see it is in all of our interests to make sure the public is fully educated on this issue.\u201d Social Security benefits make up the largest component of retirement income for a majority of American households. Deciding when to begin receiving these benefits is one of the most important financial choices many people will ever make. While there are a number of factors seniors must consider as they approach their retirement years, including health or the physical demands of work, it is vital to ensure that seniors have accurate, clear, and consistent information they need to fully understand the Social Security rules that govern these decisions.

I am pleased to announce that, at my request, this legislation greenlights an important navigation project for the Portsmouth Harbor and the Piscataqua River. At present the Portsmouth Harbor handles nearly 3.5 million tons of shipping each year through a turning basin and waterway that are far too narrow for such a large volume of commerce. This project would increase both safety and efficiency by constructing a wider turning basin that will serve the terminals on the upper section of the Piscataqua River, as well as by widening the waterway at several bends and bridges. \u201cIn addition, this legislation includes a provision I requested that will keep the Cape Arundel Disposal Site open for an additional 5 years. Keeping this site open would help allow sufficient time for the region to obtain a permanent designation by the EPA for this site or another to replace it. Disposal sites in close proximity are crucial for successful dredging projects along the Maine coast that keep our ports and harbors clear, safe, and open for business.\u201d This bipartisan legislation authorizes: more than $9 billion in funding for major water infrastructure improvements nationwide; $220 million in aid to alleviate the drinking water crisis in Flint and other cities with excess lead levels in their drinking water systems; and nearly 30 new Corps water infrastructure projects.

Direct support professionals provide an invaluable service by caring for the most vulnerable among us, including seniors, people living with disabilities, and the chronically ill. Through the efforts of this essential health care workforce, these individuals are able to live, work, and fully participate in their communities. There is a critical and increasing shortage of direct support professionals throughout the United States. \u201cDirect Support Professionals truly help strengthen our communities by providing those in need with critical support that leads to more independent living and a better quality of life. These professionals deserve our thanks and recognition, and I was pleased to join Senator Cardin in co-authoring the \u2018National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week\u2019 Resolution,\u201d  Direct support professional job titles vary, and include in-home support worker, personal assistant, home health aide, job coach, direct support worker, and independent living skills instructor. These supports are essential across the lifespan to ensure that people who rely on supports can live healthy, safe lives as contributing members of their communities. However, low wages, limited training, and little recognition of the skilled work they do leads to high turnover among direct support professionals.

The resolution language follows: SENATE RESOLUTION 559 Title: Designating the week of September 12, 2016, as ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week''. Whereas direct support professionals, including direct care workers, personal assistants, personal attendants, in-home support workers, and paraprofessionals, are key to providing publicly funded, long-term support and services for millions of individuals with disabilities; Whereas direct support professionals provide essential support to help keep individuals with disabilities connected to their families, friends, and communities so as to avoid more costly institutional care; Whereas direct support professionals support individuals with disabilities by helping those individuals make person-centered choices that lead to meaningful, productive lives; Whereas direct support professionals must build close, respectful, and trusted relationships with individuals with disabilities; Whereas direct support professionals provide a broad range of individualized support to individuals with disabilities, including\u2014 (1) assisting with the preparation of meals; (2) helping with medication; (3) assisting with bathing, dressing, and other aspects of daily living; (4) assisting with access to their environment; (5) providing transportation to school, work, religious, and recreational activities; and (6) helping with general daily affairs, such as assisting with financial matters, medical appointments, and personal interests; Whereas the participation of direct support professionals in medical care planning is critical to the successful transition of individuals from medical events to post-acute care and long-term support and services; Whereas there is a documented critical and increasing shortage of direct support professionals throughout the United States; Whereas direct support professionals are a critical element in supporting individuals who are receiving health care services for severe chronic health conditions and individuals with functional limitations; Whereas many direct support professionals are the primary financial providers for their families; Whereas direct support professionals are hardworking, taxpaying citizens who provide an important service to people with disabilities in the United States, yet many continue to earn low wages, receive inadequate benefits, and have limited opportunities for advancement, resulting in high turnover and vacancy rates that adversely affect the quality of support, safety, and health of individuals with disabilities; Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States, in Olmstead v. L.C. by Zimring, 527 U.S. 581 (June 22, 1999)\u2014 (1) recognized the importance of the deinstitutionalization of, and community-based services for, individuals with disabilities; and (2) held that, under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S. 12101 et seq.), a State must provide community-based services to persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities if\u2014 (A) the community-based services are appropriate; (B) the affected person does not oppose receiving the community-based services; and (C) the community-based services can be reasonably accommodated after the community has taken into account the resources available to the State and the needs of other individuals with disabilities in the State; and Whereas, in 2016, the majority of direct support professionals are employed in home- and community-based settings and that trend will increase over the next decade: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate\u2014 (1) designates the week of September 12, 2016, as \u201cNational Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week\u201d; (2) recognizes and appreciates the contribution, dedication, and vital role of direct support professionals in enhancing the lives of individuals with disabilities of all ages; (3) commends direct support professionals for being integral to the provision of long-term support and services for individuals with disabilities; and (4) finds that the successful implementation of the public policies affecting individuals with disabilities in the United States depends on the dedication of direct support professionals."},

With more than $200 million worth of live American lobster exported from North America to the EU annually, a ban would have serious effects on both Maine\u2019s economy and thousands of our constituents\u2019 livelihoods\u2014not to mention commensurate losses for distribution, retail, and restaurant businesses in EU member nations. We again write to you with our serious concern for the lack of compelling science in Sweden\u2019s petition to prohibit the importation of live   (American lobster) to the European Union and the socioeconomic effects it could have in the EU and North America. While we remain disappointed the issue was not laid to rest at the Scientific Forum\u2019s meeting in late-June, we are glad the Forum requested that Sweden update its risk assessment (RA) regarding stated concerns about the science. Sweden\u2019s RA should be held to the high scientific scrutiny that is provided for in EU Regulation. As we noted in our June letter to you, the U.S. Department of Commerce and its Canadian counterpart provided ample scientific evidence with respect to the very low risk that American lobster poses as an invasive alien species. As the Scientific Committee weighs Sweden\u2019s petition, we request that the RA continue to be measured against the best available peer-reviewed science and that alternative targeted mitigation solutions be considered to address this perceived risk. We also urge you to consider the economic repercussions that the proposed ban would have.

They have the potential not only to improve health outcomes for individuals with diabetes but also to reduce long-term health expenditures from costly complications,\u201d   \u201cFurther investment in the Special Diabetes Program is essential to continue vital large-scale trials, plan next steps for research programs, and most effectively allocate research resources\u2014all of which play an important part in helping to better treat, prevent, and ultimately cure type 1 diabetes.\u201d In addition to the human toll, diabetes cost the United States $245 billion in 2012, and it has been estimated that the number of Americans living with the disease will double and the related health care costs will nearly triple by 2035. More than one in five health care dollars and one in three Medicare dollars are currently spent on care for people with diabetes. Fortunately, the Special Diabetes Program is advancing research to cure, treat, and prevent type 1 diabetes. It is also helping to prevent and treat diabetes in the American Indian and Alaska Native community, while yielding a strong return on investment. A number of notable developments can be attributed to the Special Diabetes Program, including progress on an artificial pancreas system, which will reduce costly and burdensome type 1 diabetes complications and improve quality of life for those with the disease; discovery that intensive blood glucose control can significantly reduce the onset of impaired kidney function; and other promising research. The program will expire next year if not reauthorized by Congress. The Special Diabetes Program consists of two components: the Special Statutory Funding Program for Type 1 Diabetes Research which supports research to prevent, treat, and cure type 1 diabetes and its complications; and the Special Diabetes Program for Indians which supports diabetes treatment and prevention strategies for American Indian and Alaska Native populations who are disproportionately burdened with Type 2 diabetes at a rate of 2.8 times the national average.

{"title": "Collins, King Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Authorize Delayed VA Medical Lease for Outpatient Facility in Portland", "date": ["Posted Wed, 09/21/2016 - 11:18"], "release": "\u00a0\u2013 U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King today joined Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) in introducing the  , bipartisan legislation that would authorize leases for 24 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities in fifteen states, including an outpatient facility in Portland, Maine. The proposed clinic, a joint partnership between Maine VA, Maine Medical Center and Tufts School of Medicine, aims to increase veterans\u2019 access to core and specialty care services including integrated mental health and telemedicine technology to improve access to care in rural locations. \u201cMaine veterans deserve convenient access to high-quality health care services, but the longer this lease remains unauthorized, the longer veterans may have to wait to receive care \u2013 and that is unacceptable,\u201d  . \u201cCongress needs to take action to ensure that we live up to the solemn promise we made to our nation\u2019s veterans. Passing this bill would be a good first step.\u201d Under current law, the VA must receive specific legislative authorization to lease medical facilities with average annual rental payments in excess of $1 million. However, since 2012, Congress has not, through a regular process, authorized any VA major medical facility leases, hampering the ability of the VA to provide much-needed health care and services to veterans around the country.  will authorize 18 overdue leases from Fiscal Year 2015 and Fiscal Year 2016, as well as six facilities that need to be authorized in the rapidly approaching 2017 Fiscal Year. The 24 leases are located in states with an estimated 11 million veterans. Under current law, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must receive specific legislative authorization to lease medical facilities with average annual rental payments in excess of $1 million. However, since 2012, Congress has not, through a regular process, authorized any VA major medical facility leases, hampering the ability of the VA to provide much-needed health care and services to veterans around the country.  will authorize 18 overdue leases from Fiscal Year 2015 and Fiscal Year 2016, as well as six facilities that need to be authorized in the rapidly approaching 2017 Fiscal Year. The 24 leases are located in states with an estimated 11 million veterans. One reason for the delay in Congressional authorization has been a recent change in the way that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scores these leases. Prior to 2012, the VA classified major medical facility leases as operating leases and recorded the obligations on an annual basis in an amount equal to the lease payments due in that year, and the CBO used VA\u2019s classification to score the legislation. In 2012, CBO determined that budget authority for these leases, many of which cover a 20-year period, should be recorded up front when the leases are initiated and the acquisition occurs, not when the debt is repaid. As such, scoring for legislation that authorized these leases increased significantly, even though actual spending would not increase and the leases are ultimately subject to annual appropriations. Senators Collins and King, along with several of their colleagues,   the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs not to delay further on the lease authorizations. The scoring change has contributed to congressional inaction on authorizing any VA major medical facility leases. Currently, 18 leases in 12 states from fiscal years 2015 and 2016 have been pending authorization in Congress for more than one year. The CBO scores the overall cost of these 18 leases at $904 million. The 18 leases that are pending from FY 2015 and FY 2016 are: In addition, the legislation will authorize six leases for FY 2017: Other cosponsors of the legislation include Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

Collins, Warner Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Assist Small Businesses in Offering Retirement Plans to Employees", "date": ["Posted Fri, 09/09/2016 - 11:54"], "release": " \u2014 U.S. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, and Mark Warner (D-VA), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, introduced bipartisan legislation that would reduce duplicative filing costs for small businesses looking to offer retirement plans to their employees and sole-proprietors. \u201cAmericans simply aren\u2019t saving enough to be able to afford a comfortable retirement. In fact, the Center for Retirement Research estimates that there is an estimated $7.7 trillion gap between what Americans have saved for retirement and what they will actually need,\u201d said Sen. Collins. \u201cWe know that when employers provide their employees with access to retirement plans, approximately 80 percent of them contribute. Our legislation will help promote retirement security by making it easier and less expensive for small businesses to establish retirement plans, increasing their accessibility to employees and helping to ensure that those who worked hard for decades do not spend their retirement in poverty.\u201d \u201cIncreasing access to workplace retirement plans is a crucial step in providing a secure retirement to millions of Americans,\u201d said Sen. Warner. \u201cWhen workers have access to a retirement plan through their employer, nearly 80 percent choose to participate \u2013 compared to just 10 percent who do without access through their employers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As the nature of work continues to change, I am pleased to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senator Collins to make it easier for small businesses to offer this important benefit to their employees.\u201d A 2016 report by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that only 22 percent of workers at small firms have access to a workplace savings plan or pension, compared to 74 percent at firms with 500 or more employees. For smaller employers, offering a retirement plan can be expensive and complex. S. 3307 directs the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Treasury Department to allow employers and sole-proprietors participating in retirement plans administered the same way to file a single aggregated Form 5500, a required annual return that provides important compliance information to DOL and Treasury. Under current law, despite sharing a common administrative framework, each individual plan is still required to file a separate Form 5500 to satisfy reporting requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code. S. 3307 will eliminate duplicative reporting by plan administrators, which will reduce costs for small businesses that maintain retirement plans. To file an aggregated Form 5500, the retirement plans would need to have the same trustee, fiduciary, plan administrator, plan year and investment menu. To provide DOL and Treasury time to implement this change, the proposal has an effective date of no later than January 1, 2020. A copy of the legislative text is available  ."},

Even in this highly charged political environment, it is still possible to find members in both parties who understand that compromise does not mean betraying one\u2019s principles,\u201d  \u201cSenator Jacob Javits handed us the beacon of reason and service. We must all do our part to carry it forward.\u201d Senator Collins is well known for her willingness to reach across the aisle to achieve bipartisan consensus on some of our nation\u2019s most pressing issues. In both the 113th and 114th Congresses, she was ranked as the most bipartisan member of the U.S. Senate by the Lugar Center and Georgetown University. The Jacob K. Javits Prize for Bipartisan Leadership was established in 2016 by the Marian B. and Jacob K. Javits Foundation. The Foundation was created in 1986 by Jacob Javits, a former U.S. Senator from New York who served in Congress for more than three decades. The annual award honors public servants whose achievements advance the public interest. The award is bestowed on those who do the most to overcome the partisan gridlock undermining Congress\u2019 ability to function on behalf of the American people, preventing the government from addressing the immense problems confronting our country. Senator Collins was the first individual selected to receive this award. The 2016 National Opportunity Summit, where the award was presented to Senator Collins, convened a bipartisan, cross-sector group of business leaders, nonprofits, elected officials and young people to expand economic opportunity and restore the American Dream. Approximately 1,000 people attended the event."},

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) recently determined that Wells Fargo employees had illegally opened millions of accounts that consumers had never requested in order to boost individual performance goals and bonuses.\u00a0 The CFPB said that Wells Fargo employees applied for approximately 565,000 credit cards and 1.5 million deposit accounts that may not have been authorized by consumers\u2014sometimes illegally transferring money into those accounts in order to make them active. This sometimes resulted in overdraft or late fee charges for affected consumers. Wells Fargo was ordered to pay $185 million in fines to various entities, including a $100 million fine to the CFPB. \u201cWe have concerns about the impact this activity has had on our nation\u2019s senior population, especially those who do not conduct their financial business on the Internet. According to Pew Research Center, just 56 percent of adults over age 65 use the Internet,\u201d the Senators said in their letter to CFPB Director Richard Cordray. They also asked if CFPB had worked with other branches of government to pursue civil or criminal penalties against the employees engaged in fraud.

The Senators also requested any analysis used by Mylan relating to the pricing or market share of EpiPen\u00ae since 2007, along with any information reviewed or generated by Mylan\u2019s Board of Directors relating to the drug over the same period.

We are concerned that these drastic price increases could have a serious effect on the health and well-being of every day Americans.\u00a0 There have been numerous accounts of individuals who are simply unable to afford this lifesaving medication and as a consequence have gone without, risked using an expired product, or resorted to uncertain (but less expensive) treatments.

As the Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee in the Senate, one of my highest priorities has been to improve our nation\u2019s infrastructure and to ensure that Maine\u2019s needs are addressed.\u00a0 I recently secured grant funding for two important projects in Maine\u2014one for a rural island bridge, the other for our busiest seaport\u2014which will enhance the safety and efficiency of our state\u2019s transportation network and create and sustain good-paying jobs.\u00a0 These grants will allow construction to begin on the replacement of the Beals Island Bridge and to improve the infrastructure at the Port of Portland.\u00a0 The projects are expected to directly generate approximately 475 construction jobs, but the positive effects will be felt throughout our state.\u00a0 In addition to those in construction fields, many other workers are employed by companies that provide products and services to support the projects, including steel, concrete, trucking, fuel, meals, and lodging.\u00a0 Moreover, these transportation projects will make it easier for Mainers traveling to jobs and help goods from Maine businesses reach the market. Whether directly or indirectly, these infrastructure improvements will support families and communities. The Beals Island Bridge is the only crossing that connects the island and town of Beals with the mainland at Jonesport, handling roughly 2,000 vehicles each day.\u00a0 Nearly 60 years old, the narrow bridge has been deemed structurally deficient and in need of replacement. The award of $10.5 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation through the successful Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant program will allow the Maine Department of Transportation to move forward with the $21.7 million project to increase public safety and connectivity between the island and the mainland.\u00a0 The TIGER program was established in 2009 to provide federal assistance for vital transportation projects.\u00a0 Since its inception, I have worked\u00a0each year to ensure that the program has been funded and have strongly advocated for\u00a0the projects submitted by the Maine Department of Transportation.\u00a0 I have been able to successfully secure more than $122 million through the TIGER program for key highway, bridge, port, and rail projects throughout Maine, including the replacements of bridges in Kittery, Dresden-Richmond, and Rumford, as well as the breakwater in Eastport and improvements in all three of Maine\u2019s major ports in Portland, Searsport, and Eastport.\u00a0 A TIGER grant also helped save freight rail service in Northern Maine.\u00a0 The TIGER grant program has made a significant difference in our state, providing funding for vital projects across Maine that might otherwise never have been built. A separate $7.7 million grant through the FASTLANE program will help fund improvements at the Port of Portland and will employ about 200 construction workers, increase competitiveness for Maine businesses, and provide an economic boost and job opportunities throughout our state.\u00a0 Specific projects at the Port of Portland will consist of removing an existing maintenance facility, installing a new mobile harbor crane and other cargo handling equipment, constructing a highway and rail crossing upgrade, and building a terminal operations and maintenance center. The Port of Portland, the busiest seaport in Maine, is used daily by businesses and customers across Maine, including L.L.\u00a0Bean, Poland Spring water, Aroostook potato growers, and Bristol Seafood.\u00a0 Currently, much cargo is offloaded at Canadian ports and transported to the United States via truck.\u00a0 By addressing the capacity and infrastructure needs at the Port of Portland, the project will improve freight mobility and relieve highway congestion between Portland and Canadian ports.\u00a0 Improvements for the railroads at the port and the rail line serving the port will allow for expansion of intermodal service. Whether in a small town or a major hub of commerce, projects such as these have the immediate benefit of keeping our skilled construction workers on the job.\u00a0 When complete, they help enhance safety, grow the economy, and create opportunity.\u00a0\u00a0 Improving transportation in Maine requires a strong partnership at the federal, state, and local levels. Working with our state, our communities, and the private sector, I will continue to advocate for responsible investments to improve our nation\u2019s aging infrastructure."},

This letter directly responds to a new security measure instituted by the SSA that seeks to help prevent identify theft. This measure requires a user to receive a text message authentication code in order to log into his or her \u201cmy Social Security\u201d account online. While noting the need for enhanced security, Senators Collins and McCaskill raised concerns that using text message authentication as the   means of guaranteeing an individual\u2019s access to his or her account puts an undue burden on our seniors, many of whom do not own a cell phone.\u00a0 To prevent seniors across our country from being unable to access their accounts, U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Claire McCaskill sent a letter to SSA Acting Commissioner Carolyn Colvin calling on the agency to \u201cconsider the effect of this policy on the beneficiaries SSA is intended to serve\u201d and ask \u201cthat [they] provide, as quickly as possible, additional authentication options\u201d to \u201callow all seniors to have safe and speedy access to their own accounts.\u201d Click   to read the signed letter.\u00a0 The full text of the letter is below: August 12, 2016 Carolyn W. Colvin Acting Commissioner Social Security Administration 6401 Security Boulevard Baltimore, MD 21235-0001 Dear Acting Commissioner Colvin: We write to express our concern with the recent decision from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to use text message authentication as the only means of guaranteeing an individual\u2019s access to his or her online \u201cmy Social Security\u201d account.\u00a0 The new policy puts a high burden on America\u2019s seniors, many of whom may not own a cell phone.\u00a0 We urge you to adopt additional identification verification methods that are accessible to a broader range of Social Security recipients while retaining essential security. As the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Aging Committee, we understand the need for enhanced security to protect seniors against fraud, and we strongly support this goal.\u00a0 Far too many older Americans are being financially exploited by strangers over the telephone, through the mail, and online.\u00a0 From that perspective, we understand the rationale behind the July 30, 2016, agency implementation of mandatory Multifactor Authentication.\u00a0 We also recognize that this action was taken to adhere with Executive Order 13681, which requires federal agencies to provide more secure authentication for their online services. The methods for stronger fraud protection, however, must be considered relative to the needs and circumstances of the target population.\u00a0 According to a 2014 study from Pew Research Center, almost a quarter of people age 65 and older in the United States do not have a cell phone. In addition, a significant number of Americans lack access to reliable cell phone service.\u00a0 On top of both of those factors, many disabled and older Americans receiving Social Security are not as technologically savvy as other segments of the population. Even when seniors can receive texts, they may still be unable to access their accounts.\u00a0 For example, the SSA website showed a notice on August 2, 2016, that due to high volume of traffic, users may have experienced problems receiving security codes.\u00a0 The lack of alternate identification methods effectively locks users out of their own accounts and could prevent them from accessing necessary information or making important account changes. Given the concerns detailed above, we urge you to consider the effect of this policy on the beneficiaries SSA is intended to serve, and we ask that you provide, as quickly as possible, additional authentication options.\u00a0 We look forward to working with you to find additional verification methods that will allow all seniors to have safe and speedy access to their own accounts.\u00a0 We would also welcome a staff briefing to discuss your agency\u2019s efforts both to provide security to account holders and to ensure they have easy access to their accounts.

As the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I was concerned that this decision would have placed a high burden on seniors, many of whom do not own a cell phone or may have a phone that does not receive or send data.\u00a0 I immediately asked my colleague Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO), the Ranking Member of the Committee, to join me in writing a letter to the Social Security Administration.\u00a0 Our letter urged Acting Commissioner Carolyn Colvin to reconsider its policy and provide alternative identification verification methods that retain security but are more accessible to Social Security recipients. \u00a0 As a result of our letter and of the concerns expressed by seniors across the country, the Social Security Administration removed the text messaging requirement.\u00a0 Instead, text message verification will be preserved as an option, and the SSA will develop additional security measures for those who lack access to a \u201csmart\u201d phone.

While Mylan has announced it will offer more generous patient financial assistance and that it will begin marketing a less-expensive product, it appears that assistance may be inadequate and presented in a manner that could be misleading to consumers.\u00a0 In addition to the individual Americans who are harmed by these price increases, local school districts and taxpayers are also affected, as many schools stock epinephrine auto-injectors to protect students.\u00a0 Federal law actually encourages schools to maintain an emergency supply of epinephrine.\u00a0 In addition, older Americans are at risk for more severe anaphylactic reaction and also rely on EpiPen. Joined by the Aging Committee\u2019s Ranking Member, Senator Claire McCaskill, I have written to Mylan CEO Heather Bresch asking for information about the drastic price increase of EpiPen and requesting that Mylan provide a briefing.\u00a0 We have requested any analyses used by Mylan relating to the pricing and market share of EpiPen, along with any information reviewed or generated by the company\u2019s Board of Directors related to the drug.\u00a0 When the patent expires on EpiPen, one factor that will help drive down costs for patients is ensuring there is a market for generic competitors.\u00a0 We need policy reforms, such as the bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senator McCaskill, to ensure that the review and approval of certain generic drugs can be fast-tracked. I am committed to obtaining answers regarding this drastic price increase, which I believe could have a serious effect on the health and well-being of everyday Americans and hinder the efforts of the Good Samaritans among us, like Kate Charak.\u00a0 I will continue to work with my colleagues on bipartisan solutions that will protect the American public from price manipulation, increase competition, and keep life-saving medications affordable."},

{"title": "Collins Leads Bipartisan Senators, including King, in urging CMS to Expand Substance Abuse Treatment Coverage ", "date": ["Posted Tue, 08/02/2016 - 14:43"], "release": " \u2013 U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Dick Durbin (D-IL) today led a bipartisan group of 29 senators, including Senator Angus King, in urging the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to improve access to substance abuse treatment by modifying the Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) Exclusion.\u00a0 The IMD Exclusion currently limits options for individuals seeking substance abuse treatment by prohibiting federal reimbursement for services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries between ages 22 and 64 in certain settings, including residential mental health and substance use disorder treatment facilities with over 16 beds.\u00a0 \u00a0In a letter to CMS Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt, the senators asked the agency to use existing authorities to provide greater flexibility in order to ensure patient access to medically necessary substance abuse treatment. The letter was also signed by Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Rob Portman (R-OH), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Mark Kirk (R-IL), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Bob Casey (D-PA), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Diane Feinstein (D-CA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Al Franken (D-MN), and Cory Booker (D-NJ). The Honorable Andy Slavitt Acting Administrator Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 7500 Security Boulevard Baltimore, MD 21244 Dear Administrator Slavitt: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In December 2014, 18 bipartisan Senators wrote to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding the Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) Exclusion, which prohibits federal financial participation (FFP) for services furnished in an IMD setting to adults age 22-64 years. This existing policy limits treatment for those who need it most, is clinically inappropriate for proper care, and is rooted in an outdated definition of mental health. In light of the ongoing heroin and prescription opioid epidemic that is impacting communities across the nation, we urge CMS to take additional steps, utilizing existing authorities, to provide greater flexibility in ensuring patient access to medically necessary evidence-based substance abuse treatment. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Over the past two decades, CMS has taken important strides to expand eligibility, protect benefits, and improve provider capacity for the coverage of substance use disorder (SUD) services in Medicaid. The emergence of coordinated and integrated service delivery models that include behavioral health care services in Medicaid have improved outcomes and reduced costs. We also applaud CMS for its leadership in identifying innovative approaches to expand access to SUD treatment, through recent measures including the July 2015 1115 waiver guidance letter, the focus of the Innovation Accelerator Program on SUD treatment, the March 2016 mental health and SUD parity final rule, and the April 2016 Medicaid managed care final rule. Specifically, we commend CMS on the acknowledgement that the IMD Exclusion poses a barrier to beneficiary access to SUD treatment, and for incorporating new tools to mitigate the effect of this policy. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 However, we remain concerned that these measures may be insufficient to respond to the opioid epidemic and will not afford enough states the opportunity to enact meaningful changes for beneficiaries. For example, only one state has received approval from CMS for an 1115 waiver for SUD treatment overhauls, whereas many states have indicated an inability to marshal the resources to undertake such a broad, budget-neutral proposal. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore, the recent managed care rule only allows for 15 days of care furnished in an IMD setting over a 30-day period to be eligible for FFP, and it is our understanding that only American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Level 4 facilities are eligible. We have serious concerns about limiting eligibility to medically managed intensive inpatient care settings, while precluding all types of Level 3 residential treatment facilities when such settings may be more clinically appropriate.\u00a0 Further, we question whether a 15-day length of stay is evidence-based for SUD treatment, considering numerous studies suggesting the cost-savings, readmissions reductions, overdose preventions, and recovery efficacy from longer lengths of stay in residential settings as a patient progresses down the clinical continuum of care. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CMS\u2019 recent mental health and SUD parity final rule extends certain protections from the Wellstone-Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 to Medicaid managed care organizations. CMS noted in its fact sheet that this final rule \u201chelps to prevent inequity between beneficiaries who have mental health or substance use disorder conditions in the commercial market and Medicaid.\u201d We seek clarification from CMS on whether the IMD Exclusion can be justified given these parity laws and regulations, especially considering the fact that Medicaid beneficiaries are not covered for medically necessary treatment within settings that play an important role within the continuum of care. Such an exclusion appears to be discriminatory to the estimated 12 percent of adult Medicaid beneficiaries ages 18-64 who have SUDs. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our nation is in the midst of a heroin and prescription opioid epidemic that has shined a spotlight on barriers to patient access to life-saving care.\u00a0 Improved understanding of addiction pathologies has also informed novel therapies, and patients with SUDs can now manage addiction and reach recovery using medication-assisted treatments.\u00a0 There are numerous Congressional efforts underway seeking to address this issue, but we strongly urge CMS to use existing authorities to broaden treatment opportunities, such as by removing SUD treatment and facilities from the IMD Exclusion. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We look forward to your timely response. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sincerely,"},

Box 15437 Wilmington, DE 19850-5437 Dear Mr. Soriot: We would like to better understand AstraZeneca\u2019s position that generic competitors to Crestor\u00ae should be delayed from entering the market. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted AstraZeneca seven year exclusivity for Crestor under the Orphan Drug Act for the express purpose of treating children for a rare pediatric genetic disorder.\u00a0 As we understand it, Astra Zeneca does not dispute that, on the face of the Orphan Drug Act, this seven year exclusionary period only applies to the orphan indication affecting approximately 300 U.S. patients.\u00a0 Despite this, AstraZeneca filed a Citizen Petition seeking to block the FDA from approving any generic version of Crestor, effectively expanding exclusivity to cover 20 million U.S. prescriptions.\u00a0 As we understand it, AstraZeneca believes that because of the pediatric exclusivity, the FDA cannot approve a generic version of Crestor unless it creates a different label for the generic version that does not include the protected pediatric indication that exists on the current approved brand name label.\u00a0 AstraZeneca then argues that the FDA cannot approve one label for generic Crestor   the pediatric indication and another label for brand name Crestor   the label for the protected pediatric indication, and consequently, no generic can be approved.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Apparently on these grounds, AstraZeneca has brought suit in U.S. District Court seeking to enjoin the FDA from approving a generic version of Crestor until the period of pediatric exclusivity expires.\u00a0 We question whether AstraZeneca\u2019s apparent position implements the longstanding public policy goal of Congress to allow exclusivity for a defined period of time in exchange for investment in innovative new medications. We have a system that rewards innovation and allows the discovery of new medicines, as well as new uses for existing medicines, that save and improve lives.\u00a0 We applaud AstraZeneca for its work in seeking the pediatric indication of Crestor for children with this rare genetic disorder.\u00a0 While we understand the important role of labeling, we are concerned that AstraZeneca\u2019s interpretation of FDA\u2019s regulations and congressional intent behind the entry of generic medications into the market could lead to substantial harm to patients and taxpayers.\u00a0 Obtaining approval for the treatment of additional indications as a means to hinder the market entry of generics, which would be approved for the treatment of other conditions, is troublesome because a competitive generic marketplace is imperative in order to curtail skyrocketing health care and prescription drug costs.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The lawsuit filed by AstraZeneca against the FDA does not provide the information we need to understand how the public interest would be advanced by creating an additional exclusivity period for 20 million U.S. prescriptions based on a pediatric indication that serves approximately 300 U.S. patients.\u00a0 Further, we would like to better understand why AstraZeneca believes the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA\u2019s regulations compel the conclusion that AstraZeneca be allowed to maintain market exclusivity for all populations being prescribed Crestor, not just the pediatric population.

{"title": "The Critical Response We Need: The Senate Takes Action to Combat the Heroin and Opioid Abuse Epidemic", "date": ["Posted Mon, 07/25/2016 - 12:19"], "release": "In a 24-hour period in June, six people overdosed on opioids in Sanford, one of whom died as a result.\u00a0 In Monmouth, three people overdosed on heroin in one week.\u00a0 And in April, two people died from overdoses in just two days in Biddeford. These tragic cases are a snapshot of our nation\u2019s heroin and opioid abuse epidemic, which has devastated countless families and communities across the country.\u00a0 Maine has been hard hit by this unprecedented addiction crisis, with a record 272 overdose deaths in 2015, the vast majority of which were caused by heroin, fentanyl, or prescription opioids. In addition, a recent survey found that 60 percent of Mainers know someone who has either used heroin or abused prescribed opioid pain relievers within the past five years. The U.S. Senate recently took significant action to address this crisis by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, by an overwhelming vote of 92-2.\u00a0 This bipartisan legislation, which I co-sponsored, will mount an evidence-based response to this devastating epidemic through a multifaceted approach that expands prevention, law enforcement, treatment, and recovery efforts in our communities nationwide. CARA also contains two provisions I co-authored that will help protect infants and seniors from the heroin and opioid abuse crisis.\u00a0 These two populations are often not associated with this epidemic, but are being increasingly affected.\u00a0 In Maine, approximately 1,000 babies were born addicted to or affected by drugs in 2015, which accounts for 1 in 12 births.\u00a0 In addition, earlier this year, I chaired a hearing that examined the medical use of prescription opioids for pain relief and policies that may contribute to our nation\u2019s vast supply of prescription opioids.\u00a0 The provisions I co-wrote include the Infant Plan of Safe Care Act, which will require states to ensure that a plan is developed for drug-dependent infants before they leave the hospital, and the Safe Treatments and Opportunities to Prevent Pain (STOP Pain) Act, which directs the National Institutes of Health to increase research into alternatives to opioid therapy for pain management.\u00a0 Alarmingly, only 10 percent of the 23 million Americans struggling with addiction receive any treatment.\u00a0 Research and considerable clinical experience have demonstrated that buprenorphine can be an effective treatment for some individuals with opioid addiction.\u00a0 Unfortunately, prior to the passage of CARA, only doctors could seek authorization to prescribe buprenorphine for medication assisted treatment, and the number of patients they could treat each year was capped, creating a barrier for many patients.\u00a0 CARA will improve access to this treatment by allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to seek approval to dispense buprenorphine until October 2021.\u00a0 Nurse practitioners and physician assistants are playing increasingly important roles in the delivery of health care, particularly in rural and underserved areas in Maine, and can also play an important role helping individuals to manage and recover from opioid addiction.\u00a0 I strongly backed this provision allowing these health care professionals to provide medication assisted treatment, and I had previously called on the Department of Health and Human Services to consider this change. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have successfully advocated for increased funding to help address the opioid epidemic.\u00a0 In June, the Appropriations Committee approved legislation that included $261 million for the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 opioid abuse initiatives, a 93 percent increase.\u00a0 This May, the Committee unanimously approved a separate appropriations bill, which included an additional $132 million to combat the heroin and opioid abuse crisis.\u00a0 CARA has garnered significant support from medical professionals, those in recovery, law enforcement professionals, and other experts in the field.\u00a0 More than 200 national drug groups, noting that 129 Americans die each day as a result of drug overdose, have endorsed CARA, calling it \u201cthe critical response we need.\u201d\u00a0 CARA is a meaningful step forward in our efforts to combat this crisis and ensure that those struggling with addiction have access to effective, often lifesaving treatments.\u00a0 Earlier this year, I spoke on the Senate floor to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of CARA.\u00a0 During my remarks, I related the story of Garrett Brown, a young man from Augusta whose life was tragically cut short by a heroin overdose.\u00a0 The  , which vividly chronicled his life, described how Garrett\u2019s spiral into addiction ultimately resulted in his death.\u00a0 By better equipping our dedicated health care professionals and increasing access to addiction care for patients, it is my hope that CARA will prevent individuals like Garrett from falling victim to this epidemic of addiction."},

Collins, King Urge USDA to Help Maine Dairy Farmers", "date": ["Posted Thu, 07/28/2016 - 16:13"], "release": "\u00a0\u2013 Today, U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King joined a bipartisan coalition of their colleagues in both the Senate and House to send a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack asking for assistance for dairy producers struggling with declining milk prices. Specifically, the lawmakers asked the USDA to use its existing authorities to expand and maintain U.S. domestic markets, encourage the domestic consumption of dairy products, and help dairy farmers through this financial crisis. \u201cWe are deeply concerned that U.S. dairy farmers, who are a key part of our agriculture community and agriculture economy, are in greater need of stability and support as they face these significantly lower prices,\u201d Senators Collins and King and their colleagues wrote. \u201cWe encourage USDA to take any and all actions available in order to make an immediate market injection and offer financial assistance that will directly support U.S. dairy farmers equally.\u201d Farm milk prices have dropped 40 percent since 2014 due to multiple events \u2013 from an increase in U.S. production levels, to changes in the European Union\u2019s regulation of milk production, to a drop in the export market. In vastly different dairy market regions of the United States, farmers are facing similar margin shortfalls while still adjusting to changes in federal dairy support programs from the 2014 Farm Bill. The complete text of the letter can be read   and is below: +++ July 28, 2016 The Honorable Tom Vilsack Secretary of Agriculture 1400 Independence Avenue, S.W. Washington, D.C. 20250 Dear Secretary Vilsack: We write today to express our concern about the troubling economic challenges facing U.S. dairy farmers and the entire U.S. dairy industry. We have seen farm milk prices drop forty percent since 2014 and in May the nation\u2019s cheese stocks were recorded at their highest level since the data was first recorded in 1917. Current expectations are that the dairy market will continue to struggle with depressed prices and we seek your help as we search for ways to swiftly assist our nation\u2019s struggling dairy farmers. Our dairy farmers have been hit extremely hard by low farm milk prices that have resulted in sharply reduced incomes, which is placing our nation\u2019s dairy industry in an extremely vulnerable position. A number of factors have contributed to this crisis. U.S. milk production has increased almost two percent above last year\u2019s level, while global milk production is up significantly, partly as a result of the European Union\u2019s decision to remove its milk production quotas and the loss of their export market to Russia. Furthermore, we are seeing an increase in production in other major milk-producing countries that have led to these depressed prices globally. All of this comes as our dairy farmers are still adjusting to the new Farm Bill, and the many changes that were made to our dairy support programs. We are deeply concerned that U.S. dairy farmers, who are a key part of our agriculture community and agriculture economy, are in greater need of stability and support as they face these significantly lower prices, which for many are below their actual cost of production. As this industry is reeling from low prices, a glut of imports, challenges in our export markets, and poor economic growth projections we urge the USDA to use its secretarial authority under the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714c), Section 32 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1935 (7 U.S.C. 612c), and look to past precedent for how to take action to protect all of our nation\u2019s dairy farmers from further crisis and to aid in the expansion and maintenance of domestic markets. We encourage USDA to take any and all actions available in order to make an immediate market injection and offer financial assistance that will directly support U.S. dairy farmers equally, while being cautious to not stimulate overproduction further. The family business of dairy farming has long been woven into our nation\u2019s agricultural history. Across the country, in all 50 states, dairy farms large and small are economic drivers providing local jobs and local products. During the 2009 dairy collapse, we saw far too many families have to sell off their cows and close the doors for good. Through the support of USDA, we can hopefully prevent many farms from needing to make that same difficult decision today and we hope you will work to support all of our dairy farmers across the country. We look forward to working closely with you in determining the best course of action to take in managing the current dairy industry financial crisis. Thank you for taking the time to address this important matter."},

{"title": " Collins Leads Bipartisan Senators, including King, in urging CMS to Exapnd Substance Abuse Treatment Coverage ", "date": ["Posted Thu, 08/11/2016 - 16:13"], "release": " \u2013 U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Dick Durbin (D-IL) today led a bipartisan group of 29 senators, including Senator Angus King, in urging the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to improve access to substance abuse treatment by modifying the Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) Exclusion.\u00a0 The IMD Exclusion currently limits options for individuals seeking substance abuse treatment by prohibiting federal reimbursement for services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries between ages 22 and 64 in certain settings, including residential mental health and substance use disorder treatment facilities with over 16 beds.\u00a0 \u00a0In a letter to CMS Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt, the senators asked the agency to use existing authorities to provide greater flexibility in order to ensure patient access to medically necessary substance abuse treatment. The letter was also signed by Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Rob Portman (R-OH), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Mark Kirk (R-IL), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Bob Casey (D-PA), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Diane Feinstein (D-CA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Al Franken (D-MN), and Cory Booker (D-NJ). The Honorable Andy Slavitt Acting Administrator Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 7500 Security Boulevard Baltimore, MD 21244 Dear Administrator Slavitt: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In December 2014, 18 bipartisan Senators wrote to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regarding the Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) Exclusion, which prohibits federal financial participation (FFP) for services furnished in an IMD setting to adults age 22-64 years. This existing policy limits treatment for those who need it most, is clinically inappropriate for proper care, and is rooted in an outdated definition of mental health. In light of the ongoing heroin and prescription opioid epidemic that is impacting communities across the nation, we urge CMS to take additional steps, utilizing existing authorities, to provide greater flexibility in ensuring patient access to medically necessary evidence-based substance abuse treatment. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Over the past two decades, CMS has taken important strides to expand eligibility, protect benefits, and improve provider capacity for the coverage of substance use disorder (SUD) services in Medicaid. The emergence of coordinated and integrated service delivery models that include behavioral health care services in Medicaid have improved outcomes and reduced costs. We also applaud CMS for its leadership in identifying innovative approaches to expand access to SUD treatment, through recent measures including the July 2015 1115 waiver guidance letter, the focus of the Innovation Accelerator Program on SUD treatment, the March 2016 mental health and SUD parity final rule, and the April 2016 Medicaid managed care final rule. Specifically, we commend CMS on the acknowledgement that the IMD Exclusion poses a barrier to beneficiary access to SUD treatment, and for incorporating new tools to mitigate the effect of this policy. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 However, we remain concerned that these measures may be insufficient to respond to the opioid epidemic and will not afford enough states the opportunity to enact meaningful changes for beneficiaries. For example, only one state has received approval from CMS for an 1115 waiver for SUD treatment overhauls, whereas many states have indicated an inability to marshal the resources to undertake such a broad, budget-neutral proposal. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Furthermore, the recent managed care rule only allows for 15 days of care furnished in an IMD setting over a 30-day period to be eligible for FFP, and it is our understanding that only American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Level 4 facilities are eligible. We have serious concerns about limiting eligibility to medically managed intensive inpatient care settings, while precluding all types of Level 3 residential treatment facilities when such settings may be more clinically appropriate.\u00a0 Further, we question whether a 15-day length of stay is evidence-based for SUD treatment, considering numerous studies suggesting the cost-savings, readmissions reductions, overdose preventions, and recovery efficacy from longer lengths of stay in residential settings as a patient progresses down the clinical continuum of care. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 CMS\u2019 recent mental health and SUD parity final rule extends certain protections from the Wellstone-Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 to Medicaid managed care organizations. CMS noted in its fact sheet that this final rule \u201chelps to prevent inequity between beneficiaries who have mental health or substance use disorder conditions in the commercial market and Medicaid.\u201d We seek clarification from CMS on whether the IMD Exclusion can be justified given these parity laws and regulations, especially considering the fact that Medicaid beneficiaries are not covered for medically necessary treatment within settings that play an important role within the continuum of care. Such an exclusion appears to be discriminatory to the estimated 12 percent of adult Medicaid beneficiaries ages 18-64 who have SUDs. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our nation is in the midst of a heroin and prescription opioid epidemic that has shined a spotlight on barriers to patient access to life-saving care.\u00a0 Improved understanding of addiction pathologies has also informed novel therapies, and patients with SUDs can now manage addiction and reach recovery using medication-assisted treatments.\u00a0 There are numerous Congressional efforts underway seeking to address this issue, but we strongly urge CMS to use existing authorities to broaden treatment opportunities, such as by removing SUD treatment and facilities from the IMD Exclusion. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We look forward to your timely response. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sincerely,"},

This legislation would expand and improve access to training and support services for families and caregivers of those living with the disease,\u201d   \u201cCaring for individuals living with Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias is both emotionally and financially straining. This important legislation would help to alleviate some of the financial burden, and importantly allow for family caregivers to receive the training and support necessary to provide quality care for their loved ones.\u201d \u201cUntil we find a cure, we have to make sure that there is access to quality care,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cBy providing resources and grants to expand training and support services for families and caregivers of people living with dementia, The Alzheimer\u2019s Caregiver Support Act helps ensure better outcomes for both individuals with dementia and their family caregivers, and helps lower overall \u00a0care costs.\u00a0 The Alzheimer\u2019s Foundation of America commends Senators Klobuchar and Collins for their introduction of this important legislation and looks forward to working with them and our other champions in Congress to get this bill passed into law.\u201d Earlier this year, Senators Collins and Klobuchar urged the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to work to implement a program that fully evaluates how providing Alzheimer\u2019s disease support services to caregivers would impact Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s. Senators Collins and Klobuchar also led a letter calling on President Obama to increase our nation\u2019s funding for Alzheimer\u2019s research as part of his fiscal year 2017 budget request. In addition, they introduced a Senate resolution declaring that the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025 is an \"urgent national priority.\""},

{"title": "Following Senator Collins\u2019 Advocacy, Mainer Victimized by Drug Smuggling Scam Released from Spanish Prison", "date": ["Posted Wed, 06/22/2016 - 17:02"], "release": "One week ago, J. Bryon Martin, a 77-year-old former pastor from Dresden, Maine, was serving the first year of a six-year sentence in a Spanish prison.\u00a0 With failing health, Mr. Martin faced the prospect of spending the rest of his life incarcerated, thousands of miles from his home and loved ones.\u00a0 His crime?\u00a0 Mr. Martin was the victim of a scam that tricked him into unknowingly transporting illegal drugs across an international border. The scam that ensnared Mr. Martin was one of the worst scams I have uncovered through my work as Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee.\u00a0 Mr. Martin\u2019s heartbreaking case was the subject of a February hearing on drug cartels that deceive unsuspecting seniors into smuggling illicit substances across international borders.\u00a0 The scam is particularly pernicious as it preys upon the trusting nature of seniors as well as the loneliness some experience later in life.\u00a0 It begins when a criminal organization draws an unsuspecting senior into a web of deceit by first forming a personal online relationship.\u00a0 The criminals then trick the senior into traveling overseas under a pretense, such as collecting money that has been won in a \u201clottery,\u201d recovering important documents, or meeting their online \u201cfriend.\u201d\u00a0 The criminals cover the cost of international travel for their victim and often create a complicated itinerary that requires the senior to travel to at least one other country and pick up a package or suitcase en route. Unbeknownst to the senior, these packages have drugs hidden inside. Mr. Martin developed an online friendship with an individual he believed was named \u201cJoy\u201d but who was actually a scammer.\u00a0 \u201cJoy\u201d asked Mr. Martin to travel to South America, pick up some sealed packages she claimed contained real estate documents, and deliver them to her in Europe.\u00a0 Mr. Martin was unaware that the sealed packages actually contained approximately four pounds of cocaine.\u00a0 The contraband was discovered by authorities during a stopover in Madrid, and the unsuspecting courier, Mr. Martin, was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to six years in a Spanish prison. Fortunately, Mr. Martin\u2019s tragic story had a happy ending.\u00a0 After learning about Mr. Martin\u2019s incarceration, my staff and I worked tirelessly to raise his case to the appropriate authorities and help facilitate his release.\u00a0 In March, I was joined by the Ranking Member and several members of the Committee in writing a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, urging him to work with foreign governments to reexamine the cases of scam victims like Mr. Martin.\u00a0 In addition, my office called the U.S. Embassy in Spain and the State Department every single week, pushing them to intervene to secure Mr. Martin\u2019s early release on humanitarian grounds. As a result of our advocacy, the Spanish government granted Mr. Martin a humanitarian release on June 13, and he has been reunited with his family.\u00a0 I was delighted to have the opportunity to call Mr. Martin and welcome him home.\u00a0 I so am pleased that Mr. Martin is back in the United States where he belongs and appreciate the efforts made by Secretary of State Kerry and James Costos, the United States Ambassador to Spain. This welcome result, however, does not diminish the seriousness of this particularly cruel and growing scam.\u00a0 It is estimated that at least 145 Americans have been arrested overseas after becoming ensnared by these smuggling operations and that some 30 remain in foreign custody. This scam, as bizarre and convoluted as it seems, is increasingly common.\u00a0 At our February hearing, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol officials described a new joint operation dubbed \u201cOperation Cocoon\u201d between U.S. and international law enforcement agencies to combat this scam.\u00a0 So far, Operation Cocoon has prevented at least 16 seniors from becoming victims and foreign authorities have arrested 15 subjects affiliated with international criminal organizations. The criminals, global drug traffickers, who set this chain of events into motion are cruel, but also very, very clever.\u00a0 Federal law enforcement needs to continue a vigorous and determined effort, which is not an easy task given the challenges posed by international boundaries. In addition, it is essential that seniors and their families become aware of these criminals\u2019 techniques and take action to protect themselves and their loved ones from these heartless criminals.\u00a0 The offer of free airline tickets should be a red flag, and all travelers should refuse requests to convey packages or luggage on behalf of someone they do not know.\u00a0\u00a0 It is wonderful that Mr. Martin is back home, safe and sound, but it is also outrageous that the individuals who perpetrate these crimes against seniors like Mr. Martin remain free, likely targeting more unsuspecting people, while the victims languish in foreign prisons, thousands of miles from their families.\u00a0 I will continue to work to ensure that law enforcement has the tools it needs to pursue these criminals and to raise awareness so that fewer seniors fall victim to this scam."},

Instead, the goal is to have as good a life as possible all the way to the very end,\u201d was the message Dr. Atul Gawande, surgeon and author of the   best-selling book, \u201cBeing Mortal,\u201d delivered today in testimony to the Senate Special Committee on Aging. The hearing, titled   explored ways to improve the quality and availability of care and examined models of care that are helping people with serious illness and their families. Today, approximately 90 million Americans, more than one in four, lives with a serious illness. These numbers will increase as the population ages. As Dr. Gawande noted in his testimony, \u201cpeople with serious, potentially life-limiting illnesses face substantial and increasing suffering, particularly during the last year of life. Medical care today typically exacerbates this suffering, often without any benefit of lengthened life. We have an opportunity to change this.\u201d U.S. Senator Susan Collins, Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, conveyed the importance of advance care planning conversations to a patients\u2019 physical, emotional, social and spiritual well-being. However, studies reveal that less than one-third of physicians have reported that their practice or health care system has a formal program in place to assess patients\u2019 goals or preferences. \u201cToday\u2019s hearing featured powerful testimony about the need for families and health care providers to prioritize these important life conversations, so that individuals\u2019 wishes are known and person-centered care is prioritized,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cFederal policies must then support efforts to relieve suffering, respect personal choice, provide opportunities for people to find meaning and comfort during serious illness, and \u2013 most important \u2013 remain in control of their own care.\u201d Collins also told the story of a personal friend who benefited from the person-centered care she received while she was a patient at the Gosnell Memorial Hospice House in Scarborough, Maine. \u201cDespite her serious illness, because of hospice care her days were filled with visits from friends and families and many joyful moments, and she was surrounded by her family when she died peacefully,\u201d she said. Some of the most powerful testimony came from Amy Berman, a nurse and senior program officer at the John A. Hartford Foundation, who is living with stage IV inflammatory breast cancer and espoused the importance of palliative care, which is designed to improve the quality of life for patients with serious illness. \u201cPalliative care is the best friend of the seriously ill,\u201d said Berman, \u201cStudies have shown that when palliative care is added at the beginning of a serious illness that people feel better and live longer.\u201d In medium and large hospitals with more than 50 beds, the number with palliative care teams more than doubled in the last fifteen years, increasing from 658 hospitals in 2000 to 1,700 hospitals in 2015.\u00a0 Moreover, hospice participation has nearly doubled in the last fifteen years, with more than 1.3 million Medicare beneficiaries electing hospice services in 2014, compared to 650,000 in 2000. More than one quarter of beneficiaries, however, enroll in hospice in their last week of life, which raises concerns about quality of care for beneficiaries who only receive hospice care for a short period of time.\u00a0 It also raises questions about how current federal policies affect patients\u2019 use of palliative and hospice care. Dr. Kate Lally, Chief of palliative care for Care New England Health System in Providence, Rhode Island, urged Congress to consider legislation that would improve the quality, not just the quantity, of life of the seriously ill. \u201cI feel blessed to do this work, and to be able to reflect with my patients on the life they have lived, their joys and regrets,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel I am able to share some of the most sacred moments of their life, and be at their side as they consider what is most important to them in their limited time.\u201d"},

{"title": "ICYMI: \u201cSen. Susan Collins, armed for compromise on guns\u201d", "date": ["Posted Fri, 06/24/2016 - 10:48"], "release": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Every senator knew that the four gun-control measures brought up post-Orlando were going down in a partisan duel on the Senate floor on Monday. So Susan Collins, the moderate Republican from Maine, came armed for compromise. There she stood in her pale yellow suit, easily visible and strategically positioned near a door where Republicans enter the chamber \u2013 but also not too far from the Democratic side. As the defeats piled up, she chatted with senators from both parties, handing them a one-page summary of an alternative measure from her folder. This is classic Collins, working her colleagues with calm persuasion, facts, and analysis, looking for common ground on one of the country\u2019s most contentious issues. She is, say senators on both sides, a highly respected bridge-builder at a time when Washington is at a defining moment on divisive gun politics. \u201cOne of the very best,\u201d says Sen. Lamar Alexander (R) of Tennessee. \u201cThe main thing Susan Collins does is ... her homework, so when she\u2019s talking for example about what to do about terrorists with guns, she\u2019s usually the best informed senator in the room and everyone listens to her,\u201d he says. \u201cThat helps her when she\u2019s working across the aisle, and that helps her when she\u2019s working in our caucus.\u201d On Thursday, Senator Collins saw what she had achieved. In the face of a procedural effort to kill her \"no-fly, no-buy\" compromise, all Democrats present in the chamber, plus eight Republicans and an independent, voted to keep it alive. That's a bipartisan majority of 52 senators who supported her effort to prevent suspected terrorists from buying guns. But it fell eight votes short of the 60 it would need to go any further. That may well have been only six votes short, had Bernie Sanders (I) of Vermont and Dianne Feinstein (D) of California been present. It also did not help her cause that a last-minute alternative offered by Sen. Ron Johnson (R) of Wisconsin, may well have siphoned votes away from her compromise. His effort was roundly defeated. If any gun measure had a chance in Congress, it was the Collins compromise, which prevents individuals on the \u201cno fly\u201d list and a related narrow list from buying firearms in a gun store. It alerts the FBI if anyone who has been in a much broader database over the past five years purchases a gun \u2013 a provision that would have pinged authorities in the case of the Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen. Despite the lack of a current path forward, Collins still called Thursday's vote \u201ca good sign.\u201d Talking with reporters afterward, she said that \u201cthis is the first time in a very long time that there has been a significant bipartisan vote on an issue that would limit access to guns to those who are on terrorist watch lists.\u201d She was also encouraged by moderate Republicans who have expressed an interest in introducing companion legislation in the House. That\u2019s another \u201creal sign of progress,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are eager to come up with a bipartisan approach to a real problem that does not compromise Second Amendment rights.\u201d On the other hand, she told reporters earlier that the 25-hour sit-in by House Democrats demanding a vote on gun legislation was not helpful because it ginned up partisanship. The senior senator from Maine ranks as the most bipartisan member of the Senate, according to an index by the Lugar Center and George Washington University. She certainly earned that ranking in this latest effort. The compromise is more narrowly targeted than Senate Democrats wanted, covering 109,000 people worldwide but only 2,700 Americans or legal residents. Still, she won over Democrats, who viewed it as a step in the right direction, and as leverage to move on to expanded background checks. Collins had a much harder sell in her own party. The measure\u2019s process of appeal for individuals who may be wrongly on the lists was not judged robust enough for many Republicans. The powerful National Rifle Association came out against it as an unconstitutional denial of Second Amendment rights. On Thursday, 46 Republicans voted to kill the legislation. When addressing such criticisms, Collins simply echoes the majority view of Americans. \u201cThis is common sense. It does not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of Americans. All it does is say, that if you\u2019re too dangerous to board an airplane, you\u2019re too dangerous to buy a gun,\u201d Collins said on the floor just before Thursday\u2019s procedural vote. It\u2019s a position that even hawkish Lindsey Graham (R) of South Carolina, one of 11 co-sponsors of the Collins compromise, can embrace \u2013 along with his AR-15 rifle. To the NRA, he said at a press conference on Tuesday, \u201cevery right, whether speech or buying a weapon, or any other constitutional right, has boundaries on it.\u201d The compromise, he added, \u201cmakes sense to me.\u201d Collins and the junior senator from Maine, independent Angus King, who also co-sponsored the legislation, practice a pragmatism that caused a Democratic colleague to ask Sen. King: \u201cIs there something in the water in Maine that gives people common sense?\u201d The answer lies not in the water, but in a political tradition that has had a significant influence on Collins. She grew up in the town of Caribou, in the northeastern tip of Maine, not far from the Canadian border. Her family runs a lumber business founded by her ancestors in 1844, and five generations on her father\u2019s side served in the state legislature. Her father, too, was in the state senate and both of her parents served as mayor of Caribou. \u201cThere\u2019s a tradition and history of independence\u201d among Maine\u2019s senators in Washington, and Collins and Senator King \u2013 a former governor \u2013 reflect that, says former Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe, a moderate Mainer who left the Senate in 2013 because of the hyper-partisanship and dysfunction. \u201cWe\u2019re a very practical people.\u201d Senator Snowe lists her independent-minded predecessors: Democrat George Mitchell, who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland; Sen. William Cohen, who as a House member, became one of the first Republicans to break ranks and demand the impeachment of President Nixon during the Watergate crisis (Collins was interning for him at the time and went on to work for him); Democrat Ed Muskie, former governor, senator, and secretary of State. But it was Republican Margaret Chase Smith, the first woman to serve in both the US House and Senate \u2013 and to represent Maine on Capitol Hill \u2013 who set Collins on her journey to the Senate. Collins was just 18 years old, a senior at Caribou High School, when she had the opportunity to meet Smith in her private Washington office as part of a youth Senate program. \u201cI arrived at Senator Smith\u2019s office a bit breathless about meeting her,\u201d Collins recounts in a book about Senate women, \u201cNine and Counting,\u201d published in 2000 (20 women currently serve in the Senate). To the student\u2019s great surprise, Smith spent nearly two hours with her, answering Collins\u2019s many questions. \u201cBut what I most remember, was her urging me always to stand tall for what I believed in.\u201d Smith described to Collins her famous \u201cDeclaration of Conscience\u201d speech, in which she denounced McCarthyism on the Senate floor. \u201cI remember being so proud that Margaret Chase Smith was my senator,\u201d recalled Collins, who hung a signed copy of Smith\u2019s creed of public service in her personal office when she became a senator herself. An independent streak runs through Collins, too. While she often votes with her party on national security and sometimes on fiscal issues, she has parted ways on gay rights, campaign-finance reform, and man-made climate change, among many other issues. The NRA graded her at C+ in 2012. Similarly, the anti-tax group Club for Growth gave her a 37 percent lifetime score in 2013 \u2013 the lowest of any Republican senator. Yet in 2014, she soared to reelection for a fourth term, her constituents rewarding a conscientious legislator who last year cast her 6,000th consecutive vote. \u201cI admire that she\u2019s not afraid to buck either party, and put the American people first to get things done,\u201d says Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) of New Hampshire, a former state attorney general who played a key role in writing the due process part of Collins compromise. It\u2019s that independence that gives Collins the leverage to make deals and pass legislation \u2013 along with her legendary command of the facts and her gracious yet forthright manner. In the Senate, where anything of major importance requires 60 votes to pass, Collins, with the help of just a few others, can sometimes tip things one way or the other. In 2009, Collins was one of only three Republicans to vote for the stimulus package to rescue an economy in free fall. She wanted for Maine the jobs the package promised, but she and her colleagues \u2013 including Senator Snowe \u2013 were not happy with the price tag, which at one point neared $900 billion. It got whittled down to $787 billion. In 2004, she worked with Joe Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat-turned-independent, to reorganize American intelligence after 9/11, creating a new counterterrorism center and the office of the director of national intelligence. On the other hand, when President Obama came courting her to support the Affordable Care Act, she gave him the cold shoulder. She\u2019s no fan of \u201cObamacare,\u201d and bristled at his overture to a few Republicans for a bill written largely by Democrats. Still, when GOP resistance to the healthcare law plunged the country into a partial government shutdown in October 2013, she tried to find a bipartisan way out. It didn\u2019t succeed, but it helped pave the way for an agreement that soon ended the crisis. On the gun compromise, Richard Durbin (D) of Illinois, the Senate minority whip, backed the legislation. \u201cWhat is driving this more than anything is our respect for Susan Collins,\u201d said Sen. Durbin, who worked with the Mainer on the effort. \u201cThe default mechanism is to give her a chance,\u201d said Durbin on Tuesday. The senator is responsible for rounding up Democratic votes. Collins vows to keep working on this issue. \u201cI never give up,\u201d she said after coming off the Senate floor. The shortfall shows a Congress in need of more people like Collins, often described as one of the last Republican moderates on the Hill, says former Republican Sen. Richard Lugar, a storied bridge-builder himself. \u201cI hope [she\u2019s] not a dying breed,\u201d says the senator, who lost in the primaries to a tea party candidate in 2012. The reason his center and Georgetown University came up with their Bipartisan Index was to reverse \u201cthe very disturbing trend\u201d of partisanship. Senator Lugar says the index is having some effect as members of Congress, responding to articles in their hometown papers, approach him on how to improve their rankings. The answer is simple, he says. Offer legislation with bipartisan co-sponsors, or try to co-sponsor legislation from the other party. The current gun debate is a case in point. \u201cOnce again, this illustrates the importance of a leader like Susan Collins, who wasn\u2019t willing to leave it\u201d at 0-4 on an issue of American safety, he says. \u201cThis may not meet everybody\u2019s measure, but the need to show responsiveness of our legislative body, to be active at a time of national peril, is very, very important.\u201d"},

GAO recommends that IRS conduct an updated risk assessment to identify new or ongoing risks for TPP\u2019s online and phone authentication options. Currently, IRS remotely verifies taxpayers\u2019 identities using single-factor authentication procedures. Due to the wide availability of personal information available online, criminals are often able to find or purchase enough personal information to pass these authentication quizzes. According to GAO, once IRS updates TPP\u2019s risk assessment, the agency can then select the appropriate authentication technology needed to strengthen TPP authentication. IRS could implement a multi-factor authentication standard that would require filers to provide proof of \u201csomething they have\u201d in addition to questions about \u201cwhat they know.\u201d Strengthening TPP could help IRS prevent criminals from stealing billions of dollars in tax refunds.

The goal of the EDAT will be to leverage the power of multiple federal government agencies and harness stakeholder input to create economic development strategies that help pave the way for job growth in rural Maine communities in the years to come. Maine\u2019s Congressional delegation was informed of the decision in identical individual letters today from Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker. Senators King and Collins originally requested the formation of the EDAT in   letter to Secretary Pritzker. In the letter, Secretary Pritzker announced that Commerce Department intends to deploy an EDAT on the ground in northern Maine for three days in July \u2013 the exact dates are to be determined \u2013 to \u201cparticipate in a comprehensive set of stakeholder meetings to evaluate new and existing economic strategies for addressing the state\u2019s forest-based economic challenges.\u201d Secretary Pritzker also wrote that the EDAT will be modeled off the National Disaster Framework and will be similar to those that the Economic Development Administration has used to address more than 30 prior major incidents and other economic development crises, such as the New England fisheries challenges, Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Joplin\u2019s EF-5 tornado, and Colorado wildfires and flooding. The EDAT will leverage resources from multiple federal agencies including the Economic Development Administration, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Treasury, the Small Business Administration, and the Northern Border Regional Commission. The following text was sent in individual, identical letters to Senators King and Collins and Representatives Poliquin and Pingree today: +++ June 29, 2016 Following up from my previous letter on March 28, 2016, I am writing today to outline the Department of Commerce's response to the economic challenges occurring in Maine's forest-based economy. As I mentioned before, I have tasked the Economic Development Administration (EDA) with leading our response. Since March, EDA has taken steps to coordinate and prepare a multi-agency response to the region's economic challenges. EDA has worked diligently with your offices and regional stakeholders to encourage a community-led process capable of driving economic growth throughout Maine. At the invitation of representatives from your state, we are excited to announce that an Economic Development Assessment Team (EDA T) will deploy to northern Maine next month and participate in a comprehensive set of stakeholder meetings to evaluate new and existing economic strategies for addressing the state's forest-based economic challenges. Over the course of three days, regional leaders, alongside the Federal partners, will have the opportunity to engage in an intensive set of economic development sessions, tours, and briefings in an effort to identify pathways of economic diversification and related Federal resources available to help develop those pathways. In particular, this process will also examine how local, state, and Federal partners can work together on new and existing research to foster future innovation and commercialization in the forest economy. Modeled after the National Disaster Recovery Framework, this EDAT deployment will be similar to those EDA has used to address more than 30 prior major incidents and other economic development crises, including the New England fisheries challenges, Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Joplin's EF-5 tornado, and Colorado wildfires and flooding. The Department and EDA believe that success in addressing this issue will depend upon a coordinated multi-agency effort and the dedication of significant public and private financial resources over an extended period of time. Furthermore, effectively addressing this issue will require the strong commitment and engagement of local, regional, and state leaders in Maine. To that point, in addition to EDA, regional community representatives will meet with EDAT members from across the Federal Government, including the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Treasury, the Small Business Administration, and the Northern Border Regional Commission, along with invited economic development experts. At the conclusion of the EDAT process, regional and local stakeholders will have a bottom-up strategy, developed with input from their Federal partners, designed to foster robust economic growth and recovery. EDATs are not designed to be a silver bullet, but EDA and its Federal partners are committed to working closely with you and the Maine stakeholders in the years to come to help struggling communities statewide work toward building a robust and enduring economy. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sincerely, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Penny Pritzker"},

The callers frequently threaten victims with arrest, foreclosure, or other adverse legal action.\u00a0 Scammers often instruct their victims to pay using a money wire or prepaid debit card.\u00a0 In the past several weeks, however, the Inspector General, has learned that IRS impersonation scammers increasingly are demanding payment in the form of iTunes or other gift cards.\u00a0 Once these con artists have the numbers on the back of the activated gift cards, they can either use the cards for purchases or resell the cards to third parties online.\u00a0 A recent   article detailed how a resident of Kennebec County   through a similar impersonation scam. \u201cThis most recent variation of the IRS impersonation scam demonstrates that these fraudsters are relentless in their desire to rob our nation\u2019s seniors of their hard-earned savings,\u201d    . \u00a0\u201cPutting a stop to such aggressive and ruthless scams is among my highest priorities as Chairman of the Aging Committee.\u00a0 Hundreds of seniors in Maine and across the country have contacted the Committee\u2019s Fraud Hotline to report that they have received these calls.\u201d With such scams reaching epidemic proportions across the country, the IRS has released several tips to help taxpayers identify suspicious calls that may be part of a scam: Last year, Senator Collins   at which the Inspector General testified that this scam was \u201cthe largest, most pervasive impersonation scam in the history of the IRS.\u201d\u00a0 Senator Collins advises seniors to simply hang up the phone if they receive an unexpected call from someone claiming to be from the IRS.\u00a0 In addition, complaints can be made to TIGTA (1-800-366-4484), the FTC (1-877-382-4357), or to the Senate Aging Committee\u2019s Fraud Hotline (1-855-303-9470).

{"title": "The Right Care at the Right Time", "date": ["Posted Fri, 07/01/2016 - 10:55"], "release": "\u201cThe goal is not a good death. Instead, the goal is to have as good a life as possible all the way to the very end.\u201d \u00a0 That was the message Dr. Atul Gawande, surgeon and author of the   best-selling book,  delivered at a recent Senate Aging Committee hearing that I chaired. Our hearing explored ways to not only expand, but also to improve, the care provided to the approximately 90 million Americans who are living with a serious, often life threatening, illness. Advance care planning conversations are critical to the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual well-being of any individual living with a serious illness.\u00a0 These important life conversations among the patient, the family, and the health care provider help to ensure that an individual\u2019s wishes are known and that the care they are receiving is consistent with the care they want. Dr. Gawande noted during the hearing that people with serious, potentially life-limiting illnesses may face substantial suffering, particularly during the last year of life. As he said, \u201cMedical care today typically exacerbates this suffering, often without any benefit of lengthened life. We have an opportunity to change this.\u201d That point was underscored by another of our witnesses, Amy Berman, a nurse and senior program officer at the John A. Hartford Foundation, a national health care foundation focused on improving the care of older adults.\u00a0 Ms. Berman is living with stage IV inflammatory breast cancer. In her powerful testimony, Ms. Berman discussed her experience and emphasized the importance of palliative care, calling it \u201cthe best friend of the seriously ill\u201d that helps \u201cpeople feel better and live longer.\u201d\u00a0 Palliative care focuses on addressing the pain and stress of a serious illness and improving the quality of life for both the patient and the family. When she was first diagnosed, Ms. Berman was fortunate to meet with an oncologist who asked her an important, but too often uncommon, question: What did she hope for?\u00a0 In response, Ms. Berman told her doctor that she wanted to hold onto the life she had, maximizing her good days and avoid aggressive treatment that would decrease the quality of those days. Her doctor understood her desire to live the life she had left to the fullest and designed a personalized care plan consistent with her wishes, which excluded debilitating, aggressive treatments and surgeries that offered no hope for a cure. When Ms. Berman received her diagnosis, it was highly unlikely that she would survive five years; yet, here she was testifying before our Committee a full five and a half years later! \u00a0As a result of palliative care, she is able to work full time, travel, and enjoy her family and friends despite her illness. I, too, have seen the benefits of care planning.\u00a0 A few years ago, one of my dear friends was a patient at the Gosnell Memorial Hospice House in Scarborough. Despite her serious illness, her remaining days were filled with visits from friends and family, and many joyful moments.\u00a0 She died peacefully, surrounded by her family just as she had wanted. As Ms. Berman noted in her testimony, however, this type of person-centered care is unfortunately the exception. While a majority of Americans say that they would prefer to die at home, most people still die in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, studies reveal that less than one-third of physicians report that their practice or health care system has a formal program for assessing patients\u2019 goals or preferences. We must work to ensure that our federal policies support efforts to relieve suffering, respect personal choice, and provide opportunities for people to find meaning and comfort during serious illness, and \u2013 most important \u2013 remain in control of their own care. Dr. Gawande truly put it best when he said that the most effective and important way to learn about an individual\u2019s priorities is to ask the individual directly.\u00a0 It is essential for families and health care providers to have these important conversations so that individuals\u2019 wishes are known and reflected in their treatment, and that family members can rest assured knowing that their loved one is receiving the care they want."},

It is, therefore, imperative that we give our family caregivers the support that they need to provide high quality care.\u201d The Alzheimer\u2019s Caregiver Support Act would authorize grants to public and non-profit organizations to expand training and support services that improve caregiver health and delay long-term care admissions by keeping patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias in their homes longer.\u00a0 The bill is supported by UsAgainstAlzheimer\u2019s, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, and the Alzheimer\u2019s Foundation of America. Approximately 5.4 million Americans are living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease today, including 37,000 in Maine, and that number is soaring as our overall population grows older and lives longer.\u00a0 According to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, 15.9 million unpaid caregivers provided 18.1 billion hours of care valued at more than $221 billion in 2015.\u00a0 These caregivers provide tremendous value, but they also face many challenges.\u00a0 Many are employed and struggle to balance their work and caregiving responsibilities.\u00a0 They may also be putting their own health at risk, since caregivers experience high levels of stress and have a greater incidence of chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, and depression.\u00a0 Last year, caregivers of people living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or related dementias shouldered $10.2 billion in health care costs related to the physical and emotional effects of caregiving.

In this scam, fraudsters telephone victims, impersonate an IRS agent, and demand payment for allegedly unpaid taxes. The callers frequently threaten victims with arrest, foreclosure, or other adverse legal action.\u00a0 Scammers often instruct their victims to pay using a money wire or prepaid debit card.\u00a0 In the past several weeks, however, the U.S. Treasury Department has learned that IRS impersonation scammers increasingly are demanding payment in the form of iTunes or other gift cards.\u00a0 Once these con artists have the numbers on the back of the activated gift cards, they can either use the cards for purchases or resell the cards to third parties online.\u00a0 A resident of Kennebec County recently lost $1,000 in iTunes gift cards through a similar scam. As Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I am focused on stopping fraud and financial exploitation against our seniors, who are the frequent targets of scammers.\u00a0 This problem is immense.\u00a0 America\u2019s seniors lose a staggering $2.9 billion each year to an ever-growing array of financial exploitation schemes and scams.\u00a0 With the wave of Baby Boomers now a \u201cSilver Tsunami\u201d of retirees, it is no mystery why financial fraud targeting seniors is considered \u201cThe Crime of the 21  Century.\u201d This most recent variation of the IRS impersonation scam demonstrates that these fraudsters are relentless in their desire to rob our nation\u2019s seniors of their hard-earned savings. Thousands of seniors in Maine and across the country have contacted our Committee\u2019s Fraud Hotline (toll-free at 1-855-303-9470)\u00a0to report that they have received calls and emails that are scams. In the Kennebec County case, a con artist impersonating a deputy sheriff called the victim and told her she would be arrested if she did not immediately pay $1,000 in iTunes gift cards for taxes she allegedly owed.\u00a0 The victim was told to buy the cards at a local store and to call back with the gift card numbers.\u00a0 The victim did as she was told, but when the impersonator demanded even more money, she realized she had been scammed and called the police. \u00a0By that time, it was too late. An investigator learned that the money had been transferred from the gift cards 25 minutes after they were activated. It is important for taxpayers of all ages to know that the IRS and Maine Revenue Services do not conduct business in this way.\u00a0 If either agency believes back taxes are owned, the taxpayer is notified in writing and there is a process for clarification, appeals, and for negotiating payment plans if taxes truly are owed.\u00a0 Threats of immediate arrest and demands for payment over the phone \u2013 whether by credit, debit, or gift card \u2013 are tell-tale signs of a scam. Last year, the Aging Committee\u2019s Fraud Hotline, which is staffed by experienced fraud investigators, received calls from more than 1,100 seniors across the country.\u00a0 The number-one complaint in 2015 was the IRS imposter scam.\u00a0 It is estimated that this scam has cost innocent victims more than $41 million, averaging more than $5,700 per victim. The Aging Committee\u2019s effort to fight senior fraud is bearing real results.\u00a0 In May, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration arrested five individuals in connection with the IRS imposter scam.\u00a0 Federal authorities believe these suspects scammed almost $2 million from more than 1,500 victims. The arrests stemmed from a call to the Committee\u2019s Fraud Hotline.\u00a0 The caller reported that her husband had recently been contacted by an individual claiming to be from the IRS and demanding immediate payment of alleged back taxes.\u00a0 The Fraud Hotline investigator who received the report was able to trace the $2,000 the victim wired via MoneyGram to Minnesota and reported this information to the Treasury Inspector General.\u00a0 The Inspector General\u2019s subsequent investigation led to the arrest of the five suspects.\u00a0 These actions should put criminals on notice that we will relentlessly pursue those who seek to rob seniors of their hard-earned savings. The Aging Committee\u2019s year-long campaign to combat the IRS impersonation scam has had encouraging successes.\u00a0 When we began our investigation, it was estimated that an IRS imposter reeled in one victim for every 60 threatening calls.\u00a0 Now, thanks to increased public awareness, it takes a con artist more than 400 calls to trick someone into falling for this scam.\u00a0 Still, far too many victims are losing their hard-earned money and, often, their retirement savings, to these criminals.\u00a0 The iTunes variation on the IRS impersonation scam underscores the point that, while law enforcement, consumer protection and aging agencies, and financial institutions have vital roles to play, alert citizens are our first and best line of defense.\u00a0 Like scams, being aware and informed is never out of season."},

This bill, along with other cybersecurity measures passed by Congress and under consideration before the Senate, can make a real contribution in strengthening our defenses against this dangerous threat.\u201d The United States is one of the most technologically-advanced countries in the world, which also means we\u2019re one of the most technologically-vulnerable countries in the world. In fact, right now there are hackers across the globe working to exploit weaknesses in the digital systems that help run critical infrastructure like our electric grid. And a successful attack could have catastrophic consequences,\u201d  . \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to act now \u2013 and by looking to the past, we may be able to develop ways to thwart the sophisticated cyber-attacks of the future. Our legislation would reengineer the last-mile of the energy grid to isolate its most important systems, and in doing so, help defend it from a devastating blow that could cut off electricity to millions of people across the country.\u201d \u201cProtecting our critical energy infrastructure systems is one of the most pressing security challenges facing the United States today,\u201d  . \u201cThe continual emergence of threats and vulnerabilities to digital systems has created significant weaknesses that require a large-scale, national effort to address, which is the intent of this legislation. The Idaho National Lab has the unique assets and expertise needed to drive the innovations this legislation aims to create and we are fortunate to have their leadership on this critical issue.\u201d \u201cCybersecurity is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation. The future of warfare is moving further away from the battlefield and closer to the devices and the networks everyday citizens depend on,\u201d  . \u201cProtecting our nation from malicious cyber actors requires a comprehensive approach, and keeping our energy infrastructure secure is central to that. I am especially proud that this legislation would rely on Sandia National Labs\u2019 expertise in providing technology solutions and developing a national strategy to isolate the energy grid from cyber attacks.\u201d Top officials within the Intelligence Community have testified that U.S. critical infrastructure are enticing targets to malicious actors. Those officials have also warned that, without action, the U.S. remains vulnerable to cyber-attacks that could result in catastrophic damage to public health and safety, economic security, and national security. This bill would examine ways to replace automated systems with manual procedures controlled by human operators to remove vulnerabilities that could allow cyber-criminals to access the grid through holes in digital software systems. This approach seeks to thwart even the most sophisticated cyber-adversaries who, if they are intent on accessing the grid, would have to actually physically touch the equipment, thereby making cyber-attacks much more difficult. The potential for this approach was evident in the December 2015 cyber-attack on Ukraine\u2019s power grid during which sophisticated cyber-attack techniques were used to plunge more than 225,000 people into darkness. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the cyber-attack was coordinated to target the Ukrainian power grid\u2019s industrial control systems, which act as the intermediary between computers and the switches that distribute electricity. The attack could have been worse if not for the fact that Ukraine relies on manual technology to operate its grid.

{"title": "Protecting Workers and Small Businesses from Misguided Federal Regulations", "date": ["Posted Tue, 06/07/2016 - 10:22"], "release": "Federal regulations can impose unexpected and costly requirements on small businesses, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations.\u00a0 A prime example is a new U.S. Department of Labor rule on overtime pay that could harm the very workers it intends to help, cause small businesses to curb hiring, and force universities and colleges to either raise tuition or cut programs. The new rule, scheduled to take effect this December, will double the current annual salary threshold from $23,660 to $47,476 for mandatory overtime. While it is time for a reasonable update in the threshold, doubling it will have negative consequences. \u00a0I have spoken with small businesses, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations across our state, and it is clear that this huge and sudden increase in the threshold is far too much and too fast.\u00a0 Rather than producing bigger paychecks, this new rule is likely to produce reduced hours, benefits, and flexibility for Maine workers. Many small employers in Maine have told me that they do not have the margins to pay overtime to salaried employees earning up to $47,476.\u00a0 Some will have to shift their employees to hourly jobs at rates that account for potential overtime.\u00a0 Formerly salaried employees used to flexibility in their work schedules will have to track closely each hour they work each week, instead of being able to leave work to pick up a child at school without worrying about the impact on their paycheck. Although the regulation is touted as a means of boosting employees\u2019 pay, a study commissioned by the National Retail Federation found that most employees would see no change in net pay.\u00a0Instead, many employees would see their hours reduced to avoid overtime, while others would see their base wages, benefits or bonus pay decreased in order the offset the added payroll expense. Moreover, the National Federation of Independent Business \u2013 a leading voice for small business \u2013 has noted that the new overtime rule would particularly hurt small businesses in rural areas. The Maine Department of Labor believes that the rule would have a disproportionate economic effect on Maine businesses, where salaries and the cost-of-living are not as high as in other regions of the country.\u00a0 For instance, the cost of living in Bangor is roughly 37 percent lower than in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 While $47,476 might seem like a reasonable threshold for an employee living in a high-cost area like Washington, D.C., it\u2019s the equivalent of a salary of more than $74,000 in Bangor.\u00a0 Some of Maine\u2019s businesses are highly seasonal.\u00a0 Workers understand that their salary involves extra work during the summer and fall months and a more relaxed schedule for the rest of the year.\u00a0 The new overtime rule would result in many workers being moved from salaried to hourly positions or even being let go during winter months.\u00a0 This will make it harder for workers to make ends meet and harder for employers to retain high-quality employees. Businesses are not alone in their concern.\u00a0 Non-profit organizations are also struggling with the impact on their workers and those whom they serve.\u00a0 The Executive Director for Habit for Humanity in Great Portland states that the \u201cnew overtime rules will so drastically change our current compensation obligations that we may no longer be able to give our workers the benefits, schedules and other incentives that drew them to us in the first place.\u201d \u00a0And he notes that \u201cservices to those in need will be reduced and organizational funding will decline as resources are spent on overhead instead of programs.\u201d Indeed, non-profit organizations would be among the hardest hit by this rule.\u00a0 Operation Smile, which provides vital oral surgeries around the world, estimates that the rule would cost the equivalent of more than 4,100 cleft-palate operations.\u00a0 Similar cutbacks in essential services are predicted by the Salvation Army, youth services providers, home health care services, and blood centers throughout the country. In addition, higher-education groups nationwide are urging the Department of Labor to take a more measured approach.\u00a0 The University of Maine system, which has worked so hard to freeze tuition and make higher education affordable, estimated that the new overtime rules could increase its costs by as much as $14 million. To prevent this rule from going into effect, I have joined a number of my colleagues in urging the Department of Labor to consider the negative impacts on small businesses and non-profits and reconsider its rule.\u00a0 In addition, I am a cosponsor of legislation that would nullify the current draft of the rule and would require the Department to take into account the effects of the rule on small businesses, differences in geographical regions, and impacts on lower-wage industries, startups, and workers.\u00a0 The\u00a0overtime threshold has not been increased in a number of years and should be raised, but doubling it will be extremely costly and damaging to small businesses, universities, nonprofit organizations, and so many other segments of our nation\u2019s economy and our society."},

This bipartisan legislation would provide health care professionals at all levels training on how to identify and appropriately treat human trafficking victims. \u201cSex trafficking is a heinous crime that tragically affects every corner of America.\u00a0 Human traffickers prey upon the most vulnerable, often homeless or runaway children,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cIdentification is a crucial, and frequently missed, step in helping victims and stopping these atrocities.\u00a0 This bipartisan legislation would expand a successful pilot program at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that more health care providers have the training to identify, report, and treat these cases, which will help us shine a light on some of the darkest stories imaginable and protect victims of these detestable crimes.\u201d \u201cVictims of human trafficking are hidden in plain sight \u2013 making those in captivity unrecognizable even to our most trusted professionals like doctors and nurses,\u201d   \u201cBy implementing across the country the successes of health worker pilot training programs in North Dakota, my bipartisan bill with Sen. Collins would help provide the critical tools medical professionals need to recognize and protect victims of human trafficking. Today\u2019s introduction of our bill in the U.S. House of Representatives is a critical step toward putting an end to human trafficking by identifying victims and getting them the support they need.\u201d \u201cHuman trafficking is a hidden crime that impacts hundreds of thousands of people across the U.S., and many of these victims end up in a health care setting while being exploited,\u201d   \u201cOur bill aims to ensure health care professionals are trained to identify victims of human trafficking and provide them with critical, victim-centered health care.\u00a0 Our bill also enables health care providers to implement protocols and procedures to work with victims, service organizations, and law enforcement so that victims can get proper support and perpetrators of human trafficking are brought to justice. I would like to thank Reps. Kinzinger, C\u00e1rdenas and Wagner for joining me in introducing this bill.\u201d \u201cIt is critical that our health care providers are trained to recognize cases of human trafficking and have the proper procedures to best help those most vulnerable,\u201d   \u201cI\u2019m proud to be an original cosponsor of the SOAR Act and I believe this pilot program will have a significant impact towards identifying cases of human trafficking and helping more victims across the country from this disgusting crime.\u201d \u201cHuman trafficking has grown into a large scale industry that is disproportionately geared towards women,\u201d   \u201cThis is just one of the many reasons why I did not hesitate to become an original cosponsor of the SOAR bill. Victims of trafficking suffer long-term effects, and with the introduction of new research, it is evident that the people who seek help can be identified and properly cared for by trained professionals.\u00a0It is time to use this information in order to help stop the growth of the trafficking industry and facilitate the well-being of both survivors and victims.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cEducation and awareness are critical in the fight to end human trafficking. This legislation will provide health care providers on all levels with the appropriate training and tools necessary to identify and report potential cases of human trafficking,\u201d   \u201cWith tens of thousands of victims being trafficked in the United States each year, I am happy to work with my colleagues across the aisle to introduce and quickly pass this legislation.\u201d\u00a0 The   supports efforts underway at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to combat human trafficking by directing the Secretary to establish a pilot program to be known as \u2018Stop, Observe, Ask and Respond to Health and Wellness Training.\u2019 While human trafficking victims are often difficult to identify, a reported 68 percent of trafficking victims end up in a health care setting at some point while being exploited, including in clinics, emergency rooms and doctor\u2019s offices.\u00a0 Despite this, out of more than 5,680 hospitals in the country, only 60 have been identified as having a plan for treating patients who are victims of trafficking and 95 percent of emergency room personnel are not trained to treat trafficking victims.

Bryon Martin, a 77-year-old former pastor from Dresden, Maine, who was incarcerated abroad after falling victim to an international drug smuggling scam, was released from a Spanish prison and has been reunited with his family in the United States.\u00a0 Yesterday afternoon, Senator Collins called Mr. Martin to welcome him home. Mr. Martin is one of at least 145 victims who have been arrested abroad for unknowingly carrying illegal narcotics across international borders after being deceived by global drug traffickers. This February,   that revealed this scam publicly for the first time. Prior to his release, Mr. Martin had been incarcerated in a Spanish prison since July 2015 serving out a six-year sentence. \u00a0Since learning about Mr. Martin\u2019s imprisonment earlier this year, Senator Collins has worked to secure his release.\u00a0 Chairman Collins and Ranking Member Claire McCaskill led seven other Committee members in  , urging him to work with foreign governments to reexamine the cases of incarcerated victims.\u00a0 \u201cIt is wonderful news that Mr. Martin has finally been released from prison and will be reunited with his family,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cThis was a truly tragic case, and I\u2019m delighted that my staff and I were able to raise Mr. Martin\u2019s case to the appropriate authorities and help facilitate his release.\u201d The Aging Committee\u2019s hearing examined how these cruel, but very clever criminals contact seniors and draw them into a web of deceit.

The bill funds programs that ensure our nation\u2019s continued presence and deterrence missions, including $3.2 billion for the procurement of two  -class destroyers as part of a multiyear procurement contract as well as incremental funding for a third fiscal year 2016 Flight III destroyer.\u00a0 This much-needed additional destroyer, which ranks number two on the Navy\u2019s Unfunded Priorities List, will be built at Bath Iron Works. \u00a0The bill also includes\u00a0$271 million to help complete the construction of the two DDG 1000 destroyers.\u00a0 These ships provide advanced capabilities, including stealth technology, electric propulsion, and a smaller crew size.\u00a0 The Navy recently accepted delivery of the first DDG 1000, the Zumwalt, a major milestone for this revolutionary program.\u00a0 \u201cGiven the ship\u2019s cutting-edge technology, unique hull, and advanced combat systems, the shipbuilders at Bath Iron Works should be commended for their exceptional work and dedication in building the largest and the most advanced Naval destroyer in history,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cAs the workhorses of the Navy, these destroyers help ensure that our Navy\u2019s capabilities remain unrivaled in delivering power and presence across the globe.\u00a0 From freedom of navigation missions in the South China Sea to addressing Iranian aggression in the Strait of Hormuz, these ships signal to enemies and allies alike that the U.S. Navy is ready to respond wherever and whenever it is needed.\u201d The FY 2017 NDAA also mandates that the Department of Defense comply with the Berry Amendment for athletic footwear issued to new recruits. The Berry Amendment, passed in 1941, requires the U.S. military to provide its personnel with American-made equipment and uniforms to the greatest extent possible.\u00a0 Despite this longstanding law, the DoD has refused to issue new recruits athletic footwear made in America by companies such as New Balance.\u00a0 The provision, introduced by Senator King, was based on   earlier this year. \u201cThe inclusion of this provision in the FY 2017 NDAA is welcome news for our military members and the nearly 1,000 Maine employees at New Balance. Senator King and I have long urged the Department of Defense to fully comply with the Berry Amendment and provide service men and women with the highest quality athletic shoes manufactured by U.S. companies like New Balance,\u201d  \u201cAs part of this effort, we introduced the Buy American Act earlier this year, and I applaud Senator King\u2019s diligent efforts as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\u201d Other provisions of the bill would provide $75 million for improvements at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, resources to assist allies and partners around the world, a 1.6 percent pay raise for service members, and additional protections for survivors of sexual assault."},

The resolution calls attention to the problem of elder abuse around the nation, and honors all those that fight for justice for victims. U.S. Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tom Cotton (R-AR), \u00a0Thom Tillis (R-NC), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Dean Heller (R-NV) cosponsored the resolution. \u201cAs the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, one of my top priorities is stopping abuse, fraud, and financial exploitation targeting our seniors,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cThis problem is immense, affecting millions of seniors every year. Unfortunately, however, many cases of elder abuse are never reported or discovered because the victim is too ashamed to report the abuse, particularly when it involves a family member. As a consequence, the true impact and incidence of this kind of abuse is still largely unknown. To help remedy this problem and increase awareness, organizations around the world and in the State of Maine have taken action and continue to work tirelessly to raise awareness of elder abuse and to protect the rights of aging adults.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cBy recognizing World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, this bipartisan measure raises awareness of the utterly unconscionable scourge of elder abuse in our society and honors the dedicated people who help protect our nation\u2019s elders from these shameless crimes,\u201d     \u201cIt is our duty to shed light on the horrendous situations in which criminals defraud our seniors of their hard-earned life savings, or in some cases even physically abuse them.

Financial abuse alone results in seniors\u2019 loss of $2.9 billion each year. This resolution recognizes survivors of elder abuse, and commends those who dedicate themselves to the prevention, response, and prosecution of abuse and exploitation of seniors. The resolution recognizes that public awareness has the potential to increase the identification and reporting of elder abuse by the public, professionals, and victims, and can act as a catalyst to promote issue-based education and long-term prevention; In addition to designating June 15, 2016, as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, the resolution:"},

In their letter,\u00a0 , \u201cGiven the significant adverse impact this rule would have on our nation\u2019s small investors, especially on those who reside in rural communities without broadband connectivity, allowing sufficient time for thoughtful review and commentary on the proposed rule is an appropriate precaution to ensure the SEC is able to hear thoroughly from all interested parties.\u201d August 10, 2015 The Honorable Mary Jo White Chair Securities and Exchange Commission 100 F Street, NE Washington D.C. 20549 Dear Chair White: We respectfully write to request that the public comment period for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) May 20, 2015, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on investment company reporting modernization be extended for an additional 90 days in order to allow affected stakeholders additional opportunity to review carefully and comment on the proposal. We are specifically concerned about the SEC\u2019s proposed Rule 30e-3, which would eliminate the current requirement that important mutual fund information be transmitted to investors in paper form. Given the significant adverse impact this rule would have on our nation\u2019s small investors, especially on those who reside in rural communities without broadband connectivity, allowing sufficient time for thoughtful review and commentary on the proposed rule is an appropriate precaution to ensure the SEC is able to hear thoroughly from all interested parties. Under current SEC rules, mutual fund investors may already choose to opt-in to electronic delivery of financial reports. Only a small percentage, however, chooses to do so.\u00a0 As proposed, Rule 30e-3 would permit funds to satisfy shareholder report requirements by simply making shareholder reports and quarterly portfolio holdings available online, unless otherwise requested.\u00a0 Investors would be sent a letter announcing the switch to digital delivery.\u00a0 A lack of response would be deemed \u201cimplied consent\u201d to the switch.\u00a0 The effect of such a change would be to shift the burden onto investors. We have a number of concerns about this proposal, including the potential for the letter to opt-out of electronic delivery to be inadvertently discarded and for access to important information that investors need to make investment decisions to be impeded.\u00a0 This concern is especially relevant for rural consumers, elderly investors, those with disabilities, and minority Americans who are less likely to have regular Internet access. We appreciate that you flagged this as a potential issue on which you wanted to receive comments.\u00a0 It is clear that in drafting the rule, the SEC attempted to protect those who will continue to rely on paper as the rule acknowledges that \u201cit is critical that these investors continue to receive disclosure in a means that is convenient and accessible for them.\u201d\u00a0 Our concern, however, is that the safeguards in the proposed rule will not adequately ensure that those who rely on paper delivery will continue to have access to this important information. Eliminating the current default requirement of paper delivery in favor of electronic delivery may be a cost-saving measure for investment companies, but potential savings could come at a price for those U.S. investors.\u00a0 Data suggest that vast cross-sections of the investing public do not prefer, or cannot reliably depend on electronic delivery.\u00a0 According to the SEC\u2019s own study conducted by Siegel + Gale in 2012, 71 percent of investors said they prefer to read annual reports in paper format.\u00a0 Many interested stakeholders did not become aware of the proposal until recently and would like an opportunity to provide input. For this reason, the current 60 day comment period is not sufficient for the SEC to evaluate fully the potential impacts of Rule 30e-3. We, therefore, respectfully urge the SEC to extend the comment period for its NPRM by an additional 90 days.\u00a0 Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your prompt response to our request."},

We represent parts of coastal New England, a region with strong cultural and economic ties to the American lobster. We recognize the importance of sound fisheries management, and as such, have the utmost respect for the EU\u2019s desire to develop environmental policy based on rigorous scientific analysis.

To learn more about this virus and other public health challenges, I recently toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, with my friend and colleague Senator Johnny Isakson.\u00a0 I was deeply impressed by the team of extraordinarily dedicated public servants who work there.\u00a0 These scientists leverage an enormous range of knowledge to protect the American people, including through rapid response to infectious disease threats. I was particularly alarmed by the scientific models we were shown that demonstrated how quickly and widely this virus can spread.\u00a0 CDC\u2019s experts told me that they call the mosquito that carries the Zika virus the \u201ccockroach of the mosquito world\u201d because it is so difficult to get rid of.\u00a0 This mosquito can breed in the water that fits inside the size of a bottle cap.\u00a0 It is commonly found in the United States in areas such as Florida and our Gulf Coast, and it also transmits diseases like dengue fever and chikungunya.\u00a0 As of May 18, 2016, there are nearly 1,400 cases of Zika virus in the United States and its three territories, including three laboratory-confirmed cases in the State of Maine.\u00a0 In addition, the CDC recently announced that the number of Zika cases among pregnant women in the United States has increased from 48 to 157.\u00a0 While the natural range of the Zika-carrying mosquito poses the greatest immediate threat to our southern states, the fact is that there are confirmed Zika cases in virtually every single state due to travel.\u00a0 Puerto Rico has been especially hard hit, with the number of locally acquired cases topping 700.\u00a0 These statistics are even more alarming when you consider that we have not yet reached the summer months when mosquitos tend to be more prevalent.\u00a0 Recent studies suggest that Zika might spread across the warmer and wetter parts of the Western Hemisphere.\u00a0 As many as 200 million people in our country live in areas where the mosquito that carries the virus could potentially thrive. Americans are justifiably worried about the Zika virus, as the failure to prevent its spread could have devastating consequences for our families.\u00a0 In addition to the human and emotional toll, the Zika virus may ultimately cost the United States an astonishing sum of money when you consider that we already spend more than $2.6 billion per year on hospital stays related to birth defects. It is imperative that we take steps to combat the Zika virus without delay.\u00a0 As the Chairman of the Senate Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, I strongly supported a bipartisan amendment to provide $1.1 billion in emergency funding to address the Zika threat.\u00a0 This crucial funding includes $361 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and $200 million for the National Institutes of Health.\u00a0 Washington should do more to plan for emerging disease threats through the regular appropriations process so that we do not have to turn frequently to emergency supplemental funding.\u00a0 But the Zika virus is an imminent and evolving public health threat that cannot wait, that cannot be ignored.\u00a0 The CDC has a very specific plan to rapidly respond to this serious threat, including developing diagnostic tests that will help us identify the virus and helping to educate providers and the public about appropriate prevention methods.\u00a0 The role of the CDC is particularly important because it is the interface with state and local public health centers and agencies, so it is absolutely critical in the education and prevention process. The NIH is similarly prepared to conduct research into vaccines that might help us better prevent the virus and the conditions that it can tragically cause.\u00a0 But again, that requires funding. The CDC has sounded the alarm in its warning about a serious Zika outbreak in our country.\u00a0 It is essential that we devote sufficient financial resources to meet this new challenge. I am proud that the Senate is doing its part to deal with this serious threat to our public health."},

{"title": "Collins, King Urge Action On Delayed VA Medical Leases", "date": ["Posted Tue, 05/24/2016 - 14:45"], "release": "\u2013 Today, U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King joined a bipartisan group of thirteen other Senators on a letter urging the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs to authorize leases for eighteen major medical facilities across twelve states that have been awaiting congressional authorization for over a year, including a potential outpatient facility in Portland, Maine. Under current law, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) must receive specific legislative authorization to lease medical facilities with average annual rental payments in excess of $1 million. But since 2012, Congress has not, through a regular process, authorized any VA major medical facility leases, hampering the ability of the VA to provide much-needed health care and services to veterans around the country. \u201cThese lease authorizations are needed to enable the VA to deliver care and services to veterans across the United States,\u201d   \u201cAs such, we ask that you act swiftly to authorize these pending leases until a more permanent solution to the issue can be found. Inaction on this issue hampers the ability of veterans in our states to access timely and quality care from the VA.\u201d Among the projects stuck in limbo is a proposed collaboration between the VA Maine Healthcare System, Maine Medical Center, and Tufts University Center of Medicine to create an outpatient facility in Portland aimed at improving veteran access to care. This public-private partnership is based on patient care, education, and research. One reason for the delay in congressional authorization has been a recent change in the way that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scores these leases. Prior to 2012, the VA classified major medical facility leases as operating leases and recorded the obligations on an annual basis in an amount equal to the lease payments due in that year, and the CBO used VA\u2019s classification to score the legislation. In 2012, CBO determined that budget authority for these leases, many of which cover a 20-year period, should be recorded up front when the leases are initiated and the acquisition occurs, not when the debt is repaid. As such, scoring for legislation that authorized these leases increased significantly, even though actual spending would not increase and the leases are ultimately subject to annual appropriations. The scoring change has stymied efforts to authorize any VA major medical facility leases. Currently, eighteen leases in twelve states from fiscal years 2015 and 2016 have been pending authorization in Congress for more than one year. The CBO scores the overall cost of these eighteen leases at $904 million. In a letter to the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee today, the Senators urged the Committee to allow leases to go forward on the eighteen facilities from FY 2016 and FY 2017 while Congress seeks a more permanent resolution on the scoring challenges. The other Senators who signed the letter today are: Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Michael Bennet (D-Col.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

Senator Collins has consistently advocated for a permanent change to the DoD\u2019s policy to ensure that per diem and lodging rates reflect actual costs and workers are not forced to pay for expenses out of pocket.\u00a0 Last month, Senator Collins   that would mandate this policy change.\u00a0 Senator Collins also   to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter in February seeking a waiver of the policy for civilian Naval shipyard workers. Dear Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed: As you finalize your work on the fiscal year (FY) 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, I write in strong support of permanently changing the Department of Defense\u2019s (DoD) long-term temporary duty (TDY) policy under the Joint Travel Regulation (JTR) as it applies to civilian public naval shipyard workers.\u00a0 While I understand the need to scrutinize costs carefully in order to eliminate waste, I believe that failure to permanently change this policy would place our nation\u2019s Naval fleet readiness at risk, harm mission-essential shipyard workers, and end up costing more money. According to Admiral William Hilarides, Commander of Naval Sea Systems Command, the reduced reimbursement rate for long-term TDY is currently jeopardizing the ability of public naval shipyards to effectively and efficiently conduct Navy ship maintenance, modernization, and repair.\u00a0 Additionally, the policy is projected to increase end costs of projects, which undermines the intent of implementing the change.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Department\u2019s approach is also harming our shipyard workers, who often conduct long-term TDY assignments.\u00a0 I am concerned that this new policy may reduce the number of shipyard workers who are willing to volunteer to perform long-term TDY travel as the reduced rates are insufficient to cover all TDY expenses.\u00a0 We owe our dedicated shipyard workers, who make great sacrifices on our behalf, the assurance that they will not be responsible for expenses that should be paid for by the government.\u00a0 I appreciate your willingness to consider this request and look forward to working with you to resolve this issue."},

In addition, the current restriction on transit stops means that U.S. airports, such as Bangor International Airport, not only lose revenue related to flights to or from Cuba, they are also passed over by foreign carriers traveling to or from other destinations in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean. Permitting these stops would not result in any incremental benefits to Cuba because these flights currently make transit stops in Canada.\u00a0 The Collins-King legislation would simply allow U.S. airports to compete on a fair and level playing field with Canadian airports that currently provide this service without restriction by the Canadian government."},

Instead of outfitting service men and women with American-made athletic shoes, as it does with every other uniform item, including boots and dress shoes, the Defense Department provides them with an allowance to buy shoes from any source, including low-wage manufacturers in China and Vietnam. This misguided policy is especially harmful to the roughly 900 men and women who work at three New Balance factories in Maine, producing the best athletic footwear in the world.\u00a0 Like their colleagues at New Balance factories in Massachusetts, these skilled Maine workers cherish their status as the only company still making athletic shoes in America.\u00a0 As a 110-year-old company that makes shoes used by top athletes the world over, New Balance represents the very best of our manufacturing past, present, and future.\u00a0 After years of urging a change in policy, I joined with Senator Angus King in authoring legislation in 2013 requiring the U.S. military to purchase American-made footwear for its recruits. In addition, senior Defense officials visited New Balance at our request to see firsthand that America produces high-quality athletic shoes at a cost comparable to what we are already allocating to our service members for such footwear.\u00a0 These efforts appeared to bear fruit in 2014, when the Defense Department decided it would require recruits to use their allowance for \u201cMade in the USA\u201d athletic shoes.\u00a0 This announcement was a \u201cwin-win\u201d for both our recruits and our industry.\u00a0 New Balance responded by investing in a new shoe design and equipment for three types of athletic shoes that would meet military specifications.\u00a0 Since then, however, the Defense Department has reversed this policy decision.\u00a0 As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I raised this issue with Defense Secretary Ash Carter during a recent hearing on the defense budget.\u00a0 I expressed to him my deep disappointment in his department\u2019s reversal of its commitment to provide American-made footwear to our new recruits and reminded him that, under the 1941 law, our military personnel are to be outfitted with American-made clothing and equipment whenever possible. It is important to note that the Berry Amendment was not only enacted to support American businesses. It also ensures that our military will have the equipment it needs should foreign trade be interrupted by war. Senator King and I have again teamed up to introduce legislation that will support American jobs by requiring the Defense Department to provide service men and women in the Armed Forces with American-made athletic shoes upon arrival at basic training.\u00a0 In announcing our bill, I observed that the President said in his State of the Union address that one of his top priorities is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.\u00a0 We share this priority, and one way we can make that possible is to make sure that the athletic footwear purchased every year by military recruits is made in the U.S.A."},

{"title": "Investing in Lead Abatement: Protecting Maine Families from a Hidden Danger", "date": ["Posted Tue, 05/17/2016 - 13:26"], "release": "The drinking-water crisis in Flint, Michigan, has heightened awareness of the danger lead poisoning poses to human health, especially to children and pregnant women.\u00a0\u00a0 Lead, in both paint and plumbing, is a particularly serious health threat here in New England where our housing stock is older than in most other states.\u00a0 Over the past 30 years, we have made great strides in reducing the lead in our homes and other buildings, but much work remains to be done. Recognizing the danger posed by lead paint, the federal government banned the manufacturing of residential lead paint in 1978.\u00a0 Maine children, however, remain at a high risk for lead poisoning because more than 60 percent of our state\u2019s homes were built prior to 1978. \u00a0 Furthermore, homes that were built before 1950 have the highest lead concentration in their paint.\u00a0 Children may become exposed to lead by eating paint chips, but exposure from paint is most harmful when dust is inhaled from flaking or peeling lead-based paints.\u00a0 Lead poisoning presents an even greater threat in low-income communities that do not have the resources to pursue lead abatement programs. Since the beginning of my service in the U.S. Senate, I have worked to raise awareness and secure important investments to help protect our children and families from this dangerous and too often unseen problem.\u00a0 In 1999, during my first term in office, I held a field hearing on lead poisoning in Lewiston.\u00a0 Since that time, I have strongly advocated for increased funding for programs to address lead abatement, such as the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction program.\u00a0 As Chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, I have successfully secured robust funding for this important program in this year\u2019s bipartisan funding bill.\u00a0 The Appropriations Committee unanimously approved the THUD bill, which includes my provisions to increase the federal government\u2019s commitment to lead abatement.\u00a0\u00a0 As I write this column, the bill is being considered by the full Senate.\u00a0 The bill has several important lead-related provisions.\u00a0 First, it requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development to lower its acceptable blood lead level to match the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control.\u00a0 In 2012, the CDC lowered its blood lead limit for children from 10 to 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood, but HUD has not updated its guidelines since 1999.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the HUD standard allows children\u2019s blood lead levels to be three to four times higher than the CDC standard before action is required to address lead hazards in public and assisted housing.\u00a0\u00a0 Our provisions would change that. Second, it provides $135 million for Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes grants, which is $25 million more than both this year\u2019s funding level and the President\u2019s budget request for the coming year. This increased funding level will provide safer homes for more than 6,200 additional low-income families, including those living in studios and efficiency apartments that are currently not eligible for these grants.\u00a0 Third, it provides $25 million to public housing authorities to address lead-based paint hazards in public housing units. This funding will allow authorities to conduct abatements, interim controls, and risk assessments in units where children six years of age or younger reside.\u00a0 Fourth, it requires HUD to provide guidance to Public Housing Authorities (PHA) on lead-related regulations as well as provide training and publicize best practices on making and keeping housing lead safe.\u00a0 PHAs are also encouraged to improve tenant awareness and education, and train their maintenance and property management staff on safe inspection and abatement practices. At least 4 million American households have children that are being exposed to high levels of lead. There are approximately half a million children five years old or younger with blood lead levels above 5 micrograms, the level at which the CDC recommends public health actions be initiated. Lead can harm anyone who is exposed; however, it presents the greatest health risk to the most vulnerable. While children who suffer from low-level lead poisoning may not exhibit obvious symptoms, research is increasingly showing that even relatively low levels of lead exposure can cause reductions in IQ and attention span, reading and learning disabilities, hyperactivity, and behavioral problems, all of which can threaten a child\u2019s ability to achieve his or her full potential. The long-term effects of lead poisoning are truly alarming and often irreversible. Despite our efforts to fight this largely preventable health problem, lead poisoning remains one of the most prevalent environmental health problems facing children today.\u00a0 We must continue our efforts to eradicate this health threat."},

{"title": "Reversing the Trend: Investing in Education, Treatment, and Law Enforcement to Address Our Nation\u2019s Heroin and Opioid Abuse Epidemic", "date": ["Posted Tue, 04/26/2016 - 11:08"], "release": "Throughout the United States, prescription drug abuse is devastating individuals, families, and communities.\u00a0 Increasingly, the drug crisis stemming from opioid prescription painkillers is becoming a heroin crisis, as those who become addicted turn to the cheaper, readily available illicit drug. Maine has been severely harmed by this epidemic.\u00a0 Last year, our state experienced a record 272 deaths caused by drug overdose \u2013 107 from heroin, plus another 50 from prescription opioids.\u00a0 That total is 64 deaths more than in 2014.\u00a0 The upward trend is undeniable: overdose deaths in Maine increased by 34 percent between 2012 and 2014.\u00a0 Even more alarming is the fact that drug overdose deaths in Maine nearly doubled \u2013 an increase of 96 percent \u2013 between 1999 and 2012. This spiraling epidemic requires action.\u00a0 As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I worked to secure the Committee\u2019s recent approval of $132 million to combat this crisis.\u00a0 This legislation, which passed unanimously in the Committee and will now be taken up by the full Senate, funds vital programs to support law enforcement and treatment. The funding bill includes $10 million for the COPS Anti-Heroin Task Force, a vital increase of $3 million from the previous fiscal year.\u00a0 The Task Force supports competitive grants to law enforcement with high per capita levels of primary treatment admissions for heroin and other opioids, and it has helped some of the hardest-hit communities, including many in Maine.\u00a0 In September 2015, the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency at Augusta received nearly $400,000 through this program. The\u00a0bill also makes an important combined investment of $49 million in Drug Courts and Veterans Treatment Courts.\u00a0 I have seen first-hand the difference that these courts can make in helping individuals overcome their addictions, avoid imprisonment, and change their lives. Some of the additional provisions directed toward stopping the heroin and opioid abuse crisis include $12.5 million for the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s request for four new heroin enforcement squads and $14 million for prescription drug monitoring to help reduce the diversion of prescription painkillers from legitimate purposes to abuse. A crucial investment the bill makes is $14 million for the Justice Department\u2019s grant programs that provide prevention and treatment opportunities. The number of Mainers seeking treatment for opiate addiction tripled from 1,115 in 2011 to 3,463 in 2014.\u00a0 During the last six years, admissions to treatment programs in Maine for heroin or prescription opioid addiction increased by a staggering 90 percent. This funding measure complements the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, known as CARA, which passed the Senate in March. That bipartisan legislation, which I cosponsored, takes the kind of multifaceted approach needed to address the opioid abuse and heroin epidemic. CARA would authorize several grant programs and task forces to help communities combat substance abuse and overdose deaths and to expand treatment and prevention efforts.\u00a0 The bill targets substance abuse recovery services for young people in schools and colleges, as well as treatment services for pregnant and postpartum women.\u00a0 The bill would also provide support for expanding drug takeback programs, an initiative I have long supported and which helped collect more than 350 tons of unneeded medications last year in Maine alone. \u00a0These programs provide an important way for individuals to safely and securely dispose of their unused prescription drugs. Increasingly, heroin is the primary substance involved in addiction.\u00a0 There is no question that international drug cartels and inner-city drug gangs have targeted Maine as an emerging and lucrative market for heroin.\u00a0 Federal law enforcement officials have briefed me on the link between the straw purchasing of firearms and the heroin crisis, where out-of-state drug dealers find addicts with clean records to buy guns and then exchange the guns for heroin.\u00a0 That makes the combination of increased support for both law-enforcement and treatment in this bill so crucial. Perhaps most tragic is the effect of addiction on the most vulnerable in our society \u2013 the babies born to addicts.\u00a0 In Maine last year, nearly 1,000 babies were born drug and/or alcohol-addicted, a number which represents eight percent of all births in our state.\u00a0 Last year, I helped champion the Protecting our Infants Act, bipartisan legislation that would help develop a strategy to address research and treatment gaps for opioid abuse among pregnant women.\u00a0 Our legislation became law in November of 2015. It is also essential that we increase our efforts to educate teens about the dangers of opioid abuse.\u00a0 According to a national study in 2013, the percentage of adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 who perceived that using heroin once or twice a week to be a great risk was lower than in previous years.\u00a0\u00a0 We must reverse this trend. The addiction epidemic is sweeping through emergency rooms, jails, and homes here in Maine and throughout the country.\u00a0 We can stop its spread and push back against this destructive tide with the combination of education, treatment, and law enforcement investments that these bills support."},

{"title": "Soaring Prices on Decades-old Drugs ", "date": ["Posted Fri, 05/06/2016 - 12:41"], "release": "Berna Heyman, a retired college librarian from Williamsburg, Virginia, has Wilson disease, an inherited disorder that prevents copper from being excreted from the body, allowing dangerous accumulations. Untreated, it can cause serious liver, brain, and eye problems and even lead to death. Treated, the individual can live a normal life. There are, however, very few medicines that can treat Wilson disease. The main drugs are Syprine and Cuprimine. For years, Mrs. Heyman took Syprine, which worked well for her. Then Valeant Pharmaceuticals purchased Syprine and hiked its price from $652 for a monthly supply to an outrageous $21,267. The company bought Cuprimine, too, and jacked up its price by nearly 6,000 percent.\u00a0 Suddenly, Mrs. Heyman could no longer afford the copay on the medicine that she needed to avoid the terrible consequences of Wilson disease. She and her doctor searched frantically for an alternative and for financial assistance. Valeant didn't spend a penny in research and development for Syprine and Cuprimine. Their manufacturing costs didn't go up. So why did Valeant jack up the prices of these two life-saving drugs?\u00a0 Greed. The Senate Aging Committee, which I chair, recently held a hearing on Valeant Pharmaceuticals and the sky-high price increases it imposed on Syprine and Cuprimine, as well as for two other drugs it controls: Nitropress, and Isuprel.\u00a0 Valeant has increased the prices of all four drugs by hundreds or even thousands of percentage points.\u00a0 This was the third in a series of hearings the Committee has held regarding egregious price spikes for decades-old prescription drugs as part of a months-long bipartisan investigation.\u00a0 Over the course of our investigation, the Committee interviewed dozens of patients like Mrs. Heyman, doctors, and health care experts from around the country and reviewed nearly a million pages of documents to better understand the causes and effects of these egregious price hikes and determine what Congress can do to counter them. Since last fall, Valeant has said that the business unit that houses the four drugs we examined is \u201cnot core to its business or strategy\u201d and is getting \u201csmaller and smaller\u201d as a share of net revenue. But the data that we reviewed revealed that the net revenues from these four drugs is rising \u2013 not falling. Indeed, their contribution to Valeant\u2019s net income rose to a significant 23.3 percent in February. These price spikes thus appear to be very much the core of the company\u2019s business strategy. Among the witnesses at our latest hearing was the former CEO of Valeant, J. Michael Pearson.\u00a0 It was somewhat encouraging to hear Mr. Pearson say he regretted his decision to increase prices on certain decades-old drugs after his company acquired them and that price reductions were under consideration.\u00a0 It remains to be seen whether the new CEO will follow through and whether any reductions will come close to undoing the unconscionable increases. Developing drugs is usually an enormously time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process. It often takes more than a decade to bring a new drug from the laboratory to the market, and estimates of the average cost of doing so range from hundreds of millions of dollars to well over a billion dollars. Moreover, the chance a new drug will succeed is highly uncertain. If we want new medicines to reach consumers who need them, the companies that invest in the research and take the risks necessary to develop these drugs must see a fair return on their investment. But the kind of price manipulation carried out by Valeant is a market failure with real consequences for patients like Mrs. Heyman. It has consequences for doctors who are treating individuals who need these drugs. It has consequences for our hospitals at a time when they are trying to lower health care costs, and they can\u2019t control the cost of these drugs that they desperately need to treat their patients. This abuse of pricing is also a failure of the processes we have in the federal government to try to incentivize lower-priced generics to come to market and compete with such monopoly drugs. To protect the American public, Congress must act to address this price manipulation.\u00a0 We need policy reforms, such as the bipartisan legislation I have introduced with the Ranking Member of the Aging Committee, Senator Claire McCaskill, to fast-track the approval of certain generic drugs, especially those that could compete with decades-old drugs that are vulnerable to the abusive pricing we have seen from Valeant and certain other companies.\u00a0 Our investigation has exposed the problem; we must now work to get solutions so that patients like Mrs. Heyman can access the lifesaving treatment they need."},

{"title": "Assessing the Progress and the Work to be Done in the Fight to End Alzheimer\u2019s", "date": ["Posted Fri, 04/08/2016 - 13:44"], "release": "When I was back home in Maine recently, I saw an 88-year-old woman taking care of her 90-year-old husband with Alzheimer\u2019s.\u00a0 I also spoke with a woman in her 50s who, with her sisters, is juggling their busy work schedules with the care of their mother who has Alzheimer\u2019s.\u00a0 And I talked to a man trying to cope with his wife\u2019s dementia as well as his own health problems. As families throughout the country can attest, Alzheimer\u2019s is a devastating disease that exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on individuals, families, and our health care system.\u00a0 The Centers for Disease Control lists Alzheimer\u2019s as the sixth leading cause of death in our country.\u00a0 Approximately 5.4 million Americans are living with Alzheimer\u2019s today, including 37,000 in the State of Maine. That number is soaring as our overall population grows older and lives longer.\u00a0 If current trends continue, Alzheimer\u2019s disease could affect as many as 16 million Americans by the year 2050. In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer\u2019s is our nation\u2019s costliest disease.\u00a0 The United States spends more than $236 billion per year, including $160 billion in costs to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, caring for people with Alzheimer\u2019s.\u00a0 It is the only one of our nation\u2019s top ten diseases without an effective means of prevention, treatment, or a cure.\u00a0 If we do nothing, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association forecasts that the disease will cost the United States an astonishing $1.1 trillion by 2050. Despite these alarming statistics, for too long our efforts to fight this disease lacked coordination and focus.\u00a0 It was not until the bipartisan National Alzheimer\u2019s Project Act I co-authored in 2011 with former Senator Evan Bayh that a strategic national plan to combat Alzheimer\u2019s was created, and it has since been updated annually.\u00a0 NAPA focuses our efforts to accelerate progress toward better treatments, a means of prevention, and ultimately, a cure. NAPA provides a roadmap to a better future by setting the primary goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer\u2019s by 2025.\u00a0 That legislation created an expert council, which determined that $2 billion per year is needed to achieve that goal. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I worked to turn the words of that recommendation into action.\u00a0 The spending bill passed last year includes a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, the largest increase since 2004.\u00a0 That includes a $350 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s research, the largest in history, bringing the total to $991 million \u2013 a more than 50 percent increase and almost half-way to our $2 billion-per-year goal. I recently chaired a Senate Aging Committee hearing to assess the progress we have made toward the goal of ending Alzheimer\u2019s by 2025.\u00a0\u00a0 Our panel of expert witnesses described many encouraging steps we have taken in the past five years since NAPA became law to advance both research and support for patients and caregivers, and they offered keen insight into what more we must do to achieve our goals by the year 2025. One of our witnesses was Dr. Ron Petersen, chairman of the advisory council established by NAPA and director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center.\u00a0 While the ultimate goal of NAPA is to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer\u2019s by 2025, Dr. Petersen said the first goal is to delay the onset or slow the progression of the disease.\u00a0 That, he said, is an achievable goal toward which we are making progress.\u00a0 The increased funding for research has dramatically expanded both the number and quality of research projects and clinical trials. Nonetheless, his statement that Alzheimer\u2019s is the only one of the major chronic diseases -- such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, heart disease, and diabetes -- with an annual death rate that continues to increase was a sobering reminder that we have much farther to go. In addition to an update on the status of research, the Committee heard from witnesses on the caregiving side of the equation.\u00a0 Among them was the award-winning actor David Hyde Pierce, who has experienced the heartbreak of Alzheimer\u2019s in his own family.\u00a0 Mr. Pierce has been an effective advocate for Alzheimer\u2019s care for nearly two decades and has served on the advisory council created by NAPA.\u00a0 He said that while the research community is moving forward, similar progress is lacking in our efforts to enhance the quality of care and support for Alzheimer\u2019s patients and their families. To address this gap, I have introduced bipartisan legislation that would develop a national strategy to recognize and support caregivers.\u00a0 The RAISE Family Caregivers Act has passed unanimously in the Senate and now awaits action in the House of Representatives. I was especially pleased to invite to the hearing Polly Bradley, who is Director of Adult Services at the Southern Maine Agency on Aging.\u00a0 She described to the Committee the vital importance of the adult day services her agency provides for both dementia patients and their families.\u00a0 The two centers operated by SMAA serve some 200 families with a welcoming, person-centered approach that encourages social interaction and activity that helps maintain physical and emotional health as well as cognitive function.\u00a0 These programs also support the overall physical health and emotional wellbeing of family caregivers by giving them a much-needed respite from the 24/7 care of their loved ones with Alzheimer\u2019s. As we tackle Alzheimer\u2019s complexities through scientific research, we must never forget these family caregivers, who are truly heroes.\u00a0 Our caregivers make many personal and financial sacrifices to ensure that their loved ones have the care that they need. It is essential that federal policies support them in this difficult challenge. Our hearing coincided with a national Alzheimer\u2019s conference that brought more than a thousand dedicated advocates to Washington.\u00a0 I look forward to continuing to work with advocates and scientists to achieve a world where Alzheimer\u2019s can be treated, cured, or, best of all, prevented."},

A significant part of the American lobster industry\u2019s economic impact \u2013 nearly $200 million each year \u2013comes from trans-Atlantic trade.\u00a0 That trade is threatened by efforts taken by the Government of Sweden to reclassify North American lobsters as an invasive species, which would effectively ban the importation of live Maine lobsters to the entire 28-country European Union.\u00a0 I have joined with my Maine congressional colleagues \u2013 Senator King and Representatives Pingree and Poliquin \u2013 to ask three top Obama Administration officials to stop these efforts.\u00a0 In our letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, and NOAA Administrator Dr. Kathryn Sullivan, we note that live Maine lobsters have been exported around the world for decades, and the risk of those lobsters breeding with European species is very low. Live lobsters are Maine\u2019s top export to the EU, so any attempt to halt their import would have serious ramifications for Maine lobstermen and women, their families, coastal communities, and our entire state.\u00a0 Access to the European market helps sustain Maine\u2019s maritime economy. It is critical that any action undertaken by the European Commission be consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization.\u00a0 Among those rules, the WTO requires that animal health protection measures be based upon scientific principles and supported by scientific evidence.\u00a0 Moreover, the WTO does not allow such measures if they are used to disguise restrictions on international trade for economic purposes. The science simply does not support Sweden\u2019s position.\u00a0 For decades, Maine has safely exported live lobster around the world.\u00a0 Studies by the University of Maine, a global leader in the scientific study of lobsters, have indicated that the risk of Maine lobsters interbreeding with European lobsters is extraordinarily low.\u00a0 Our University researchers also report that disease transmissions risks associated with inadvertent contact are small due to the significant differences between European and Maine sea temperatures. According to the EU\u2019s own regulations, the appearance of an alien species in a new location is not necessarily a cause for concern.\u00a0 Since only a small number of Maine lobsters have been found in foreign waters, EU regulators should take a finely-tuned approach before branding the very limited presence of Maine lobsters as an \u201cinvasion.\u201d Some reports suggest that individuals are intentionally releasing Maine lobsters in European waters.\u00a0 If this is the case, such a violation should be handled first by local law enforcement \u2013 as it is in Maine \u2013 rather than be used as a barrier to international trade. My Maine colleagues and I are urging Administration officials to help make certain that the European Commission exhausts all reasonable options to deal with this issue before potentially alienating an important trading partner.\u00a0 It is in the best interest of all parties to maintain this sector of trans-Atlantic trade that supports so many Mainers and their families.\u00a0 Our lobstermen and women have heeded calls by President Obama to build export markets.\u00a0 It is essential that our government works to ensure that the EU does not erect unjustified barriers to those markets."},

Although the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 made trade secret theft a crime, the Department of Justice lacks the resources to prosecute many such cases. State-level civil trade secret laws alone have not been sufficient to stop interstate theft.

TAA plays an essential role in helping Americans across our country who, through no fault of their own, have lost their jobs as a result of foreign\u2014and often unfair\u2014competition. Our workers are the best in the world, and they can compete when there is a level playing field. TAA programs provide a crucial lifeline that enables displaced workers to acquire the new skills and training necessary to prepare for and pursue jobs in other industries,\u201d    . TAA is a program of the Department of Labor that helps workers who have lost their jobs as a result of increased imports or a shift of production outside of the United States. TAA provides these trade-affected workers with a variety of reemployment services and benefits to help them find new jobs and get back to work. In the 2013 fiscal year alone, more than 700 Mainers used TAA programs, and more than 70 percent of those participants found employment within three months of completing their retraining programs. In addition, of the participants who found employment, more than 90 percent were still employed in their new jobs six months later.

Washington, DC\u00a0 20210 Dear Mr. Secretary: We are writing in support of the recently filed Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) petition to assist the more than 200 workers at Madison Paper Industries in Madison, Maine, who are being displaced due in large measure to increased foreign competition within the supercalendered paper industry. Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission (ITC) investigated imports of supercalendered paper from Canada. As part of this inquiry, the Department investigated Port Hawkesbury Paper in Nova Scotia and Resolute Forest Products in Quebec and determined that imports of supercalendered paper from these mills received countervailable subsidies ranging from 17.87 percent to 20.18 percent. In December 2015, the ITC determined that the domestic industry was materially injured by these imports. Given the closing of three other major pulp and paper mills within 125 miles of Madison in the past two years and the bankruptcy restructuring of a fourth, the skilled Madison mill workers face an enormous hurdle in identifying and securing meaningful alternative employment in the area for which they have the qualifying experience. As a result, it is crucial that these workers receive the retraining and reemployment resources available through TAA certification.\u00a0Such a certification will allow them to get back on their feet more quickly and continue making critical contributions to their families and our economy. We urge that you review this TAA application in a timely manner, consistent with all applicable rules and regulations, to ensure that these trade-affected workers receive the assistance they need to obtain work and maintain their financial stability.\u00a0 Thank you for your consideration on behalf of the workers at the Madison Paper Industries.

This important investment will initiate and bolster local conservation and recreation efforts in our state, helping to ensure both current and future generations can enjoy the beauty of Maine\u2019s natural resources.\u201d Senator Collins, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Senator King, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee have long supported efforts to support the LWCF, including matching federal grants to states and local communities to develop outdoor recreation facilities, parks, and resources, and funding to support the acquisition of key parcels within Acadia National Park, a true gem of the Maine coastline. Last September, Senator Collins led a bipartisan coalition of Senators, including Senator King,   to permanently reauthorize and adequately fund the LWCF. Senator Collins   that was signed into law last year. Additionally, both Senator Collins and Senator King are cosponsors of bipartisan legislation that would permanently reauthorize LWCF, S. 338. The LWCF was established by Congress in 1965 to ensure access to outdoor recreation resources for present and future generations, and to provide money to federal agencies and state and local governments to purchase land, water, and wetlands for the benefit of all Americans. Funds are awarded through federal matching grants that leverage public and private investment and enable state and local governments to create, develop, or enhance everything from urban parks to state wildlife management areas to soccer fields. The funds also provide the public with access to rivers, lakes, and other water resources, and permanently conserve these areas for outdoor recreational use and enjoyment.\u00a0 A recent analysis of the Land and Water Conservation Fund found that every $1 invested in land acquisition generated a $4 return on investment for communities."},

In 1919, a remarkable Englishwoman named Eglantyne Jebb stepped forward and began organizing protests in London over the inhumane blockade. She was arrested, put on trial, found guilty, and ordered to pay a substantial fine. The judge, however, was so moved by her compassion and courage that he paid the fine himself.\u00a0 That was the very first donation to the charity Eglantyne Jebb founded: Save the Children. Today, nearly a century later, Save the Children works in 120 countries, including the United States, and each year helps more than 166 million children receive the food, health care, education, and protection they deserve.\u00a0 It is ranked as one of the most trusted and effective charities in the world. I was recently honored to receive a \u201cChampion for Children\u201d award from Save the Children and the Save the Children Action Network.\u00a0 It was a particular pleasure to share that recognition with Senator Chris Coons of Delaware.\u00a0 Together, we have co-authored the bipartisan Reach Every Mother and Child Act.\u00a0 The REACH Act gets to the very heart of the Save the Children mission to improve the health and well-being of mothers and children in developing countries. Every single day, approximately 800 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth.\u00a0 In addition, more than 17,000 children under five years old die each day of conditions we know today how to treat. Due in part to American leadership, many lives have already been saved.\u00a0 Since 1990, the annual number of deaths of children under the age of five has been cut in half.\u00a0 Nevertheless, far too many mothers, newborns, and young children under the age of five still succumb to disease and malnutrition that could easily be prevented. It is a tragedy that so many preventable deaths still occur when so many life-saving simple, proven, and cost-effective interventions are available if we can simply reach the mothers and children who need them to survive.\u00a0 According to the U.S. Agency for International Development, a concentrated effort could end preventable maternal and child deaths worldwide by the year 2035. The REACH Act would require the Administration to develop a ten-year strategy to achieve that goal.\u00a0 The United States should be a leader but cannot take on the goal of eradicating these preventable deaths alone.\u00a0 This is why our bill requires the Administration to develop a financing framework which would leverage federal funding with funding from the private sector, non-profit organizations, partner countries, and multinational organizations toward the goal of ending preventable maternal and child deaths. In addition to my work on the REACH Act, I will be examining this issue further as a member of the bipartisan Task Force on Women\u2019s and Family Health formed by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the esteemed public policy research institution.\u00a0 The goal of this Task Force is to develop consensus on pragmatic policy recommendations for how the United States can continue to make an effective and sustained impact on global women\u2019s and family health.\u00a0 I am honored to have been named to this task force. It is vital that the United States continue to provide global leadership in the areas of maternal, newborn, and child health. Eglantyne Jebb is a shining example of how one person of conviction can make a difference.\u00a0 We are making progress to fulfill her vision of a world where all children everywhere have a healthy start in life, protection from harm, and a bright future.\u00a0"},

{"title": "Collins, King Call on Commerce Department to Spearhead Economic Development Efforts in Rural Maine", "date": ["Posted Mon, 03/14/2016 - 09:57"], "release": "\u00a0\u2013 Today, U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King called on the U.S. Department of Commerce to take immediate action to bolster Maine\u2019s forest-based economy in the wake of several mill closures that have left communities in rural Maine in the midst of an economic crisis. In a letter to Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, Senators Collins and King urged the Commerce Department to establish and lead an integrated, multi-agency Economic Development Assessment Team (EDAT) focused on Maine\u2019s forest based economy that would leverage the power of multiple federal government agencies and harness stakeholder input to create economic development strategies that would help pave the way for job growth for rural Maine communities in the years to come.\u00a0 Maine is home to vast forest and natural resources and a skilled workforce that has harvested, hauled, and processed wood from Maine\u2019s forests for generations. The Senators\u2019 letter comes at a time when the downturn of the pulp and paper industry in Maine has led to the loss of thousands of forest and manufacturing jobs, creating an economic crisis that requires urgent action. In their letter, Senators Collins and King underscored how the Commerce Department has a record of successfully responding to economic and natural disasters by bringing together partners from all levels of government to strengthen economic infrastructure. The Senators requested that the Commerce Department deploy an EDAT on the ground and leverage resources from multiple federal agencies, including the Economic Development Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Forest Service, the Department of Energy, the Small Business Administration, and others in collaboration with state and local stakeholders to focus on: Senators Collins\u2019 and King\u2019s complete letter to Commerce Secretary Pritzker is below and can be read  . +++ March 14, 2016 The Honorable Penny Pritzker Secretary U.S. Department of Commerce 1401 Constitution Avenue, NW Washington, DC \u00a020230 Dear Secretary Pritzker: We are writing to call on the U.S Department of Commerce to establish and lead an integrated, multi-agency Economic Development Assessment Team (EDAT) focused on Maine\u2019s forest based economy. \u00a0Over the past several years, the pulp and paper industry and communities that support this sector have experienced significant economic hardship as a result of a series of mill closures that have led to the loss of thousands of forest and manufacturing jobs. As these rural communities have repeatedly told us, they are in the midst of an economic crisis of unprecedented magnitude, creating a situation requiring urgent action, heightened focus and new federal economic and workforce development resources. Maine is home to vast forest and natural resources and a skilled workforce that has harvested, hauled, and processed wood from Maine\u2019s forests for generations. Unfortunately, due largely to dramatic changes in the pulp and paper markets, what was once a prosperous and robust industrial sector that provided a strong economic backbone in many rural areas is today facing a serious downturn and rapid decline. \u00a0In recent years the situation has significantly worsened in Maine, where we have seen the closures of six major mills in the last eight years, four of those in the last two years. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The once thriving rural communities that once were the homes to these mills are today hurting. \u00a0For example, the communities in the Katahdin and Lincoln area where the forest products industry provided good paying jobs spanning generations, and brought prosperity to a region once considered one of the most prosperous in the state, today are struggling after the closing of three major mills. The same situation is true in western and eastern Maine which has also experienced a similar decline in the forest products industry. If you came to listen to the people in these rural communities, which we encourage you to do, you would hear that they are facing serious economic challenges: significant jobs losses, decreasing property values, deteriorating infrastructure, lack of access to high-speed broadband, and a growing migration of people leaving the area. In response to the severity of the challenges facing Maine\u2019s forest economy, we urge the Commerce Department to form an Economic Development Assessment Team with active on the ground involvement of multiple, relevant federal agencies including the Economic Development Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Forest Service, Department of Energy, Small Business Administration, and others. This collaboration should bring together local, state and federal stakeholders, all working together to identify existing assets and new resources, to perform a gap analysis, to develop strategies that support economic development, and to increase economic diversification. This multi-agency effort in the region should focus on: Our hope is that this effort will help set the stage for the affected regions in the state to shape their own economic future by strengthening existing assets and support new innovation and ideas that create jobs and support our rural communities. The lessons learned from this multi-agency targeted effort could be used as a model for rural economies across the country that have been impacted by the decline in industry. The Department of Commerce has a proven record of leadership in responding to economic and natural disasters, working with federal, state, and local partners to help rebuild and strengthen the economic infrastructure in the affected communities where people have historically relied on local industry for good jobs and economic prosperity. \u00a0This record includes comprehensive responses in regions negatively impacted by the downturn in the coal industry, the collapse of fisheries, and the Deepwater Horizon spill. \u00a0Through these efforts, communities have been able to isolate their most important needs, assess and utilize the resources available, and receive advice and assistance from technical experts on best practices. We appreciate your careful consideration of the productive and positive role the U.S. Department of Commerce could play in helping strengthen Maine\u2019s forest economy, building stronger rural economies and helping diversify the economic future of these impacted regions. Please notify Adam Lachman (Senator King) at (202) 224-5344 and Olivia Kurtz (Senator Collins) at (202) 224-2523 if you have any questions or concerns. We look forward to hearing from you about how the Commerce Department can lead a multiagency effort to support and strengthen the future of rural communities in Maine."},

Tomorrow\u2019s hearing will take an in-depth look inside two of these hedge fund pharmaceutical companies, Turing and Retrophin, both formerly headed by Martin Shkreli, who gained notoriety last year for dramatically increasing the price of the drug Daraprim.\u00a0 Together, these two companies have produced some 400,000 pages of documents in response to Committee subpoenas.\u00a0 Through their bipartisan investigation, the Committee has uncovered the monopoly business model these companies use to identify and strategically acquire drugs that they can then exploit at the expense of patients, health care providers, private insurance plans, and federal health care programs.\u00a0 The witnesses for tomorrow\u2019s hearing will include: , former Senior Vice Present and General Counsel, Turing Pharmaceuticals, New York, New York\u00a0 , Professor of Medicine, School of Medicine; Professor of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Public Health, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill , parents of infant born with Toxoplasmosis, Whispering Pines, North Carolina\u00a0 , Interim CEO, and Chairman of the Board, Turing Pharmaceuticals, New York, New York , Co-Founder and Senior Director of Business Development, Turing Pharmaceuticals, New York, New York , Partner and Analyst, Broadfin Capital, New York, New York\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Room 562, Dirksen Senate Office Building \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Washington, D.C. :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Thursday, March 17, 2016 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 9:45 AM"},

In addition, according to the VA\u2019s own figures, the average cost per veteran in Maine using the ARCH program is less than the average cost for VHA direct care Despite this success, the ARCH Program is due to expire on August 7, 2016, and the VA is currently considering a plan to fold ARCH into the Veterans Choice Program, the VA\u2019s new and troubled community care program. While the VA implemented the Veterans Choice Program in an attempt to improve veterans\u2019 access to health care, more than half of eligible Maine veterans have experienced difficulties in receiving care under the Choice Program.\u00a0 As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I urged officials from the VA at a subcommittee hearing to extend the ARCH program and ensure that all veterans have the choice of receiving the health care they need close to home and their families.\u00a0 I stressed to VA Secretary Robert McDonald the vital importance of the ARCH Program to veterans and recommended using it as a model to reform the Choice Program.\u00a0 I also recently met with VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson in my Washington, D.C., office to emphasize the need to extend the ARCH Program.\u00a0 I illustrated Peter Miesburger\u2019s story and the experience of hundreds of other Maine veterans by showing Deputy Secretary Gibson a map displaying the distance between Northern Maine and Togus. In addition, along with Senator King, I recently introduced legislation that will extend the ARCH program for an additional five years.\u00a0 This would allow veterans in Northern Maine to continue to receive care at Cary Medical Center.\u00a0 Our legislation would also provide Congress and the VA with additional time to evaluate the success of the ARCH program. The ARCH program allows Northern Maine veterans to receive exceptionally high quality care close to home, close to their families, and when they need it.\u00a0 Given the tremendous success of ARCH measured in terms of both patient satisfaction and cost effectiveness, I will continue to advocate for the extension of this essential program to ensure that our rural veterans have local access to the health care they have earned through their service to our nation."},

Girl Scouts taught me that determination, principles, and respect for others can take you everywhere you want to go\u2014including to the halls of the United States Capitol.\u00a0 I\u2019m delighted to honor 100 years of the Girl Scout\u2019s Gold Award and remember the tremendous history of this fine organization as it celebrates the beginning of its second century of education and empowering young women.\u201d \u201cI love the Girl Scouts and I love being a Girl Scout. For more than a century, the Girl Scouts have stood for the education and empowerment of girls,\u201d   said. \u201cThe Girl Scouts teach character, honesty, integrity and competency in a movement that has changed America and the world.

Washington, DC\u00a0 20210 Dear Mr. Secretary: We are writing in support of the recently filed Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) petition to assist the more than 200 workers at Madison Paper Industries in Madison, Maine, who are being displaced due in large measure to increased foreign competition within the supercalendered paper industry. Last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission (ITC) investigated imports of supercalendered paper from Canada. As part of this inquiry, the Department investigated Port Hawkesbury Paper in Nova Scotia and Resolute Forest Products in Quebec and determined that imports of supercalendered paper from these mills received countervailable subsidies ranging from 17.87 percent to 20.18 percent. In December 2015, the ITC determined that the domestic industry was materially injured by these imports. Given the closing of three other major pulp and paper mills within 125 miles of Madison in the past two years and the bankruptcy restructuring of a fourth, the skilled Madison mill workers face an enormous hurdle in identifying and securing meaningful alternative employment in the area for which they have the qualifying experience. As a result, it is crucial that these workers receive the retraining and reemployment resources available through TAA certification.\u00a0Such a certification will allow them to get back on their feet more quickly and continue making critical contributions to their families and our economy. We urge that you review this TAA application in a timely manner, consistent with all applicable rules and regulations, to ensure that these trade-affected workers receive the assistance they need to obtain work and maintain their financial stability.\u00a0 Thank you for your consideration on behalf of the workers at the Madison Paper Industries. Sincerely,"},

The Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers are the workhorses of the Navy, and no one builds them better than the hardworking men and women at Bath Iron Works,\u201d   \u201cWith rising tensions across the globe, an additional Destroyer would help bolster the Navy\u2019s fleet, increase our presence around the world, and project American power. I am very pleased to hear that the Navy considers building this ship a top priority, and I will continue to work closely with Senator Collins and the Administration to see that Congress provides the necessary funds to do so.\u201d Senators Collins and King work together in support of Bath Iron Works from their respective positions on the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees. As a member of Armed Services, Senator King works to ensure that critical shipbuilding funding is authorized through the National Defense Authorization Act, a yearly bill that authorizes funding and directs policy for the Department of Defense. And as a senior member of Appropriations, Senator Collins works to make sure the authorized funds are then actually appropriated to shipbuilding priorities. Through this joint effort, the Senators are able to prioritize shipbuilding throughout the funding process. As of March 2, 2016, the Navy had 272 deployable battle force ships, well short of the goal set by the Navy\u2019s 30-year shipbuilding plan which calls for the United States to have 308 ships by fiscal year 2021. This investment will help to grow the Navy\u2019s combat capabilities at a time when the Navy fleet is in high demand to protect national security interests worldwide."},

Eighty-eight percent of drugs purchased are generics, which has amounted to $1.7 trillion in estimated savings.\u00a0\u00a0 In general, this balance works well;\u00a0 , the Committee\u2019s investigation revealed that some older drugs lack an FDA-approved generic competitor.\u00a0 This lack of competition is a significant contributing factor that can\u00a0allow companies to acquire and sharply increase the cost of these older drugs that are no longer protected by patents. The\u00a0 \u00a0aims to help address this issue by improving the FDA\u2019s approval process for certain generic applications.\u00a0 By promoting competition in the generic drug marketplace, the Collins-McCaskill legislation will help lower the cost and improve the accessibility of decades-old prescription drugs.\u00a0 Among other provisions, Senators Collins and McCaskill\u2019s\u00a0legislation will establish a clear timeframe for the FDA to expedite the review of certain applications for generic drugs;\u00a0direct the FDA to report quarterly to Congress on the number of new drug applications filed for review prior to October 1, 2015; and create a new \u201cgeneric priority review voucher\u201d that would be awarded to the sponsor of a successful application for a medical shortage or sole-source drug that makes it to market. By authorizing a priority review framework for generic applications and increasing transparency in the review process,\u00a0the\u00a0 \u00a0will help alleviate future shortages, increase competition to lower prices and avoid monopolies, and deter practices that can lead to exorbitant price hikes on drugs that were previously affordable to patients for decades.\u00a0"},

{"title": "Senators Collins, Cardin Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Stimulate Economic Development through the Preservation of Historic Properties", "date": ["Posted Wed, 03/09/2016 - 15:26"], "release": " U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Ben Cardin (D-MD) today introduced bipartisan legislation that would encourage economic development and job growth across the country by making common-sense changes and enhancements to the federal Historic Tax Credit (HTC). Projects that receive credits under the Historic Tax Credit Improvement Act help revitalize communities, encourage private investment, and create safer, more secure neighborhoods. \u201cThe Historic Tax Credit encourages the rehabilitation and preservation of historic buildings, helping to revitalize communities in Maine and across the nation,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cSince 2008, the Historic Tax Credit has leveraged approximately $350 million in private investment in Maine alone.\u00a0 Our bipartisan legislation will make the Historic Tax Credit easier to use and expand its economic impact - spurring growth, development, and the creation of good-paying jobs for hardworking Americans.\u201d \u201cWe can create jobs by preserving the abundant history in Maryland and across America. Improving the Historic Tax Credit will save many historically significant buildings and homes nationwide while creating quality jobs, stimulating long-term economic growth and bringing life to forgotten neighborhoods,\u201d sa  \u201cThe Historic Tax Credit has created over 2 million jobs nationwide since 1978.\u00a0 By updating the program and expanding it to reach additional projects, especially in small and rural communities, we can create thousands of jobs renovating historic properties and working in many of the restored, modernized buildings.\u201d Congress created historic preservation tax benefits in 1976 to encourage voluntary, private-sector investment in preserving historic buildings. The program is jointly managed by the National Park Service (NPS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in partnership with State Historic Preservation Offices.\u00a0 Since their creation, the HTC program has generated $78 billion in historic preservation activity to rehabilitate more than 41,250 historic properties, including the creation of over 525,000 housing units, of which approximately 150,000 are low and moderate-income units.\u00a0 Historic preservation programs have created more than 2.36 million jobs nationwide since 1978 (85,058 new jobs in FY 2015).\u00a0 A recent study by the National Trust for Historic Preservation estimates that every $1 of credits generates a minimum of $4 of private sector investment. In Maine, the federal HTC has supported numerous projects, from the renovation of the former Eastland hotel in Portland, to the redevelopment of the Moosehead Manufacturing Mill in Dover-Foxcroft. \u00a0 In Maryland, the federal HTC has supported hundreds of projects that have spurred economic growth in communities around the state, ranging from the development of a multicultural service center to affordable housing units for teachers and office space for non-profit educational organizations.\u00a0 The Historic Tax Credit Improvement Act makes changes to the HTC to further encourage building reuse and redevelopment in small, midsize, and rural communities.\u00a0 It also makes the rehabilitation of community projects like theaters, libraries, and schools easier while maximizing the impact of state historic tax credits.\u00a0 Finally, the bill would make more historic properties eligible to use the credit by updating program requirements to reflect current industry practices.\u00a0 These reforms would be the first major changes to the HTC since the Tax Reform Act of 1986. A section-by-section summary can be found below: The Historic Tax Credit Improvement Act makes changes to the Historic Tax Credit to further encourage building reuse and redevelopment in small, midsize, and rural communities.\u00a0 It also makes the rehabilitation of community projects like theaters, libraries, and schools easier while maximizing the impact of state historic tax credits.\u00a0 Finally, the bill would make more historic properties eligible to use the credit by updating program requirements to reflect current industry practices.\u00a0 These reforms would be the first major changes to the Historic Tax Credit (HTC) since the Tax Reform Act of 1986.   Creates a 30% credit for smaller deals to make sure the rural west and non-urban areas have the same ability to take advantage of the credit. This small deal credit would be capped at Qualified Rehabilitation Expenses of $2.5 million, changing the credit allowed from $500,000 to $750,000 on the largest projects. The definition of a small deal is reduced to $2.5 million in this version from $5 million in earlier versions. Allows the HTC, for small transactions with rehabilitation expenditures not over $2.5 million, to be transferred as a tax certificate, making these deals easier for small project owners. Changes the definition of substantial rehabilitation. This provision would change the threshold to qualify for the credit of 50% of adjusted basis instead of 100% of adjusted basis as the program currently requires. Changes the amount of the depreciable basis adjustment from 100 percent to 50 percent of the amount of the HTC. This would place the HTC in line with renewable energy and new market tax credits. The Low-income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) has no depreciable basis adjustment.\u00a0 Changes how the federal government taxes state historic tax credit proceeds.   Modifies the disqualified lease rules to limit the definition of a \u201cdisqualified lease\u201d to those leases that are part of a sale leaseback arrangement involving a nonprofit that has used the property before certification as a historic rehabilitation. The other types of disqualified leases that inhibit the rehabilitation of these buildings: those with purchase options, leases in excess of 20 years, and leases in buildings that use tax-exempt financing, would be eliminated."},

The Collins-Reed bill would adjust the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program to allocate formula funding based on the number of persons currently living with HIV instead of the cumulative number of AIDS cases since 1981.\u00a0 At present, 55 percent of the cumulative AIDS cases used to process the formula represent deceased individuals, which diverts funding away from parts of the country where the HIV/AIDS prevalence is more recent and unfairly distributes it to large cities that experienced the AIDS epidemic early on. \u201cThe HOPWA Program is vital to ensuring that individuals living with HIV/AIDS, who have an elevated risk of becoming homeless, are able to access safe and affordable housing,\u201d  .\u00a0 \u201cThe current method for distributing HOPWA Program funds is unfair to the regions of our country where individuals are feeling the effects of HIV/AIDS most acutely.\u00a0 Revising this outdated formula will allow these funds to benefit low-income individuals living with this illness and their families, precisely the population this program is intended to help.\u201d"},

{"title": "Protecting our Seniors:  Senate Aging Committee Unveils Comprehensive Guide to Fighting Fraud", "date": ["Posted Mon, 02/22/2016 - 12:36"], "release": "Our parents and grandparents worked hard their entire lives and saved for retirement. Unfortunately, there are criminals who are targeting them and who want to rob them of their hard-earned savings.\u00a0 The size and scope of this problem are immense. According to the Government Accountability Office, the top federal watchdog agency, America\u2019s seniors lose a staggering $2.9 billion each year to an ever-growing array of financial exploitation schemes and scams. As a Senator representing the state with the oldest median age and as Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, protecting seniors against financial exploitation and scams is one of my highest priorities. Due to the epidemic of fraud perpetrated against seniors and the extent to which victims are unsure of where they should turn for help, the Aging Committee has just published a comprehensive guide on scams titled,  . This guide is intended to raise awareness among seniors and their families of the top 10 frauds aimed at older Americans.\u00a0 It also provides tips on ways to avoid scams and lists important consumer protection agencies.\u00a0 In order to help seniors report fraud and connect them to the proper resources, the Aging Committee maintains a toll-free Fraud Hotline (1-855-303-9470).\u00a0 The Hotline is staffed by experienced fraud investigators, who receive calls from every state in the nation, but especially from Maine.\u00a0 The Hotline has proven to be an invaluable resource for seniors and has had considerable success in the fight against fraud.\u00a0 For instance, the Hotline was recently contacted by a woman from Iowa who sent nearly $4,000 to criminals before realizing that she had been scammed.\u00a0 My staff promptly called the bank and was able to stop the money from being sent overseas.\u00a0 Time is of the essence in stopping a scam once it is underway.\u00a0 If that money had already been wired, getting it back would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible. In another example, the Hotline received a call from a senior in Florida whose husband was deceived by a scam in which he sent $1,900 to con artists pretending to be IRS agents demanding immediate payment of so-called back taxes and penalties.\u00a0 We reported this to the Treasury Department, and its agents have located 155 other victims and identified two suspects. The number one complaint reported to the Fraud Hotline last year was the IRS imposter scam, like the one that cost the Florida couple $1,900.\u00a0 Victims are threatened with retaliation, such as home foreclosure and even arrest.\u00a0 With Tax Day 2016 approaching, all Americans should be on guard against this particular scam.\u00a0 In fact, my own mother recently received three such calls in one week. These scam calls most often involve a disguised, or \u201cspoofed,\u201d caller ID to make the victim believe the call is coming from the Washington, D.C., \u201c202\u201d area code, where the IRS is headquartered.\u00a0 It is important to know that the IRS will always mail a bill before trying to call.\u00a0 Anyone receiving a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS can call the Treasury Department at 1-800-366-4484, or the Aging Committee Fraud Hotline, and report it to their local police.\u00a0 Last April, I led an Aging Committee hearing examining the IRS scam.\u00a0 Our year-long efforts to increase awareness of this fraud are having positive results.\u00a0 It now takes a con artist 400 calls to find a victim, rather than the previous 50. Sweepstakes scams, where victims are told they must pay a fee to collect fictitious winnings, was second on the list. The third most-common complaint of 2015 was robocalls or unwanted phone calls. A Committee hearing examined how scammers\u2019 use of this new technology has rendered the national Do-Not-Call registry ineffective in many cases.\u00a0 Computer tech support schemes ranked fourth. Fraudsters typically claim to represent a well-known technology company and convince victims to provide them with access to their computers by telling them that their computer has been infected by a virus that must be fixed. Identity theft, the fifth most common fraud, involves the theft of a wallet or mail, online impersonation, or other illegal efforts to obtain a person\u2019s personal identifiable information. Grandparent scams, elder financial abuse by caregivers, grant scams, romance scams, and home improvement scams rounded out the top 10 most common scams perpetrated against seniors.\u00a0 While tangible progress has been made in countering scams, it is evident that more work remains to be done, and new scams are cropping up all the time. Just recently, I chaired a hearing where we heard the tragic story of a 77-year-old Maine man, a retired pastor, who was tricked by a con artist into unwittingly smuggling drugs between South America and Europe.\u00a0 Although he was not aware of the contents of the packages he was given, he was caught by customs officials and is now serving six years in a Spanish prison.\u00a0 He is just one of more than 30 Americans imprisoned overseas after being deceived into smuggling drugs. The Aging Committee remains focused on scams targeting seniors in order to encourage a more effective federal response.\u00a0 We must ensure that law enforcement has the tools it needs to pursue these criminals and that our seniors and their caregivers have the information to protect themselves.\u00a0 If you or a loved one have been scammed, or if you would like to request a copy of the Aging Committee\u2019s resource guide, please call the Aging Committee\u2019s Fraud Hotline number: 1-855-303-9470, or visit my website at  ."},

{"title": "Prescription Opioid Abuse: One of the Foremost Public Health Challenges Facing Our Nation", "date": ["Posted Tue, 03/01/2016 - 09:40"], "release": "Millions of older Americans experience pain associated with such conditions as bone fractures, cancer, post-surgery recovery, and end-of-life illnesses.\u00a0\u00a0Studies have shown that as many as 50 percent of older adults living at home and 85 percent of older adults living in residential facilities may suffer from chronic pain.\u00a0\u00a0For these older Americans, prompt delivery of pain control is a medical imperative. For many years, patients faced unacceptable barriers to effective pain management for debilitating symptoms and illnesses, and their treatment was often needlessly less than\u00a0optimal.\u00a0\u00a0More recently, however, the pendulum appears to have swung too far in the other direction. It is alarming that Americans consume opioids at a greater rate than any other nation, including twice as many opioids per capita as Canada.\u00a0\u00a0The ubiquity of\u00a0these\u00a0prescription\u00a0painkillers\u00a0is fueled in part by current federal reimbursement policies that may be unintentionally encouraging doctors to overprescribe opioids. Our physicians now face the complicated task of treating pain in an environment where abuse of prescription painkillers is one\u00a0the foremost public health challenges facing our nation.\u00a0\u00a0Prescription opioid abuse,\u00a0which\u00a0can lead\u00a0to addiction, is having devastating effects on our families and our communities.\u00a0\u00a0This problem is increasingly affecting older Americans.\u00a0\u00a0A recent study found that hospital stays resulting from opioid overuse among adults over age 65 increased more than five-fold between 1993 and 2012.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the abuse of prescription painkillers is also fueling the resurgence of heroin use across America. In response to this growing crisis affecting Maine and our nation, I recently chaired an Aging Committee hearing to examine the medical use of these drugs for pain relief and policies that may contribute to our nation\u2019s vast supply of prescription opioids.\u00a0\u00a0I invited Steven Diaz, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Emergency Medicine Physician atMaineGeneral\u00a0in Augusta, to testify about his experience on the frontlines. Seniors are prescribed more opioids than people in any other demographic group.\u00a0\u00a0While these prescriptions\u00a0canprovide critical pain relief, the home medicine cabinets of our seniors\u00a0often become an unintentional supply source for younger family members to either experiment with opioids or to fuel their addiction.\u00a0\u00a0According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency, more than 70 percent of prescription drug abusers report obtaining pills from family members\u2019 medicine cabinets. I am saddened by stories about younger individuals who are breaking the law \u2013 and breaking into older adults\u2019 homes \u2013 in order to steal prescriptions to feed their own addictions. In some cases, it is even the grandchildren stealing pills from their own grandparents. Funeral directors in Maine have told me that they sometimes advise grieving families not to cite the cause of a loved one\u2019s death in obituaries because the obituary may inadvertently advertise what prescription medications may be in the home and when the home may be empty for ransacking.\u00a0\u00a0In one tragic example, thieves broke into a home in northern Maine and stole prescription medications while the family was attending the funeral of a loved one. During the hearing, I underscored the concerns raised in a recent letter I\u00a0wrote\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The letter, which was signed by a bipartisan\u00a0group\u00a0of 26 U.S. Senators, requests that the agency review a patient survey that seeks to gauge how well a patient\u2019s pain was managed during his or her stay.\u00a0\u00a0The results of this survey help determine the amount of federal funding a hospital receives.\u00a0\u00a0The survey may inadvertently penalize hospitals if physicians, in the exercise of their best medical judgment, opt to limit opioid pain relievers to certain patients.\u00a0Consequently, physicians may prescribe more opioids than the patient needs. Dr. Diaz also referenced this patient survey\u00a0in his testimony and stated that it may be leading doctors to overprescribe. In addition, Dr. Diaz said that he believes the current system for treating chronic pain, which prioritizes prescription opioids over other pain control methods, leads to higher incidents of opioid addiction, diversion, and overdoses. Drug abuse is a national crisis that has its greatest effect at the local level --\u00a0in\u00a0our\u00a0homes, on our streets, in our schools,\u00a0and in our communities \u2013 and that touches all lives, from infants to adults.\u00a0\u00a0The Aging Committee is committed to addressing this tragic and serious crisis.\u00a0\u00a0It is encouraging that so many of my Senate colleagues from both parties who represent states across the country share my concern and are committed to finding solutions."},

In 2014, there were a record 208 overdose deaths in the State of Maine, including 57 caused by heroin, and the problem is only getting worse. \u201cIt is clear that we need to take a comprehensive approach to this epidemic, and the bill before us is a vital step forward,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cThis legislation recognizes opioid and heroin abuse for the public health crisis that it has become, and it offers meaningful and effective ways to support communities seeking to expand treatment prevention, law enforcement, and recovery efforts.\u201d Senator Collins has led efforts to address the abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers that are taking a tremendous toll on families and communities in Maine and across the United States. CARA takes the kind of multifaceted approach needed to address this epidemic by: improving drug education and prevention efforts, supporting law enforcement, combating overdoses, and expanding access to treatment, all of which would help communities contend with the growing opioid epidemic in our nation.\u00a0 This legislation has support from medical professionals, those in recovery, and other experts in the field. important part of the solution to this crisis includes examining pain management and prescribing practices. I've heard from Maine families, from physicians, and from law enforcement about a disturbing pattern of a significant percentage of individuals using heroin after abusing legal opioid medications. According to a recent report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, prescription opioid abuse does indeed put individuals at a much higher risk of heroin use. In fact, nearly 80 percent of individuals using heroin reported that they began on the road to addiction by abusing prescription pain medications.\u201d Among its provisions, CARA would create two task forces to develop best practices for the prescribing of prescription opioids and to examine policies related to examine criminal justice policies. The bill would authorize several grant programs to help communities combat substance abuse and overdose deaths and to expand treatment and prevention efforts. Other grant programs target substance abuse recovery services for young people in schools and colleges, as well as treatment services for pregnant and postpartum women. The bill would also provide support for expanding drug takeback programs, an initiative Senator Collins has long supported. \u00a0These programs provide an important way for individuals to safely and securely dispose of their unused prescription drugs. Last week, Senator Collins   titled, \u201c ,\u201d which explored the medical use of opioids for pain relief and the challenges health care providers face in treating pain in an environment where the diversion of prescription painkillers is contributing to the ongoing opioid epidemic.\u00a0 During the hearing, Senator Collins underscored the concerns raised in   regarding a possible contributing factor to the opioid crisis facing our country. The letter was signed by 26 Senators and urged Secretary Burwell to conduct a robust examination of hospital performance surveys that may be contributing to the vast supply of prescription opioids currently in circulation in our country by inadvertently penalizing hospitals if physicians, in the exercise of their best medical judgment, opt to limit opioid pain relievers to certain patients. In addition, late last year, the Senate passed\u2014and the President signed into law\u2014the Protecting our Infants Act,   that will help address the growing crisis of opioid use and abuse among pregnant women and its effect on newborn babies.\u00a0"},

{"title": "Collins, Murray Introduce Bill Cosponsored by King to Preserve Critical Savings Option During Tax Season", "date": ["Posted Tue, 02/02/2016 - 16:08"], "release": "As Americans prepare for tax season, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Chairman of the Aging Committee, and Patty Murray (D-WA), the Ranking Member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today introduced the Save Access to a Valuable Investment Needed to Generate Savings (SAVINGS) Act of 2016. Original co-sponsors of the bill include Senators Angus King (I-ME), Jerry Moran (R-KS), and Claire McCaskill (D-MO). The bipartisan bill would preserve the Tax Time Savings Bond program, which provides taxpayers the option to receive IRS returns in the form of a paper U.S. Savings Bond. This program provides an important savings opportunity, particularly for consumers without a checking account, a savings account, or other type of banking product. Without action, the Tax Time Savings Bond program is set to expire after the 2016 tax season. \u201cU.S. Savings Bonds are an important, low-risk investment option for many individuals,\u201d  .\u00a0\u201cAt a time when many are not saving enough, if at all, preserving Americans\u2019 ability to receive paper bonds through their tax returns will help individuals, particularly those without bank accounts or Internet access, set aside necessary funds for future expenses.\u201d \u201cFor many years, paper U.S. Savings Bonds have given Americans across the country a trusted way to save and responsibly manage their money, which is why it makes no sense for Congress to allow the Tax Time Savings Bond program to expire at the end of this tax season,\u201d   \u201cIn a rural state like Maine where access to the Internet can be unreliable or people may lack access to traditional banking accounts, this program can be a vital savings opportunity. We should work to preserve that option, not diminish it.\u201d The Treasury Department had planned to discontinue the program after the 2015 tax season, but decided to extend the program through the 2016 tax season. The SAVINGS Act would require the U.S. Treasury Department to continue to provide an option on the IRS tax form for consumers to use some or all of their tax return to purchase a U.S. Savings Bond in paper form, for either themselves or a designated recipient. The bill would preserve an important savings opportunity during tax season U.S. Savings Bonds have played an important role in our history and culture \u2013 from the Series E bonds that helped finance World War II to the savings bonds grandparents purchase today as a gift to a new grandchild. Savings bonds are an important investment tool that provide a risk-free, no-fee, low penalty, and inflation-protected asset to the bond holder. As the financial world becomes increasingly digital and complex, the paper savings bond is an important financial learning tool, as it can be physically held and the terms easily understood. In 2012, the Treasury Department discontinued selling paper savings bonds at financial institutions. Now, U.S. Savings Bonds can be purchased online through Treasury Direct and are held in an online account. The only way to get a paper savings bond is through the Tax Time Savings Bond option for IRS returns \u2013 consumers check a box on the IRS refund allocation form (Form 8888), and some or all of their tax refund is returned as a paper savings bond. Treasury extends the Tax Time Savings Bond program on an annual basis. It was set to expire after the 2015 tax season but Treasury has decided to extend the program through the 2016 tax season. The FDIC reports that 7.7 percent of Americans are considered unbanked consumers, meaning they have rarely, if ever, held a checking account, a savings account, or other type of banking product. Of the lowest income households, roughly half do not have computer-based internet access. Of all households, less than half directly or indirectly hold stock in publically traded companies. All Americans should be able to invest in U.S. Savings Bonds, but this accessible savings option is especially important for low-income individuals and families who do not have access to our modern financial system. The Treasury Department should preserve the Tax Time Savings Bond program because the tax return is one of the best opportunities for households to save during the year. The average refund for low income Americans is $1,680 \u2013 often the largest one-time cash income for the year. This return can be used to buy a paper savings bond at face value, starting as small as $50. If needed, a savings bond can be redeemed after 12 months, with a low penalty up to five years (forgoing the last three months of interest accrual), and no penalty from five years to maturity of 30 years. Savings bonds also earn a higher rate of return than checking and savings account and are adjusted for inflation, without any of the associated banking fees. For consumers who are not yet ready for a retirement account that carries high penalties for early withdrawal but who want a better return than a savings account, the U.S. Savings bond is the best alternative. The Tax Time Savings Bond Program has been utilized by about 142,000 tax filers buying nearly $72.5 million in savings bonds from 2010-2013, and 25% of 2010 purchasers were repeat customers in 2011 and 2012.  would require the U.S. Treasury Department to continue to provide an option on the IRS tax form for consumers to use some or all of their tax return to purchase a U.S. Savings Bond in paper form, for either themselves or a designated recipient. This option will remain in place until the U.S. Treasury establishes a suitable alternative that serves the unbanked and individuals who lack internet access."},

This amendment echoes the principles outlined in   Senator Collins sent to the Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Agriculture, which was signed by 46 Senators, including Senator King. The amendment is supported by the National Alliance of Forest Owners, the American Forest and Paper Association, and the American Wood Council. In November 2014, one hundred nationally recognized forest scientists, representing 80 universities,  . This group weighed a comprehensive synthesis of the best peer-reviewed science and affirmed the carbon benefits of biomass. \u201cBiomass energy is sustainable, responsible, renewable, and economically significant as an energy source, and many states, including Maine, are already relying on biomass to meet their renewable energy goals,\u201d   \u201cWhile the carbon neutrality of biomass harvested from sustainably managed forests has been recognized repeatedly by numerous studies, agencies, institutions, and rules around the world, current policy uncertainty could end up jeopardizing rather than encouraging investments in working forests, harvesting operations, bioenergy, wood products, and paper manufacturing. Our tripartisan amendment would help ensure that federal policies for the use of renewable biomass are clear, simple, and reflect the importance of biomass for our energy future.\u201d \u201cNot only is forest biomass a home-grown and environmentally-responsible source of energy, but it can also be a significant boon to rural economies in Maine and across the country,\u201d   \u201cThat's why it's time that the federal government recognizes the environmental and economic benefits of this renewable resource. By requiring every federal department to be on the same page when it comes to biomass policy, our amendment will ensure that biomass will play an important role in shaping a clean and affordable energy future for America.\u201d \u201cSenators Collins and King know the importance of biomass energy production to our struggling rural economy in Maine, as well as the importance of good science. Maine has been in the forest biomass energy business for decades and our forests are certified as sustainably managed,\u201d   \u201cMaine\u2019s sawmills and paper mills also depend on using wood waste as fuel in biomass operations. Our carbon footprint is light, based on solid research and decades of carbon cycling. We thank our senators for clearing the way for this important national policy.\u201d \u201cBiomass has been recognized by the President as a clean, renewable fuel,\u201d  . \u201cWith the leadership of Senator Collins and Senator King, this amendment will ensure consistency as well as the further recognition of the President\u2019s goals and biomass\u2019 place in our energy mix. As Maine\u2019s biomass market is in a state of flux, this action by Maine\u2019s Senate leadership is vital for Maine\u2019s loggers and healthy forests across the country.\u201d \"Forest owners deeply appreciate the leadership of Senators Collins, King and Klobuchar, to emphasize the carbon benefits of biomass energy as part of our nation's renewable energy solution,\"  \"This amendment reflects the bipartisan support of 46 Senators who joined a June 2015 letter to the Administration affirming the carbon neutrality of forest biomass.\u00a0 It will help drive a consistent federal policy across all departments and agencies based on well-established science and agency expertise.\" \u201cThe amendment offered by Sens.

We applaud the Senators for their efforts with this important amendment.\u201d Specifically, the amendment would require the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to jointly ensure that federal policy relating to forest bioenergy is consistent across all departments and agencies and that the full benefits of forest biomass for energy, conservation, and responsible forest management are recognized.\u00a0 The amendment would also direct these federal agencies to establish clear and simple policies for the utilization of biomass as an energy solution.\u00a0 \u00b7\u00a0Reflect the carbon neutrality of forest bioenergy; \u00b7\u00a0Recognize forest biomass as a renewable energy source; \u00b7\u00a0Encourage private investment throughout the forest biomass supply chain; \u00b7\u00a0Encourage forest management to improve forest health; \u00b7\u00a0And recognize state initiatives to use forest biomass."},
{"title": "Regulatory Reform: Unleashing Our Nation\u2019s Job Creators", "date": ["Posted Thu, 02/04/2016 - 00:00"], "release": "When I ask employers in Maine what Washington needs to do to help them add jobs, they tell me this: reduce the cost and complexity of the federal regulations imposed on them.\u00a0 And this is not just a concern voiced by Maine businesses. \u00a0Earlier this year, a poll of small business owners across the country found that the vast majority aren\u2019t hiring new workers right now, and more than six in ten pointed to government regulations as the reason why.\u00a0 This is consistent with findings by the National Federation of Independent Business that new regulations cost small businesses an average of $12,000 per employee annually.\u00a0 This excessive burden on our nation\u2019s job creators helps explain the tepid job growth we have seen in recent years. No business owner I know questions the legitimate role of regulation in protecting the health, safety, and well-being of employees and the public.\u00a0 But the public is not well-served by regulations that bury small businesses under a mountain of paperwork, driving up costs unnecessarily, and impeding growth and job creation.\u00a0 Proper regulation should be as efficient and simple as possible.\u00a0 At the very least, the benefits of a regulation should exceed its costs. Unfortunately, the burden of federal regulations continues to grow.\u00a0 Right now, federal agencies are at work on nearly 2,500 new rules, at least 190 of which affect small businesses.\u00a0 Of these rules, 149 are major rules, costing more than $100 million each.\u00a0 These rules will go on top of a pile of regulations now measured in the millions of pages. Year-by-year, this pile of pages gets ever deeper.\u00a0 In the 1970s, the  , the compilation of federal regulations, added some 450,000 pages.\u00a0 In the first decade of the 21st Century, more than 730,000 pages were added \u2013 a rate of 73,000 pages per year.\u00a0 And the pace continues to accelerate.\u00a0 On average since 2010, the federal government has added 80,000 pages to the   each year.\u00a0 This cannot continue. We are now in the seventh year of an economic recovery that has produced such weak economic growth that most Americans still believe we are in a recession.\u00a0 The red-tape that is strangling our job creators is one of the reasons our economy has not rebounded as it did from prior recessions, and why millions of working-age Americans are not part of the labor force.\u00a0 If we want to get our economy back on track and rebuild the American workforce, Washington must get serious about streamlining and reforming our regulatory system. In the Senate, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has jurisdiction over legislation to reform our regulatory system.\u00a0 As a past-Chairman and Ranking Member of that Committee, I know how difficult, but essential, it is to reach consensus on how to improve our regulatory system. \u00a0Other than comprehensive tax refom, there are few actions Washington could take that would do more to strengthen our economy than to make sure that federal regulations achieve their intended goals without imposing unnecessary costs. The Committee is currently putting together a bipartisan regulatory reform package that I am cosponsoring.\u00a0 This legislation contains common-sense provisions that help provide needed certainty, consistency, and accountability in the regulatory process. These provisions include establishing a legislative commission to examine and recommend to Congress federal rules that should be consolidated, improved, or repealed.\u00a0 The bill would allow the President to require independent agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, to consider the cost as well as the benefits of \u201cmajor rules\u201d \u2013 rules that cost the economy $100 million or more \u2013 before they adopt these rules, just as regular executive branch agencies must do.\u00a0 It would require federal agencies to notify the public three months before issuing new rules, to clearly state how they will measure the success or failure of new rules, and to prohibit them from using unofficial \u201cguidance\u201d documents to side-step these notification requirements. In recent years, members of Congress from both parties and the President have offered regulatory reform proposals with little progress.\u00a0 In light of our persistently sluggish economy, I am hopeful that the Senate will move forward with regulatory reform this year.\u00a0 America\u2019s job creators and hard-working people have waited long enough."},
{"title": "Collins, King, Pingree, Poliquin Urge Secretary of Veterans Affairs to Fix Choice Program, Ensure Maine Veterans Receive Timely Care", "date": ["Posted Fri, 02/05/2016 - 15:55"], "release": " \u2013 Today, U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King and Representatives Chellie Pingree and Bruce Poliquin sent a letter to Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) Robert McDonald urging him to take immediate action to improve the implementation of the Choice Program and ensure that all veterans in Maine receive timely care. On January 28, 2016, representatives from the offices of Senators Collins and King and Representatives Pingree and Poliquin participated in a roundtable discussion on the implementation of the Choice Program, which was created to allow veterans to receive care within their communities instead of waiting for a VA appointment or traveling to a VA facility. However, as discussion participants indicated, the implementation of the program in Maine has been deeply flawed, leading to more than half of eligible veterans not receiving the care they need and deserve. As a result, the Maine Congressional Delegation today urged Secretary McDonald to take the following immediate actions: The complete text of the letter can be read below and  . February 5, 2016 The Honorable Robert McDonald Secretary of Veterans Affairs U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 810 Vermont Avenue Washington, D.C. 20420 Dear Secretary McDonald: Our staff recently participated in a roundtable discussion on the implementation of the Choice Program in Maine along with representatives from the Veterans Affairs Maine Healthcare System, Health Net Federal Services, Veterans Service Organizations, and community care providers.\u00a0 Based on that meeting, as well as additional feedback from Maine constituents, we firmly believe that implementation of the Choice Program in our state remains deeply flawed.\u00a0 According to the VA, only 48 percent of eligible Choice Program patients have received the appointments they need and have requested.\u00a0 This is entirely unacceptable and must be addressed. We are deeply concerned about communication gaps between Health Net Federal Services and community care providers, the VA, and veterans.\u00a0 Our offices have received numerous complaints from veterans and providers that they are unable to contact Health Net to schedule appointments or to resolve payment issues.\u00a0 Furthermore, even when veterans are able to connect with Health Net, referrals are not always timely or within a reasonable geographic distance to receive care, as those on the other end of the line are often thousands of miles away and lack understanding of Maine\u2019s geography. To address these problems, we urge the VA to work with Health Net to hire personnel in Maine to work with the Maine VA Health Care System to strengthen Health Net\u2019s provider network based on existing and projected need.\u00a0 This could help ensure that veterans have timely access to providers who are located near where they live.\u00a0 A Health Net representative in Maine could also educate providers about the program to prevent future payment and referral errors.\u00a0 In addition, our offices must have a local point of contact at Health Net in order to assist our constituents when they seek help. We also request that the VA provide its state medical centers, including the Maine VA Health Care System, the necessary flexibility and authority to continue using traditional non-VA community care programs to refer patients into the community.\u00a0 Veterans should not be forced to endure reduced quality of services as Health Net and the VA work to improve the Choice Program.\u00a0 As the VA and the leadership of Health Net identify ways to address these issues, please advise us of your plans to improve coordination and communication, including any recommendations that may require Congressional action.\u00a0 In addition, we would like to invite Dr. David Shulkin, Under Secretary of Health for the Department of Veterans Affairs, to Maine to review the Choice Program and discuss steps forward. The persistent problems of the Choice Program have only reinforced the value of the Access Received Closer to Home, or ARCH, program in ensuring our veterans in rural areas receive the high quality and timely care they deserve.\u00a0 The authority for that program is scheduled to sunset in August 2016, which would have a dramatic effect on veterans in Maine.\u00a0 We urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to continue ARCH and incorporate the lessons learned from that program into the VA\u2019s larger community care model.\u00a0 We will continue to work to extend ARCH\u2019s statutory authority. Thank you for your attention to these issues.\u00a0 We look forward to your response and to working with you to improve the Choice Program to ensure that our veterans receive the care they deserve.\u00a0 If you have questions regarding this matter, please contact us directly or have your staff contact our staff: Margaret Williams from Senator King\u2019s office at (202) 224-5344, Michele Pearce from Senator Collins\u2019 office at (202) 224-2523, Kathryn Renz from Congressman Poliquin\u2019s office at (202) 225-6306, or Joe Marro from Congresswoman Pingree\u2019s office at (202) 225-6116. ###"},

According to the CDC, health care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for painkillers in 2012, enough for every American adult to have a bottle of pills. \u201cSuch an ample supply of prescription opioids is subject to misuse and diversion, which has become one of the foremost public health challenges facing our nation,\u201d   \u201cFor millions of patients who are suffering from illness or injury, prompt delivery of pain control \u2013 which may or may not include opioid pain relievers \u2013 is proper and humane Yet inappropriate use of opioid pain relievers does not provide any clinical benefit and may actually pose a risk of harm.\u00a0 The evidence suggests that physicians may feel compelled to prescribe opioid pain relievers in order to improve hospital performance on quality measures.\u201d At present, a portion of Medicare funding is tied to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) assessment of the quality of care provided at hospitals across our country, which is based in part on a survey that discharged patients complete regarding their experience of care.\u00a0 This survey asks discharged patients to respond to questions including, \u201cDuring this hospital stay, how often was your pain well-controlled?\u201d and \u201cDuring this hospital stay, how often did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you with your pain?\u201d  \u201cthat the current evaluation system may inappropriately penalize hospitals and pressure physicians who, in the exercise of medical judgment, opt to limit opioid pain relievers to certain patients and instead reward those who prescribe opioids more frequently.

The Honorable Sylvia Mathews Burwell Secretary of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Avenue, S.W. Washington, D.C. 20201 Dear Madam Secretary:\u00a0 The prescription drug abuse epidemic is a nationwide and growing crisis that continues to have devastating effects on families across America and on public health and safety.\u00a0 In many states, it has also become a heroin crisis, overwhelming our communities and families with often tragic consequences.\u00a0 Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that deaths from opioid pain relievers as a result of misuse and abuse have soared over the last fifteen years. \u00a0 Moreover, the CDC reports that healthcare providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for painkillers in 2012, enough for every American adult to have a bottle of pills. \u00a0 It is alarming that Americans consume opioids at a greater rate than any other nation, including twice as many opioids per capita as Canada. \u00a0 Such an ample supply of prescription opioids is subject to misuse and diversion, which has become one of the foremost public health challenges facing our nation. The evolving scope of this crisis leads us to write you about one factor that may be contributing to these staggering statistics.\u00a0 As you know, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) operates the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program, an important part of our efforts to transition Medicare from a program that rewards providers for the volume of services provided to one that rewards high quality care.\u00a0 Under the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program, CMS will withhold 1.75 percent of participating hospitals\u2019 base operating diagnosis-related group payments in fiscal year 2016 and redistribute those funds to hospitals in accordance with their performance on certain quality measures.\u00a0 One quarter of this adjustment is based on the patient experience of care, which CMS measures according to the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey.\u00a0 This survey asks discharged patients to respond to questions including, \u201cDuring this hospital stay, how often was your pain well-controlled?\u201d and \u201cDuring this hospital stay, how often did the hospital staff do everything they could to help you with your pain?\u201d Pain control is a critical component of quality inpatient care.\u00a0 Patients can often be expected to experience pain, as pain is naturally associated with many events that may necessitate an inpatient stay, like acute surgery or trauma.\u00a0 Moreover, for many years, patients faced many barriers to accessing effective pain treatment because pain management was unfortunately ignored and often needlessly less than optimal.\u00a0\u00a0 The pendulum, however, may have swung too far.\u00a0 For millions of patients who are suffering from illness or injury, prompt delivery of pain control \u2013 which may or may not include opioid pain relievers \u2013 is proper and humane.\u00a0 Yet inappropriate use of opioid pain relievers does not provide any clinical benefit and may actually pose a risk of harm.\u00a0 The evidence suggests that physicians may feel compelled to prescribe opioid pain relievers in order to improve hospital performance on quality measures. As we take steps to reward high quality care in the Medicare program, it is critical that we correctly measure the quality we are rewarding.\u00a0 Currently, there is no objective diagnostic method that can validate or quantify pain.\u00a0 Development of such a measure would surely be a worthwhile endeavor.\u00a0 In the meantime, however, we are concerned that the current evaluation system may inappropriately penalize hospitals and pressure physicians who, in the exercise of medical judgment, opt to limit opioid pain relievers to certain patients and instead reward those who prescribe opioids more frequently.\u00a0 We understand that HHS has begun an examination of whether there is a connection between these measurements and potentially inappropriate prescribing patterns, and whether the survey should be modified to address this concern.\u00a0 We hope this is a robust examination of this issue and includes more input from hospitals and providers, many of whom have expressed concern to us about the survey\u2019s impact on opioid prescribing practices.\u00a0 We ask that you apprise us of the results of this examination when it is complete.

The traffickers deceive seniors with promises of prizes or relationships, setting them up to unknowingly try to carry luggage filled with cocaine or other items through customs, hoping they will not arouse suspicions. Such cases have been seen in nearly a dozen foreign countries, officials say. Details of the smuggling and a counteroperation that officials called Operation Cocoon were disclosed by the Department of Homeland Security during a hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Special Committee on Aging. Officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Customs and Border Protection agency are working with international law enforcement agencies to combat the growing deception, officials said. The Homeland Security investigation into drug smuggling that targeted older people began in 2013. Alan Scott Brown, the acting assistant director for investigative programs at Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the agency had managed to save some seniors \u2014 including a 97-year-old man \u2014 from becoming drug couriers by stopping them before they could leave the country.\u00a0\u00a0 But he added that some of the people, after years or months of prodding, were so trusting of members of the drug gangs that \u201cthey don\u2019t believe the truth when confronted.\u201d The two agencies say they have worked with foreign counterparts to intercept couriers, seizing a total of 272 kilograms of methamphetamine, 209 kilograms of cocaine, four kilograms of ecstasy and 11 kilograms of heroin. About 116 unsuspecting seniors \u2014 the oldest person taken into custody was 87 \u2014 have been arrested by foreign governments in smuggling cases, including in New Zealand, Australia, Brazil, India, Fiji and Japan. Eighty-three United States citizens have been arrested abroad since 2013 and identified by Immigration and Customs Enforcement as victims of this scheme through Operation Cocoon. \u201cThe criminals who set this chain of events into motion are cruel, but very, very clever,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who is the chairwoman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging J. Bryon Martin, 77, a retired pastor from Maine, is one of many American seniors serving time in a foreign prison after being accused of drug smuggling.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Andrew Martin, his son, testified at the hearing that his father was arrested in July after being caught at an airport in Madrid with nearly two kilograms of cocaine worth about $450,000. The elder Mr. Martin had met a person online who he thought was a young woman named \u201cJoy\u201d and struck up a relationship that lasted for five years, his son said.\u00a0 \u00a0 She claimed to be from a wealthy North African family and said she needed Mr. Martin\u2019s help in obtaining real estate documents for property her family owned in Peru. The woman asked him to go to South America to get the documents and then bring them to her in London. While in Peru, Mr. Martin was given two sealed packages and a plane ticket to London with a layover in Madrid. He was arrested after security personnel at the airport in Spain noticed the packages and opened them. Mr. Martin, who his son said was in poor health, is serving a six-year sentence for drug smuggling. \u201cBefore this conviction, my dad had never been charged with even a misdemeanor,\u201d Andrew Martin said. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Officials say they do not know precisely how many older adults have been deceived into becoming drug couriers. They say it is also very hard to catch the criminals behind the deception, because most operate outside the United States and have become highly sophisticated in disguising their activities"},

Systemic changes must be made to ensure that sexual abuse is identified and perpetrators held accountable.\u00a0 While the vast majority of UN peacekeepers serve with honor, sexual exploitation and abuse by any peacekeeper violates the solemn responsibility to protect innocent civilians.\u00a0 As the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, the United States has an obligation and responsibility to insist upon immediate and significant reforms.\u00a0 We appreciated Ambassador Power\u2019s testimony at the December 9, 2015 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that you are \u201cworking to ensure a higher standard of performance and conduct once peacekeeping contingents are deployed, specifically in two critical areas: the complete fulfillment of their mandates, and the combatting of sexual exploitation and abuse.\u201d\u00a0 We also agree sexual exploitation and abuse \u201cis especially abhorrent when committed by those who take advantage of the trust that communities are placing in the United Nations, and those responsible must be held accountable.\u201d Unfortunately, since that testimony, an independent report on December 15 revealed that at least thirteen soldiers from France, two from Equatorial Guinea, and three from Chad participated in alleged abuse of children between December 2013 and June 2014.\u00a0 In January and February there have been multiple new allegations regarding UN peacekeepers from MINUSCA at the M\u2019poko displaced persons camp and near the Banbari airport. \u00a0There are also fresh allegations against peacekeepers associated with missions that predate MINUSCA.\u00a0 Just as the United States has a leadership role supporting peacekeeping, we must take a leadership role holding abusers accountable and excising this disturbing phenomenon, which Secretary General Ban has called a \u201ccancer,\u201d from the UN system.\u00a0 We respectfully request that you provide the following information so that we may work with you to implement a more rigorous process to stop the abuse: Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

The project seeks to tie conservation successes with valuable outcomes for private landowners, such as maintaining forests, increasing the productivity and flow of goods in working forests and local economies, and protecting important ecological spaces.\u00a0 The project will be regional in scope, but will be piloted in a smaller geographic area so that successful results can be replicated regionally moving forward. This investment comes through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program, which is administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), a sub-agency of USDA. In November, the Senators   with Congressman Poliquin to NRCS Chief Jason Weller urging the service to support this project. NRCS is also investing $5.2 million in a regional project led by the Wildlife Management Institute, the Young Forest Initiative for At-Risk Species, that will help increase technical and financial assistance to certain non-industrial private forestland owners in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont."},

The fighting fraud resource guide documents all of the calls the Fraud Hotline received in 2015 and categorizes the 10 most common scams.\u00a0 The guide describes each of the top 10 frauds in extensive detail, includes multiple case studies to provide tangible examples of these scams, and provides advice from consumer protection agencies on ways to identify con artists\u2019 schemes.  In all of these scams, criminals use countless dastardly tricks that are as malevolent as they are innovative.\u00a0 Scam artists often pray on seniors\u2019 emotions to carry out their schemes.\u00a0 For instance, the crooks may inspire fear by impersonating a law enforcement official and threatening adverse actions if a senior refuses to send them money, or they may pretend to befriend a lonely senior online and convince the victim to send them hundreds or even thousands of dollars.

Each school day, more than 30 million students participate in the National School Lunch Program, and more than 12 million students are served school breakfast. \u00a0The food served to these children has a demonstrable effect on their health and well-being.\u00a0 Healthy and nutritious food increases students\u2019 ability to focus on their studies and improves their long-term health. Nationwide, schools are working to serve healthier meals, but they must have the right tools in order to do so.\u00a0 Unfortunately, many schools, particularly those that were built decades ago, lack the infrastructure necessary to prepare meals that are rich in fresh ingredients and must rely on workarounds that are expensive, inefficient, and unsustainable.\u00a0 In Maine, 99 percent of school districts need at least one piece of equipment, and nearly half of school districts need kitchen infrastructure upgrades, including more physical space, electrical capacity, and plumbing capacity.\u00a0 It is estimated that, overall, Maine schools would need more than $58 million to make necessary upgrades, which far exceeds the $112,000 in grants that the U.S. Department of Agriculture awarded Maine during the last two fiscal years for new equipment.\u00a0 To help solve this problem, I joined my colleague Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota in introducing the School Food Modernization Act.\u00a0 Under our bipartisan legislation, school administrators or other eligible borrowers could obtain federal guarantees for 80 percent of the loan value needed to construct, remodel, or expand school kitchens, dining, or food storage infrastructure. \u00a0Targeted grant assistance would help give school administrators and food service directors the funding needed to upgrade kitchen infrastructure or purchase kitchen equipment such as commercial ovens, steamers, and stoves. \u00a0The bill would also strengthen training and technical assistance to help school food service personnel meet nutrition standards. The School Food Modernization Act has been endorsed by numerous organizations, including the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the National PTA, and the Pew Charitable Trusts, among others.\u00a0 Recently, the Senate Agriculture Committee passed our legislation as part of the five-year reauthorization of child nutrition programs.\u00a0 This legislation, the Improving Child Nutrition Integrity and Access Act of 2016, must now be considered by the full Senate. I am very pleased that our bill to help assist schools in providing healthier meals to students throughout the country advanced in the Senate.\u00a0 The School Food Modernization Act will have a lasting, positive impact on students\u2019 health as well as their academic success.\u00a0 I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this bipartisan legislation becomes law."},

To read the full   interview with Senator Collins, click  .\u00a0 The full story is also pasted below: By Rodney Brooks January 22, 2016 Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) has served in the Senate since 1997 and has chaired the Senate Special Committee on Aging since last January. In that role, she has held multiple hearings on scams aimed at seniors and retirees. We spoke about those scams \u2014 the new ones and the old ones. This has been edited for clarity and length. We\u2019re continuing to investigate scams that are targeting seniors and our retirees. We established a toll-free fraud hotline [1-855-303-9470]. It received an astonishing 1,100 calls last year from all 50 states. Sometimes there are calls from seniors asking us about scams that they have been approached with and ask what they should do. Other times it is calls from seniors alerting us that there are new scams out there. Other times there are calls from seniors telling us how they have lost thousands of dollars as a result of scams. We try to help them by connecting them to local law enforcement or the [Federal Trade Commission]. In one case, we were able to act quickly enough that we were able to get the bank to stop the money transfer. In another case, we were able to get law enforcement involved in time that they made arrests. In the case of one infamous scam, the Jamaica lottery scam, the most frequent one, the Department of Justice prosecuted a Jamaican and had him extradited. He got 20 years. The U.S. has had the Jamaican government crack down on these con artists operating from boiler rooms in Jamaica. One is the IRS imposter scam. That is especially prevalent this time of the year. Last year we received 387 calls on the IRS imposter scam. In that case, a con artist pretends that they are an IRS agent and falsely accuses seniors of owing back taxes and penalties and demands immediate payment through money orders or cards that are available at drugstores. What\u2019s really pernicious about these scams is the con artists have figured out how to get around caller ID and spoof the telephone number of the Treasury Department. If the phone rings in your house and you have caller ID, it will say the U.S. Treasury Department. People will pick up the phone and believe it is a legitimate call. It makes the National Do Not Call Registry a woefully inadequate means of protection. One is the computer technical support scam. A senior will receive a call from someone who pretends to be from Microsoft or Dell or some other computer company telling them that their computer has been infected with a virus and they need information in order to solve the problem. What they do is trick the consumer into giving them the codes. They walk them through the process. They get access to the consumer\u2019s computer. Then they do one of two things. They say we fixed the virus and you owe us. If the senior says we don\u2019t have that much money, they give them a senior citizen discount. In the other case, they will plant a virus that, if the senior is using online banking, can gain access to their passwords and their financial accounts and will try to steal money by impersonating the senior\u2019s computer. We held a hearing on that. Microsoft is working hard to try to fight that kind of scam and let people know they will not receive phone calls from Microsoft saying that you have a virus and demanding payment to fix it. That\u2019s a new one. We didn\u2019t know that one was out there until we started getting calls. That is a perennial one. I was almost a victim of this one a few years ago. In this case what happens is a senior will get an email that appears to be from a grandchild. In my case, it appeared to be from my nephew. It says the grandchild is overseas and has been robbed and lost all their money, airplane ticket home and passport. It is a sob story that sounds very authentic. It really sounded like it was from one of my nephews. Rather than wiring him money, which was the request, I told him to go to the American embassy and get help, including a new passport. Mine wasn\u2019t a very sympathetic reply. I started thinking about it and didn\u2019t think he was overseas and called his father. It was a very convincing email. And that scam has been going on for years. But it keeps appearing. One that is still popular is the home improvement scam. Then there\u2019s the romance scam, where a person develops a relationship by calling regularly and then asks for money to buy an airplane ticket to come see the person. That\u2019s sad because it\u2019s usually lonely seniors living alone that fall victim to those scams. The fact that we received more than 1,000 calls shows how valuable it is to publicize these scams. The more we can prevent people from falling victim to these scams, the better. My advice to seniors is that if they have any concerns about whether a call they get seeking money is legitimate, they should not send the money. And most of those calls are scams. If they have any concerns or questions, call our fraud hotline or their local police department. Or talk with their adult children or the AARP. Don\u2019t send money and find out later that you regret it. Secondly, if adult children who have access to their parent\u2019s checking accounts start seeing unusual withdrawals, they should ask questions. The state of Maine has a program called the Senior Safe program that trains bank tellers and credit union tellers to look for unusual withdrawals from seniors\u2019 accounts. We are trying to get through federal legislation that would do something similar on a national level. There\u2019s the old adage \u2014 if it sounds too good to be true, it probably isn\u2019t true. If you won a lottery that you haven\u2019t entered, beware."},

{"title": "Increasing Investment in Biomedical Research: A Bipartisan Opportunity ", "date": ["Posted Fri, 01/15/2016 - 15:11"], "release": "The people of Maine, and of this country, expect the President and Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle to work together to improve the lives of hardworking Americans. \u00a0The problems, both at home and abroad, are too important to be stymied by incivility, extremism, or hyper-partisanship. In his 2016 State of the Union address, President Obama called for our country to come together to tackle the challenges we face. \u00a0 I hope that the President will follow through on his call for cooperation and work in a bipartisan fashion, rather than resorting to executive orders that exacerbate political tensions and circumvent Congress. I was especially pleased by the President\u2019s support for increasing investment in biomedical research.\u00a0 This initiative has broad, bipartisan appeal and is an example of where we can work together to advance more effective treatments and even cures or a means of prevention for diseases that affect so many American families. Specifically, the President announced his support for a new national effort to find innovative treatments and, eventually, a cure for cancer.\u00a0 This builds upon Vice President Biden\u2019s call last year for a \u201cnew moonshot\u201d to defeat the disease following the tragic loss of his son, Beau, to brain cancer.\u00a0 In addition, President Obama urged Congress to fund an expanded effort to wipe out malaria, which remains a scourge throughout much of Africa. The \u201cmoonshot\u201d analogy is appropriate.\u00a0 On May 25, 1961, with our nation reeling from the Soviet Union\u2019s successes in space, President Kennedy gave a historic speech to a joint session of Congress in which he pledged that there would be Americans on the moon before the end of the decade.\u00a0 On July 20, 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made good on that pledge. Apollo 11 did more than plant the American flag on the moon and win the space race.\u00a0 The space program launched an era of technological advancements that is evident in everything from the weather satellites in orbit to the powerful smartphones in our pockets and purses. In much the same way, a concerted effort to defeat cancer would yield wide-ranging benefits.\u00a0 Cancer is not just one disease, but a broad category of disease with hundreds of manifestations requiring different treatments.\u00a0 New therapies that boost the immune system are giving some\u00a0leading cancer researchers optimism about the potential for breakthroughs. Biomedical research that unleashes the power of the immune system holds promise for many of the most costly and devastating diseases.\u00a0 As Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, one of my top priorities is increasing investment in biomedical research in order to combat diseases that disproportionately affect older Americans like Alzheimer's and diabetes. It is encouraging that Congress already is working together to increase these investments.\u00a0 I advocated strongly for the $2 billion increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health, the largest increase since 2003 and an investment that will pay dividends for patients and their families. As the Senate Co-Chair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, I am all too aware of the tremendous personal and economic toll this devastating disease takes on more than five million Americans and their families. \u00a0I co-authored the 2011 law creating the National Plan to Address Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and sponsored a resolution calling for Congress to devote at least $2 billion per year to research as recommended by the expert federal advisory council established by this law.\u00a0 Last year, Congress approved a $350 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s disease research at the National Institute of Aging, bringing the total amount available for Alzheimer\u2019s disease research to $936 million.\u00a0 This is an increase of more than 50 percent and almost half-way to our $2 billion a year goal.\u00a0 As this vital research proceeds, it is essential that we support the family caregivers who meet the daily needs of those afflicted with disease.\u00a0 Early this year, I toured the Stewart Adult Day Center in Falmouth, a wonderful facility that is run by the Southern Maine Area Agency on Aging and serves individuals suffering from Alzheimer's and other dementias. The colorful and appealing building was made possible by private donations and particularly the generosity of the Stewart family.\u00a0 The Center benefits those afflicted by preventing isolation that exacerbates the illness, and it serves as a resource for caregivers by providing much-needed respite care.\u00a0 Late last year, the Senate passed  \u00a0I introduced to develop a national strategy to recognize and support the more than 40 million family caregivers in the United States. \u00a0\u00a0The next step will be working hard to get RAISE through the House of Representatives in order to create that national strategy. When Apollo 11 Commander Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon 47 years ago, he famously said, \u201cThat\u2019s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201d\u00a0 With the unified support of the President and Congress for investments in biomedicine, the small steps taken in research laboratories throughout the country can produce a giant leap in mankind\u2019s fight against such terrible diseases as cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s."},

Biomass energy is sustainable, responsible, renewable, and economically significant as an energy source.\u00a0 Many states are already relying on biomass to meet their renewable energy goals.\u00a0 There is a great deal of support for renewable biomass, which creates the benefits of establishing jobs, boosting economic growth, and helping us to meet our nation\u2019s energy needs. Federal policies across all departments and agencies must remove any uncertainties and contradictions through a clear policy that forest bioenergy is part\u2014an essential part\u2014of our nation\u2019s energy future.\u00a0 With these goals in mind, I have offered a very straightforward amendment\u2014with a group of colleagues that spans the ideological spectrum.\u00a0 They include, as I mentioned, Senators Klobuchar and King, as well as Senators Ayotte, Franken, Daines, Crapo, and Risch.

Our amendment supports the key role that forests in the United States can play in addressing the nation\u2019s energy needs.\u00a0 The amendment echoes the principles outlined in the June 2015 letter that we sent, which was signed by 46 Senators.\u00a0 As the presiding officer knows, it\u2019s very unusual for 46 Senators on both sides of the aisle to come together in support of a policy. Specifically, our amendment would require the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to jointly ensure that federal policy relating to forest bioenergy is consistent across all departments and agencies and that the full benefits of forest biomass for energy, conservation, and responsible forest management are recognized. The amendment would also direct these federal agencies to establish clear and simple policies for the utilization of biomass as an energy solution.\u00a0 These include policies that\" The carbon neutrality of biomass harvested from sustainably managed forests has been recognized repeatedly by numerous studies, agencies, institutions, and rules around the world, and there has been no dispute about the carbon neutrality of biomass derived from the residuals of forest products manufacturing and agriculture. Our tripartisan amendment would help ensure that federal policies for the use of clean, renewable energy solutions are clear and simple.\u00a0 I am in conversations with the two managers of this important bill, the Chairman, Senator Murkowski, the Ranking Member, Senator Cantwell, about our amendment, and I hope that it will be adopted.\u00a0 I would encourage our colleagues to support its adoption. Mr. President, as I mentioned, Senators Klobuchar and King joined with me last week in introducing this bill.\u00a0 I would ask Unanimous Consent that Senator Ayotte, Senator Franken, Senator Daines, Senator Crapo, and Senator Risch be added to the amendment as well."},

{"title": "Senators Collins, King Announce Approval of $1 billion Toward Additional Destroyer Likely to be built at BIW ", "date": ["Posted Wed, 12/16/2015 - 13:20"], "release": " \u2013 U.S. Senators Susan Collins, a senior member of the Defense Appropriations Committee, and Angus King, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, announced today that the final omnibus bill includes $1 billion toward the construction of an additional DDG-51 destroyer. This destroyer would likely be built at Bath Iron Works. This destroyer would be in addition to those already included in the current multi-year procurement contract. The omnibus bill will be considered by Congress later this week. As a senior member of the Defense Appropriations Committee, Senator Collins requested the funding toward the additional DDG-51 to help meet combatant commander requirements for destroyers across the globe.\u00a0 Senator Collins successfully advocated for the inclusion of the $1 billion in funding in the Senate Defense Appropriations Bill. The House Defense Appropriations Bill, however, allocated no funding for this additional destroyer.\u00a0 Following weeks of negotiations between the House and Senate regarding the bill, the omnibus bill appropriates the full $1 billion in funding toward this additional ship, affirming the strategic importance of our Navy and shipbuilding programs. \u201cOur destroyers are the workhorses of the Navy, and I am proud of the highly skilled, hardworking men and women at Bath Iron Works who continue to deliver the highest quality ships for our nation\u2019s sailors,\u201d  . \u201cThe power of presence cannot be taken for granted or ignored, which is why the investments for this new destroyer funded by this bill are so necessary. In a time of serious budget constraints for our Defense Department, this important investment underscores the value and importance of our naval assets to the security and stability of our country.\u00a0 The equation is simple:\u00a0 fewer ships means less presence, less security at home, and less security around the world.\u00a0 I am so pleased that after many long hours of negotiations, this $1 billion in funding was included in the final omnibus bill.\u201d \u201cSenator Collins is a relentless advocate for the hardworking men and women at Bath Iron Works, and I am thankful that she was able to secure additional funding for shipbuilding through her position on the Appropriations Committee,\u201d   \u201cThe funding for this additional ship is a major achievement for Maine and she deserves all the credit. There is no one I\u2019d rather be working with on behalf of BIW, the State of Maine, and the men and women of our armed forces than Susan.\u201d Senators Collins and King work together in support of Bath Iron Works from their respective positions on the Appropriations and Armed Services Committees. As a member of Armed Services, Senator King works to ensure that critical shipbuilding funding is authorized through the  , a yearly bill that authorizes funding and directs policy for the Department of Defense. And as a senior member of Appropriations, Senator Collins works to make sure the authorized funds are then actually appropriated to shipbuilding priorities. Through this joint effort, the Senators are able to prioritize shipbuilding throughout the funding process.\u00a0 As of January 2015, the Navy had 279 ships, well short of the goal set by the Navy\u2019s 30-year shipbuilding plan which calls for the United States to have 304 ships by 2020. This investment will help to grow the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding capabilities at a time when the Navy fleet is in high demand to protect national security interests worldwide."},

This June, the Senate passed a   (TAA), which was based upon The Trade Adjustment Assistance Enhancement Act of 2015 that Senator Collins co-authored with Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR). TAA is a program of the Department of Labor that helps workers who have lost their jobs as a result of increased imports or a shift of production outside of the United States. TAA provides these trade-affected workers with a variety of reemployment services and benefits to help them find new jobs and get back to work. In the 2013 fiscal year alone, more than 700 Mainers used TAA programs, and more than 70 percent of those participants found employment within three months of completing their retraining programs. In addition, of the participants who found employment, more than 90 percent were still employed in their new jobs six months later."},

Senator Collins was selected to serve on the Conference Committee for the legislation, which worked to find compromise between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The Committee reported the final bill passed by the Senate today, which included two important provisions authored by Senator Collins: Senator Collins co-authored this program with Senator Kent Conrad in 2002. \u00a0REAP provides financial assistance to small and high-poverty rural districts to help address unique local needs and meet federal requirements. This program has been particularly helpful in Maine and has supported a variety of initiatives that benefit students and teachers, including: new technology in classrooms, distance learning opportunities, and professional development activities. This program would support states designing assessment systems based on student proficiency.\u00a0 In April, the HELP Committee unanimously adopted a bipartisan amendment authored by Senator Collins to improve this program, including allowing more states to participate in the program, and giving participating school districts more time to scale up their systems statewide. Several other provisions for which Senator Collins has advocated are also included in the bill, including support for quality after-school and summer programs through the 21st Century Community Learning Center program, the Ready-to-Learn program to promote early learning and school readiness, and for arts education programming for disadvantaged students and children with disabilities."},

{"title": "Investigating Sudden and Dramatic Price Increases of Off-Patent Drugs", "date": ["Posted Fri, 12/11/2015 - 00:00"], "release": "Prescription drugs are vital to the health and well-being of all Americans, especially our nation\u2019s seniors, 90 percent of whom take at least one prescription drug in any given month. \u00a0For many Americans, access to prescription drugs is not only critical to their quality of life, but can literally be a matter of life or death. Unfortunately, there have been several examples in recent months of certain pharmaceutical companies suddenly and dramatically increasing prices for off-patent prescription drugs they have acquired.\u00a0 The Senate Aging Committee, which I chair, launched a bipartisan investigation into these price spikes and recently held the first in a series of hearings on this topic.\u00a0 Although our investigation is still in its initial phases, the Committee has already interviewed dozens of patients, doctors, and health care experts from around the country and reviewed thousands of pages of documents to better understand the causes and effects of these egregious price increases. Four companies in particular have come to our attention and are the focus of our investigation thus far:\u00a0 Turing Pharmaceuticals, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Retrophin, Inc., and Rodelis Therapeutics.\u00a0 Each of these companies abruptly hiked the price of off-patent drugs they recently acquired by twenty, thirty, or even forty times the initial price, at times putting these medicines out of reach for patients and the doctors who treat them.\u00a0 Usually when the patent expires on a prescription drug, the cost goes down as generic versions are produced.\u00a0 In these cases, even though the patents had expired years ago, there were no generics, and the companies that bought the drugs sent their prices skyrocketing. In North Carolina, for example, doctors for a child diagnosed with toxoplasmosis were unable to obtain Daraprim,\u00a0the drug needed to treat that disease, because Turing Pharmaceuticals had hiked the price of the drug from $17.63 to $750 per pill, an increase of more than 4,000 percent. This sudden spike forced the local pharmacy to drop it from its inventory. \u00a0As a consequence, the child had to be treated with an alternative that had not been rigorously tested in children.\u00a0 Valeant, Retrophin, and Rodelis have imposed similarly outrageous price increases on off-patent drugs used to treat cardiac issues, serious kidney disease, and drug-resistant tuberculosis. If we want new medicines to reach consumers who need them, the companies that invest in the research and take the risks necessary to develop these drugs must see a fair return on their investment. \u00a0At the same time, we cannot be blind to the cost of these drugs to individuals, health systems, and the federal government.\u00a0 Americans are expected to spend more than $328 billion on prescription drugs this year alone. Of this amount, individuals will pay about $50 billion out-of-pocket.\u00a0 The federal government will pick up another $110 billion in payments through Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, and other programs, with state governments, insurers, other payors, and charity care responsible for the remainder of this vast sum. For many decades, federal policy has sought to strike the right balance between maintaining the incentives needed to promote innovation and the development of new drugs and keeping medicines affordable. \u00a0One way we have done so is by granting pharmaceutical companies exclusive rights through our patent system to sell the prescription drugs they develop for approximately 20 years. \u00a0When these patents expire, other companies can seek approval to enter the market to offer generic versions of these drugs.\u00a0 This increases competition and helps lower prices. That balance we have struck never anticipated companies acquiring off-patent drugs and then raising their prices to enormous heights, and doing so, as one executive essentially put it, \u201cbecause I can.\u201d \u00a0But that is exactly what we have seen in recent months.\u00a0 Some of these companies contend they need the revenue from higher prices to finance research into new therapies or improvements to existing drugs. \u00a0Research and development is both expensive and essential, but these particular companies did not conduct the research and development and clinical trials on the drugs they bought. \u00a0Others have said that their price hikes will be absorbed by insurance companies and will never be felt by \u201creal people.\u201d\u00a0 Of course, insurers ultimately pass on these costs to consumers by way of higher premiums, deductibles, and co-pays. Our investigation is not about the legitimate incentives to create and market new drugs. \u00a0Just recently, I met with a small pharmaceutical company that may be on the verge of a breakthrough for treating a neurological disease and is spending a billion dollars on clinical trials alone. \u00a0We do not want to stifle innovation for potentially lifesaving drugs. We do not, however, want a company to be able to take advantage of a monopoly situation where there is no competition and no downward pressure on prices.\u00a0 After the patent on a prescription drug expires, our system relies upon competition to bring more affordable generics to the marketplace. I find it disturbing, and indeed unconscionable, that a company would buy up a decades-old drug that it had no role in developing and then would hike up the price to such egregious levels that it is having an effect on patient care.\u00a0 Two goals of our bipartisan investigation are to understand why such companies can impose dramatic price hikes on off-patent drugs they have acquired, and what policies we should consider to counter this disturbing practice."},

This legislation will soon be considered by the Senate. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  have been included in the PATH Act, including a provision that would make small business expensing a permanent feature of the tax code at $500,000.\u00a0 Known as Section 179, it allows small businesses to deduct from their annual tax obligation up to $500,000 for the cost of new equipment, machinery, technology and other capital upgrades. If Congress fails to extend this provision, the maximum deduction amount will drop to $25,000. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 During the news conference  , \u201cVoting to make 179 permanent is one of the most crucial actions Congress can take in 2015 to help small business. It\u2019s a tax benefit that encourages small businesses to invest in their own growth, which every member of the Senate would agree the country needs. Making that provision permanent has been our top priority for years and we\u2019re very grateful to Majority Leader McConnell, Senator Johnson, and Senator Collins for their strong support.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In her remarks,   that when she \u201ctalks to small businesses in Maine, their number one complaint to me is that they never know what the tax code is going to be, and thus they tend to freeze their investment decisions, and therefore their job creation\u2026 the ramifications of having certainty and ending the unpredictability in our tax code for these three vital small business provisions will help to create many more new jobs for our economy.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  to underscore the importance of these provisions for our small businesses. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 According to the  , permanent small business expensing would increase economic output by almost $19 billion and create nearly 200,000 jobs over the next 10 years. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Back in April, I introduced a bill to extend section 179 expensing, to extend the bonus depreciation provision, and to extend an expired provision that allows restaurants and retailers to depreciate their improvements and equipment over 15 years rather than a very unrealistic 39 years. I\u2019m absolutely delighted that all three of these important provisions have been included in the tax bill that we will vote on tomorrow. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This will make a tremendous difference to small businesses, which create the majority of new jobs in this nation and are so important to communities across America. When I talk to small businesses in Maine, their number one complaint to me is that they never know what the tax code is going to be, and thus they tend to freeze their investment decisions, and therefore their job creation, until that becomes clear. And when it does not become clear until the final month of the year, they essentially lose the opportunity to make investments that otherwise would have occurred at the beginning of the year. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I remember talking to the owner of a precision machining shop in southern Maine who told me that when 179 expensing is in effect he knows that he will buy more equipment and that he will be able to hire more skilled workers. But when there is uncertainty about whether it will be put into effect retroactively, he loses that opportunity because the machinery he makes, that he buys requires a long lead time. Similarly, I have heard from Maine\u2019s wonderful craft beer industry, which makes the best beer in the United States, but also is a very labor and capital intensive industry. Well when these provisions like bonus depreciation and small business expensing are part of the tax code in a permanent way, they can plan their investments, and that helps not only these breweries, it also helps the entire supply chain, including the farmers in Aroostook County that are providing the malted barley and the hops that go into these beers. My point is, that the ramifications of having certainty and ending the unpredictability in our tax code for these three vital small business provisions will help to create many more new jobs for our economy."},

This epidemic is the result of a \u201cone-two punch.\u201d\u00a0 First, more than a decade ago, the increased use of prescription opiate painkillers for legitimate medical purposes led to a dramatic increase in the abuse of those medications and also in overdoses.\u00a0 Second, as medical and law enforcement officials took steps to make it more difficult to obtain prescription opioids illegally, the street price of those drugs soared and cheap, readily available heroin filled the void.\u00a0 A single recreational dose of a prescription painkiller can cost $40 or more on the street, while a single dose of heroin can be purchased for as little as $5. \u00a0Users often initially become addicted to the prescription drugs they wrongly consider safe and then, due to the cost of feeding a daily addiction, switch to the cheaper illegal heroin. The reason big-city traffickers are targeting northern New England is also a matter of economics.\u00a0 According to the Centers for Disease Control, Maine and New Hampshire have the dubious distinction of having the most prescriptions per person for long-acting and high-dose painkillers.\u00a0 Thus, our states have a high concentration of potential heroin customers. All too often, the road to addiction begins with a legitimate medical issue.\u00a0 Not long ago, a young man in Maine told me that he was prescribed an opioid painkiller after he was injured playing high school football.\u00a0 He began abusing prescription drugs in college, and that led to heroin.\u00a0 His is a tragic but common story. But perhaps most tragic is the effect of this epidemic on the most vulnerable in our society \u2013 the babies born to addicts.\u00a0 It is heartbreaking that nearly 1,000 babies suffering from addiction have been born in Maine already this year, a number which represents about eight percent of all births in our state.\u00a0 Nationwide, there has been a staggering 300 percent increase in the number of infants diagnosed with newborn withdrawal since 2000, and the cost of treatment for these newborns was more than $700 million in 2009. Researchers estimate that more than one baby every twenty-five minutes is now born dependent on drugs and suffering from withdrawal. In October, the Senate passed the Protecting Our Infants Acts, a bipartisan bill I sponsored that will help address the growing crisis of opioid use and abuse among pregnant women and its effect on newborn babies. This law will help some of our most vulnerable children\u00a0receive the best possible start in life. The doctors and other health care providers treating them do an extraordinary job of helping these infants, but clearly more needs to be done to prevent this problem from occurring in the first place. This legislation commissions a broad strategy to identify current gaps in prevention and treatment, improve coordination among federal programs, and help ensure that our public health system is best equipped to treat opioid addicted mothers and their babies in Maine and across our country. Early this month, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee held a hearing at my request on the heroin crisis and the abuse of prescription painkillers.\u00a0 The expert testimony and the keen interest shown by my colleagues from throughout the nation make it clear that this truly is an epidemic. The time for action is now.\u00a0 This crisis calls for a three-pronged approach: The first is prevention through education. We must better educate our young people so they know how dangerous prescription drugs, as well as heroin, can be.\u00a0 We need to educate patients that there may be safe and effective alternatives to strong and potentially addictive painkillers.\u00a0 And we need to do a better job of educating health care providers about those options. The second prong is law enforcement.\u00a0 Our law enforcement agencies need the resources to shut off the supply of heroin coming from international cartels, such as Mexican drug gangs. The third is treatment.\u00a0 I am distressed that we have seen the loss of treatment options, such as the closure last spring of Mercy Hospital\u2019s outpatient center, because of low reimbursement rates and a lack of funding for that important work.\u00a0 As a result of the shortage of treatment options, this epidemic is playing out in emergency rooms, county jails, and on Main Streets throughout the country.\u00a0\u00a0 Maine sheriffs tell me that their jails are overwhelmed by those struggling with addiction and that they cannot arrest their way out of this epidemic. Jails are not designed to take the place of treatment centers, yet sheriffs and police chiefs must train their officers to look for signs of withdrawal and monitor mental health status.\u00a0 I believe the federal government could assist in forging greater cooperation between law enforcement and treatment centers. I have asked the Administration to act on one particular issue immediately.\u00a0 Right now, primary care physicians are restricted on the number of patients they can treat with drugs that help wean people off of heroin.\u00a0 The cap of 30 initial patients, with the possibility of a waiver for 100, was arbitrarily set 15 years ago.\u00a0 Most of the witnesses at our hearing agreed with me that the cap should be eliminated altogether. This drug epidemic is a national crisis that has its greatest effect at the local level -- on our streets, in our homes, in our schools and communities \u2013 and that touches all lives, from infants to adults. It is encouraging that so many of my colleagues from across the country share my concern and are committed to finding solutions."},

This year, 5.2 million Americans, including 37,000 in Maine, will suffer from the devastating emotional and economic toll caused by Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The omnibus bill includes a $350 million dollar increase in funding to combat Alzheimer's disease for fiscal year 2016 bringing the total to $936 million. Senator Collins has long worked to increase funding for WAP, which plays an important role in permanently reducing home heating and electricity costs for low-income families and seniors through cost-effective energy efficiency home improvements. A total of $215 million for WAP is included in the omnibus, a $22 million increase.\u00a0 \u2014 This legislation includes all five of the major provisions included in Senator Collins\u2019 bipartisan  , which she introduced following the cyber-attack at the Office of Personnel Management earlier this year. These critically important provisions will help to protect our government systems and prevent future, potentially devastating cyber attacks against our nation. \u2014 Senator Collins has long advocated for increased funding for the development of offshore wind technology and successfully advocated to include language directing $7.4 million for \u201calternate projects designs,\u201d which directly benefits UMaine\u2019s innovative deepwater offshore wind project. The total amount provided for DOE\u2019s wind program is $95.5 million.\u00a0  The omnibus includes a provision authored by Senator Collins that would block the FDA\u2019s proposed E-labeling rule for prescribing information, which would be acutely felt by rural Americans.\u00a0 This provision will protect paper inserts that are important tools for our pharmacists and health care professionals in charge of administering life-saving medications to our hardworking families and seniors. $ The Omnibus provides $175.8 million for REAP, which supports rural schools and districts. As a senior member of the Senate HELP Committee, Senator Collins successfully secured an extension of the REAP program in the   which was signed into law on Dec. 10. \u2014Senator Collins advocated for a $60 million increase for the federal TRIO programs, which provide critical services that help first-generation, low-income student earn college degrees.\u00a0 This brings the total funding for TRIO to $900 million. \u2014As chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Collins secured $42.5 million to test comprehensive efforts to end youth homelessness, better track the number of homeless youth, and evaluate the effectiveness of current programs."},

{"title": "A Year in Review ", "date": ["Posted Mon, 01/04/2016 - 07:52"], "release": "As we turn the page on 2015 and look to the future, I welcome this opportunity to share some of the accomplishments of the past year.\u00a0 Although much work remains to be done, I was able to achieve progress on issues that matter to the people of Maine, whom I am honored to represent in the United States Senate. Growing the economy by encouraging the creation of more jobs was and remains my top priority.\u00a0 The tax-relief bill passed by Congress late last year contains three key provisions I authored to help provide small businesses \u2013 the engine of our economy \u2013 with the certainty they need to plan for expansion, invest in equipment, and, most important, to hire new workers. These tax provisions allow small businesses to immediately deduct the entire cost, up to $500,000 of certain newly acquired assets that are purchased or financed during the tax year, and to more quickly recover the costs of equipment that wear out, or depreciates, with use.\u00a0 One provision of particular importance to Maine\u2019s tourism sector enables restaurants to depreciate the cost of renovations over 15 years, rather than the previous, unreleastic 39 years. Maine\u2019s economy and traffic safety both got a boost with a permanent change in the federal law that previously had forced the heaviest trucks onto our country roads and downtown streets rather than allowing them to use Maine\u2019s federal Interstates.\u00a0 This permanent provision, which I included in the transportation provisions of the comprehensive funding bill, follows a successful pilot program I authored that has made Maine\u2019s secondary roads and downtown streets safer, saved Maine companies time and money, and reduced energy consumption and emissions. Maine\u2019s economic future took a step forward last year with a significant additional funding I helped to secure for the Offshore Wind Advanced Technology Demonstration initiative, which benefits the University of Maine\u2019s innovative deepwater offshore wind project. I am a strong advocate for this emerging alternative energy source that has the potential to create thousands of good jobs here in Maine and make our state the global leader in this promising new technology. The people of Maine are proud of the historic role our state has played in our nation\u2019s defense, and as a senior member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I work to ensure that these contributions continue.\u00a0 In 2015, I secured $1 billion toward an additional Naval destroyer, which likely would be built at Bath Iron Works. \u00a0America\u2019s combatant commanders have outlined military requirements for a considerably larger Navy than we now have, and destroyers remain the workhorses of the fleet.\u00a0 Modernization projects at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard I long have advocated for were completed.\u00a0 In addition, I helped to secured $7.2 million for the Maine Air National Guard\u2019s 101st Air Refueling Wing to renovate the base fire and crash rescue station and celebrated the opening of the $14.5 million Maine Army National Guard Readiness Center in Bangor on December 5th.\u00a0 Victory over bureaucratic intransigence was finally achieved last year when the wholesome fresh potato was finally included in the federal nutrition program known as WIC.\u00a0 As directed in a law I wrote, the Institute of Medicine evaluated the nutritional value of potatoes, finding them to be a good source of vitamins, fiber, and potassium and further finding that there was no justification for the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to exclude this vegetable.\u00a0 The Department finally relented and now includes whole potatoes, which had been the only fresh vegetable or fruit excluded from the WIC program.\u00a0 I also secured funding and language on a range of issues important to Maine's farmers and growers, including potatoes, wild blueberries, and pollinating bees. At the beginning of 2015, I became Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, a position I sought for two reasons:\u00a0 Maine has the highest median age of any state, and the issues facing our nation due to its changing demographics as our population ages deserve more attention. \u00a0The priorities we focused on were retirement security, fraud and financial abuses of our seniors, and the need for investing more funding in biomedical research, particularly for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and diabetes.\u00a0 \u00a0 I advocated strongly for the $2 billion increase in funding approved for the National Institutes of Health, which is the largest increase to the agency\u2019s budget since 2003. This is an investment that will pay dividends, particularly when dealing with costly diseases like diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s.\u00a0 As the Senate Co-Chair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, I am all too aware of the tremendous personal and economic toll this devastating disease takes on more than five million Americans and their families. \u00a0I co-authored the 2011 law creating the National Plan to Address Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and sponsored a resolution calling for Congress to devote at least $2 billion per year to research as recommended by the expert federal advisory council established by this law.\u00a0 Last year, Congress approved a $350 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s disease research at the National Institute of Aging, bringing the total amount available for Alzheimer\u2019s disease research to $936 million \u2013 a more than 50 percent increase and almost half-way to that $2 billion a year goal.\u00a0 As America ages, the need for care and support increases too.\u00a0 There are more than 40 million individuals in our nation who know all too well the compassion, commitment, and endurance that it takes to be a caregiver of a loved one. \u00a0Family caregivers devote their time and attention, and they frequently must make many personal and financial sacrifices to enable many of our nation\u2019s seniors to remain living in the safety and comfort of their own homes.\u00a0 I am pleased that the Senate last year passed the Raise Family Caregivers Act I introduced with Senator Tammy Baldwin to develop a national strategy to recognize and support family caregivers in the United States The Aging Committee also continued to focus on the scams and frauds targeting our seniors.\u00a0 Our toll-free hotline (1-855-303-9470) makes it easier for senior citizens to report suspected fraud and receive assistance and has received more than a thousand calls. Serving on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I was deeply involved in reforming the flawed No Child Left Behind Act as Congress passed the most significant education legislation in many years.\u00a0 The new law recognizes that we don\u2019t need a national school board at the Department of Education and empowers states and communities to make important education decisions.\u00a0 The education reform act also includes an extension of the Rural Education Achievement Program I co-authored that provides additional financial assistance to rural schools and districts. At least 120 Maine school districts have collectively received more than $4 million for the REAP program The $250 above-the-line deduction I authored in 2002 for teachers who spend their own money on classroom supplies, which has been extended several times, was made permanent last year. As Chairman of the Senate Transportation and Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, I have made combating veterans\u2019 homelessness a priority.\u00a0 This year\u2019s housing funding bill includes $60 million for 8,000 new supportive housing vouchers for homeless veterans.\u00a0 Since this program began in 2008, the number of homeless veterans nationwide has dropped by one third. Maine has received nearly 200 vouchers to support homeless veterans. A Maine value that always guides me is our unsurpassed work ethic. As 2015 ended, I continued my record of never missing a roll-call vote since my Senate service began in 1997, a tally that now stands at 6,072 consecutive votes.\u00a0 I am grateful for the opportunity to work on your behalf as your Senator, and I wish everyone a happy and healthy 2016."},

WAP also supports thousands of high quality jobs. \u00a0The National Association of State Community Services Programs estimates there are around 8,000 highly skilled jobs in the weatherization network, with countless more supplied in related U.S. businesses, including materials suppliers, vendors, and manufacturers that make more than 90 percent of the products used in weatherization. \u00a0WAP has helped the construction industry and given a boost to U.S. manufacturers and small businesses during challenging economic times. The last comprehensive study of the SEP program by Oak Ridge National Lab showed that each federal dollar invested in SEP is leveraged by nearly $1 in state and private funds, and results in more than $4.10 in annual energy savings."},
{"title": "ICYMI: \u201cCollins calls for Alzheimer's support, funding after tour of Falmouth center\u201d", "date": ["Posted Wed, 01/06/2016 - 08:02"], "release": "\u2014 The message from Maine\u2019s senior U.S. senator was clear Tuesday morning: the state and the nation must do more for those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the people who care for them. Speaking at the Lunt Auditorium at 74 Lunt Road, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said while Alzheimer\u2019s is \u201ca devastating disease\u201d for the patient, it is also harmful to family members who become caretakers. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to talk about Alzheimer\u2019s without talking about the caregivers,\u201d Collins said. She said the number of people with Alzheimer\u2019s is \u201cgoing to explode\u201d as the nation gets older, unless more is done in the field of research and funding. Collins earlier Tuesday toured the Stewart Adult Day Center, also at 74 Lunt Road. The center, a day facility for individuals with dementia, was opened by the Southern Maine Agency on Aging in October 2014. She applauded the work being done at the center as not only a benefit to those with diseases, but also as a resource for caregivers. \u201cWhat a difference it makes to be able to bring your loved ones to a place they can be entertained \u2026 and be able to give yourself a much-needed break,\u201d Collins said. Collins said memory-care centers can help keep dementia patients in their own homes and communities, and provide respite for their caregivers. \u201cIt improves the quality of life for everyone,\u201d she said. Following her remarks, Collins said facilities like the Stewart Center are vital in Maine, which has the oldest median age in the nation. \u201cWe are disproportionately affected by this disease that strikes our seniors,\u201d Collins said. Collins said she was amazed by the number of activities the Stewart Center offered. She said these types of facilities offer good ways to prevent people from becoming isolated which, she said, \u201cexacerbates the illness.\u201d Collins, who chairs the Senate Aging Committee and co-chairs the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, during her remarks spoke about the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support and Engage (RAISE) Family Caregivers Act, which was passed by the Senate last month. The act, which Collins introduced with Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, calls for development of a national strategy to recognize and support more than 40 million family caregivers across the country. Collins said the next step will be working hard to get RAISE through the House of Representatives, in order to create that national strategy. \u201cI\u2019m convinced more respite centers are part of the answer,\u201d Collins said. Collins also spoke about the $2 billion funding increase Congress approved last year for the National Institutes of Health, including a $350 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s disease research. She said that brings total research funding for Alzheimer\u2019s disease to $936 million.

She said Alzheimer\u2019s is the only disease without an effective means of treatment or cure, and that it would bankrupt Medicare and Medicaid \u201cunless we come up with better means of prevention or cure.\u201d Because NIH now has the funding, Collins said, it can solicit grant applications it did not have the funding to seek in years past.

{"title": "From the Days of Sail to the Age of the Atom, PNSY Works to Keep our Navy Strong ", "date": ["Posted Tue, 01/12/2016 - 09:24"], "release": "The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard was established by the United States government in 1800 and its first new product, the 74-gun ship of the line  , was launched in 1814.\u00a0 Today, our Navy\u2019s oldest continuously operating public shipyard is tasked with the overhaul, repair, and modernization of America\u2019s nuclear submarine fleet.\u00a0\u00a0 PNSY truly has gone from the days of sail to the age of the atom. An event there early this month demonstrates why the Shipyard\u2019s slogan, \u201cProud of our past, ready for the future,\u201d rings true.\u00a0 The occasion was the ribbon-cutting for a renovated structure that played a key role in the history of the 20th Century and that now will help our nation meet the challenges of the 21st. When it opened in 1939, it was called \u201cBuilding Ways,\u201d for the sloped shipways that enabled construction and launching.\u00a0 During World War II, more than 70 submarines were built at PNSY, with three of those vital warships launched in a single day.\u00a0 Building Ways remained an important part of the arsenal of democracy into the Cold War. Now called \u201cBuilding 178,\u201d the 170,000-square foot structure was little used in recent years primarily due to sections of roof failure caused by snow loads.\u00a0 \u00a0The $38-million renovation unveiled on January 6th\u00a0includes extensive structural repairs and modernization as well as new water, heat, and fire-protection systems.\u00a0 This project turned a building eligible for the National Register of Historic Places into a state-of-the-art facility that will enable the Shipyard\u2019s employees to overhaul submarines even more efficiently.\u00a0 The history that led to that celebration is worth telling, for it is a story of resolve and unity.\u00a0 Ten years ago, our Shipyard was threatened with closure.\u00a0 The people of Maine and New Hampshire reached across the border and across the political aisle to save our Shipyard, to preserve thousands of good jobs, and to help keep America secure.\u00a0 All of us shared the pride of the Shipyard workers when the Chairman of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, or BRAC, described the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard as the \u201cgold standard.\u201d Five years ago, my New Hampshire colleagues, Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Senator Kelley Ayotte, joined former Maine Senator Olympia Snowe and me to author a provision of the Defense Authorization Act for a plan to modernize the Shipyard.\u00a0 As a member at the time of both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I advocated strongly for $100 million of funding for the security, modernization, and restoration that make the current round of improvements, of which Building 178 is a part, possible. These developments represent years of hard work and effective collaboration among members of the Maine and New Hampshire delegations, Navy officials, and the outstanding men and women of PNSY who keep our submarine fleet ready for crucial national security missions. Those men and women made the difference.\u00a0 During the fight to save our Shipyard a decade ago, we members of the Maine-New Hampshire delegations pointed to the Meritorious Unit Commendation that recognized their \u201cunrelenting determination, perseverance, and steadfast devotion to duty Going forward, we can also point to their record-breaking work that delivered the attack submarine   back into service last summer ahead of schedule and under budget.\u00a0 The fastest complete overhaul in the Navy\u2019s history also established new benchmarks for safety and quality control. \u00a0I am so pleased that the modernization of PNSY will provide them with another workplace deserving of their dedication. I will continue to advocate for the acceleration of military construction and facility modernization projects at the Shipyard, and across the services, as we continue to advocate for budgets that will keep our Navy strong. From 1800 to our time, from sail to the atom, much has changed.\u00a0 But the threats to freedom remain, and the oceans have not gotten any smaller. I will continue to fight for a Navy that will enable America to meet every challenge.\u00a0 And I know the men and women of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard will be there to make sure our submarines are ready to answer the call of duty.\u00a0"},

{"title": "Collins, King, Poliquin Send Letter to President on Possible National Monument Designation in Maine North Woods", "date": ["Posted Mon, 11/23/2015 - 00:00"], "release": " \u2013 U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King and Representative Bruce Poliquin have sent a letter to President Barack Obama regarding the possible designation of land in the Katahdin region as a national monument. The complete text of the letter can be read   and is available below. +++ November 20, 2015 The President The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear Mr. President: We understand that you are considering using your executive power under the Antiquities Act to designate unilaterally as a national monument more than 100,000 acres of what is currently privately owned land in northern Maine and write to express our serious reservations and significant concerns about such a proposal. The private land owner, Elliotsville Plantation Inc. (EPI), has made clear that it would like to donate its land in the Katahdin Region to the federal government for the purpose of establishing a national park and national recreation area, which would require an act of Congress.\u00a0 The president of EPI\u2019s board, Mr. Lucas St. Clair, has recently informed us that he is in discussions with the Department of Interior to bypass Congress to seek a national monument designation.\u00a0 This concerns us because residents in the Katahdin Region have the most to gain or lose from federal land encroaching on their doorstep, and it is clear that deep divisions remain. While we acknowledge the right of private land owners to donate their land, we have serious concerns about the executive branch using its power to unilaterally designate a national monument in our state.\u00a0 Mainers have a long and proud history of private land ownership, independence, and local control, and do not take lightly any forced action by the federal government to increase its footprint in our state.\u00a0 Recognizing that despite these concerns, you nevertheless may use your legal authority to bypass the normal legislative process and designate a national monument in Maine, we believe that you should be aware of the history of this proposal and the conditions that we strongly believe must be included if such a designation moves forward.\u00a0 For many years, EPI has been working to build local support to establish a national park and national recreation area on its land.\u00a0 As Members of Maine\u2019s Congressional Delegation, it is incumbent upon us to research thoroughly such a controversial issue. We have devoted countless hours to meet with stakeholders, including local business owners, forest product industry officials, snowmobile clubs, hunting groups, outdoor recreation organizations, environmental groups, local land owners, and land preservation trusts. We have responded to hundreds of emails, letters, and phone calls from local area residents.\u00a0 Our offices have toured the property in question and have attended local town hall meetings devoted to discussing publicly the proposal.\u00a0 We believe we have thoughtfully considered all points of view and have carefully listened to all sides of this issue. Proponents and opponents alike target more jobs for the struggling Katahdin Region as the basis for their conclusions.\u00a0 Some residents believe that one way to stimulate the regional economy, decimated by the closure of paper mills in the area, would be for the federal government to create a national park and national recreation area to boost tourism and outdoor recreation jobs.\u00a0 Local chambers of commerce support this opportunity and cite economic studies which point to job creation around other national parks across the country.\u00a0 In a recent poll, the idea of a national park was supported by roughly 60 percent of Mainers. Other residents believe that any form of federal ownership could jeopardize jobs and future job creation in the prized Katahdin Region\u2019s working forests. In two non-binding referendums this past summer, more than 70 percent of the residents living in two of the most affected communities voted in opposition to creating a national park on this land.\u00a0 In addition, 225 Maine businesses that employ more than 5,000 hard-working Mainers, many in the logging, trucking, saw mill, and other forest products industries, announced their opposition to the proposal, largely because they believe that federal ownership would hurt their businesses and prevent future investment and job creation. The federal government is also struggling to meet its current obligations to fund our 408 existing national park units, with a current maintenance backlog of $11.5 billion. Adding more than 100,000 acres to the federal land system would only add to that burden. We cannot underscore enough the importance of bringing new economic development to this severely economically depressed region of Maine.\u00a0 A national monument designation, however, would likely antagonize already divided local communities.\u00a0 The future of EPI\u2019s property is just one part of a greater need to improve economic opportunity in the Katahdin Region. To that end, we request the full assistance of the federal government to identify and secure funding for economic development activities through the Economic Development Assistance Program and other manufacturing programs that could help the forest products industry and other entrepreneurs in the area.\u00a0 Specifically, we seek financial support for research to back the development and use of wood products and fibers, advanced engineering projects that use wood, and support for policies that will create strong markets for wood products. Our many discussions with local residents and businesses have deepened our understanding of the viewpoints and needs of the Katahdin Region. Despite our reservations, if you nevertheless choose to use your executive power under the Antiquities Act to accept the EPI land donation and to designate a new national monument, we strongly urge that you incorporate the following conditions: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Express permission for all traditional recreation uses, including hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, canoeing, kayaking, the use of motorized vehicles, such as snowmobiles and ATVs, and other outdoor recreational activities associated with our North Maine Woods. Maine has a long and cherished history of public access to large tracts of privately owned land. This invaluable relationship must be protected so that citizens are able to continue to recreate freely and responsibly. 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Protection for the long term well-being of our prized forests, both within the borders of any federal land designation and for the adjacent and surrounding areas.\u00a0 Any federal land must allow for proper forest management, including timber harvesting, to prevent forest fires and invasive species and to allow for proper sustainable tree growth.\u00a0 Moreover, the surrounding lands have robust forestry activities such as logging, trucking, and timber harvesting, and any federal land designation must not impair these industries, their good paying jobs or inhibit future growth in this sector.\u00a0 The forest products industry employs nearly 40,000 hard-working Mainers. One out of every 20 jobs in Maine is associated with the forest products sector.\u00a0 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All private or state land that is contiguous, adjacent, or nearby, or any inholdings, must continue to have established easements and rights of way, including for roads, and remain independent of any federal control. This independence must also include freedom from view shed, air quality, or buffer zone regulations or requirements.\u00a0 No federal regulations should be put in place that would discourage future investment or growth in the region. 4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any monument designation must respect private property rights and ensure that the federal government will never take any private land in the area by eminent domain.\u00a0 All land must be acquired from a willing seller through donation or purchase.\u00a0 Concerns have been raised about the size of the parcel in question, as for some time many believed that EPI owned 150,000 acres of the proposed national park and national recreation area.\u00a0 In fact, more than 40 percent of the proposed area is owned by other private landowners, some of whom have adamantly expressed they have no interest in selling their land for inclusion in any federal land system.\u00a0 5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Management needs of the area must be carefully examined to determine the appropriate federal land management agency.\u00a0 The U.S. Forest Service, with its history of working closely with communities to preserve traditional uses, should be considered as an agency to oversee any national monument designation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Establishment of a local and state advisory board to ensure that any management decisions reflect local and state priorities, not the priorities of Washington.\u00a0 Local communities know how to make their own decisions and that autonomy should continue. 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Federal commitment to help improve the economically depressed Katahdin Region and create new jobs must accompany any new federal land designation. This should include efforts related to tourism and outdoor recreation, as well as the forest products industry. 8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When creating the educational and interpretive experience for any public land in question, it is critical to have a special emphasis on the Katahdin Region\u2019s rich history, including the important roles of the timber industry, local communities, and the Penobscot Nation.\u00a0 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Preference for Maine businesses and products in creating and servicing any federally designated public lands. For example, Maine timber should be used to construct buildings, and Maine concessioners should be hired to provide services and products inside the boundaries of any national monument. Neighbors to federal lands are more likely to support federal initiatives when Washington employs their direct support. In closing, while we respect the right of EPI to donate its private property to the federal government, we cannot ignore the serious reservations of our constituents. We urge you to carefully weigh the views of those who live in the region, as well as the criteria we have outlined in this letter. The last thing the Katahdin Region needs is burdensome and restrictive federal regulations that discourage future investment and badly needed jobs while changing the traditional Maine way of life."},

People from every race, culture, and creed on the face of the Earth now inhabit this land. Their presence illuminates the basic yearning for freedom, peace, and prosperity that has always been the spirit of the New World.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Those who serve our country in uniform and all of the people throughout our great state who use their time and talents to make a real difference in their communities keep that spirit alive.\u00a0 We have so much to be thankful for and to celebrate this holiday season.\u00a0\u00a0"},

Senator Collins is a senior member of the HELP Committee. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray, for convening this hearing.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In many states, including Maine, the prescription drug abuse crisis has also become a heroin crisis, overwhelming our communities and families, often with tragic consequences. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maine has been particularly hard hit by this epidemic: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But perhaps most tragic is the impact on the most vulnerable in our society \u2013 the babies born to addicts.\u00a0 In Maine, in the last fiscal year, nearly 1,000 babies were born drug and/or alcohol-addicted, a number which represents eight percent of all births in our state.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Maine and New Hampshire have the dubious distinction of having the most prescriptions per person for long-acting and high-dose painkillers according to the CDC. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And when those prescriptions lead to addiction, the next stop is too often heroin.\u00a0 According to a study by the Maine Sunday Telegram, international drug cartels and inner-city drug gangs have targeted Maine as an emerging and lucrative market for heroin.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This epidemic is playing out in emergency rooms, county jails, and on Main Streets in my state and throughout the country.\u00a0\u00a0 Maine\u2019s Sheriffs tell me that their jails are overwhelmed by those struggling with addiction and that they cannot arrest their way out of this epidemic. They are not designed to take the place of treatment centers, and yet sheriffs and police chiefs must train their officers to look for signs of withdrawal and monitor mental health status. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I recently received a letter from a constituent of mine detailing his road to addiction, which began in high school as a result of football injuries for which he was given oxycodin. It was in college when the use of painkillers became a serious problem and later led to him to use heroin. Unfortunately, his story is sad but common.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 His letter goes on to describe his attempt to treat depression with pain killers and \u201cyears of chasing the feeling of being \u2018normal.\u2019\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is important that our Committee is examining this serious public health crisis and I want to commend our leaders for doing so."},

You can see the world\u2019s best rock 'n' roll drummers using drumsticks that were produced in Maine; fashion catalogues with models wearing shoes and boots that were hand sewn in the state; and college and professional hockey players carrying their gear in bags that were manufactured in Maine. When you go to New York City, you will see that the number-one bottled beverage in the Big Apple is not a soft drink; it is Poland Spring water. \u00a0In slugging their way to the 2015 World Series Championship, four members of the Kansas City Royals used wooden bats made in Shirley, Maine. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I never cease to be amazed by the creativity of Mainers and the incredible work that is happening here in a quiet way. \u00a0In the past year alone, I have met with many Maine business leaders, entrepreneurs, and employees, as well as academic and civic leaders, who are having success in providing opportunity and strengthening our communities. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 One is Steel-Pro, an employee-owned business in Rockland that provides highly-technical steel fabrication services, including the development of bio-pharmaceutical equipment and vacuum chambers for companies like GE Healthcare. \u00a0 Newport Industrial Fabrication showed me how their small shop is providing complex steel work for projects all over the country for everything ranging from massive load-bearing structures for bridges to elegant glass facades in modern buildings. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Another is the Buck Family Farm in Mapleton that has begun providing malted barley for our state\u2019s growing craft beer industry. There are more than 1400 people working in jobs related to the craft beer industry in Maine. \u00a0From Allagash to Shipyard to Baxter to Gritty\u2019s and many more, the 60 breweries we have in Maine have earned a national reputation for providing truly exceptional beers.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 On a broader level, Maine's entire food products industry continues to excel. Maine lobsters, blueberries, potatoes, broccoli, cheeses, oysters, mustards, smoked salmon, and many more products -- even sea urchins -- continue to be in high demand. \u00a0On a recent trip overseas, I brought Amy Bouchard\u2019s Wicked Whoopies from Gardiner to the soldiers and sailors from our state. \u00a0 Believe me, they were a big hit.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The increasing interest in knowing where your food comes from and the demand for local products has actually produced an increase in the number of farmers that we have in this state \u2013 reversing a decades-long trend away from agriculture. \u00a0And the success of our natural food products has dovetailed nicely with the success of our restaurants.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Portland has become a dining destination, adding another facet to a statewide hospitality and tourism industry that is known worldwide. The cruise ships in our ports this fall and the snowmobile trailers on the highway in the winter are two of the ways we are extending the months that we typically think of as tourist season.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our Maine craftsmen continue to produce quality wood products that are highly prized. The most famous example of this work can be found in Auburn, at the Thomas Moser facility I visited last fall. And this magnificent work is now on display in Washington, at a beautiful retail store in the heart of Georgetown where Senator Angus King and I attended the opening this spring. \u00a0On the wall of my Senate office on loan from Tom Moser is a true work of art: a large hand-crafted American flag that he made from three kinds of wood. \u00a0It never ceases to amaze and inspire my visitors \u2013 and me. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 People really do love the quality of Maine products. Last spring, I was at Maine Wood Concepts in New Vineyard. \u00a0They make handcrafted wood products, most notably wooden pepper mills. The high-end retailer Williams-Sonoma used to import pepper mills from China, until they discovered the far superior products made by Maine Wood Concepts. They have now dropped their Chinese suppliers and prominently feature these pepper mills produced by Maine craftsmen in their catalog. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Innovative small businesses like these continue to impress me with their ability to find a niche. \u00a0Erda is a small manufacturing company that makes artisan handbags in Dexter. \u00a0Sue Nordman bought the company two years ago and hired primarily women over age 60 who used to work in the shoe business. \u00a0This small company\u2019s handbags can be found throughout the United States in fine galleries and boutiques. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Another business that is quintessentially Maine is Beth Shissler\u2019s Sea Bags in Portland. \u00a0It recycles old sails into beautiful, waterproof tote bags. \u00a0In the past 16 years, it has grown from two employees to more than 50. \u00a0Residents and visitors alike love its quality products that celebrate our maritime history in such a unique way. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 American manufacturing is supposed to be a thing of the past, but it appears that nobody told the nearly 1,000 Maine employees I visited at New Balance last year. \u00a0Their running shoes are a favorite and soon, I hope, will be available to our military recruits. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our State is also home to a Procter & Gamble manufacturing plant that employs nearly 450 Mainers. \u00a0Think of all the products that Procter & Gamble makes.\u00a0 For three years in a row the company\u2019s top performing facility in all of North America has been its plant in Auburn. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And I know that Corning is very proud of its manufacturing and research facility in Kennebunk that celebrated its 50th anniversary when I visited this summer. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our defense industry in Maine continues to provide our military with what it needs to keep us safe. The highly technical jet engine parts produced at Pratt & Whitney in North Berwick and the remarkable work that is done on our nuclear submarines at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard are popular with our military because of the quality of Maine work. \u00a0Pratt & Whitney executives have repeatedly told me that the North Berwick plant is a real gem because of its talented workforce. \u00a0The PNSY is hiring an additional 200 workers to keep up with its workload, providing great jobs to residents throughout York County. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Recently, I attended a ceremony at Bath Iron Works, where we christened the USS Raphael Peralta, an Arleigh Burke destroyer. \u00a0And soon the most advanced Navy destroyer in the world \u2013 \u00a0the DDG-1000 built in Bath by our highly skilled Maine workers \u2013 will be part of our nation\u2019s fleet. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 From new entrepreneurs to established iconic businesses like L.L. Bean, Geiger Bros., Unum, Idexx and WEX - there are more great Maine stories than I could ever begin to list.\u00a0 With all the challenges that we face, good things are happening every day in Maine. \u00a0We should celebrate the successes that can be found in every corner of our State."},

See below. \u00a0 By: Senator Susan Collins November 13, 2015 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As a Senator representing the state with the oldest median age, I am particularly focused on the well-being of America\u2019s seniors. It has been my privilege to serve on the Senate Special Committee on Aging since my first days in the Senate and an honor to have been elected chairman for the 114th Congress. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The committee has three major priorities: investing in biomedical research targeting diseases that disproportionately affect older Americans, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and diabetes; protecting seniors against financial exploitation and scams and improving retirement security. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In my work as chairman of the Congressional Alzheimer\u2019s Caucus, I have learned much about our nation\u2019s most costly disease and the devastating effect it has on more than five million Americans and their families. Although promising research is underway, there currently are no means of prevention, effective treatments or a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The good news is that the Senate Appropriations Committee, on which I serve, recently approved a 60 percent increase in Alzheimer\u2019s research funding. I am delighted that the Senate is finally recognizing the need for a greater investment in Alzheimer\u2019s research and will work for this funding to be retained in the final version of the appropriations for the National Institutes of Health. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A national plan to combat Alzheimer\u2019s and other debilitating conditions must include assistance for the family caregivers on the front lines. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The bipartisan RAISE Family Caregivers Act that I have introduced would help us to leverage our resources, promote innovation and promising practices and provide our nation\u2019s family caregivers with much-needed recognition and support. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Investments in biomedical research not only improve the health and longevity of Americans, but also provide ongoing benefits to our economy and the federal budget. For example, nearly one of three Medicare dollars is spent treating people with diabetes, and the incidence and costs of that disease are projected to go up as our population ages. Advancements in the prevention and treatment of diabetes can save lives and help extend the solvency of Medicare. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Since I founded the Senate Diabetes Caucus in 1997, funding for diabetes research has more than tripled from $319 million to well over a billion dollars this year. As a consequence, we have seen some encouraging breakthroughs and are on the threshold of a number of new discoveries. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Aging Committee has taken an aggressive approach to fighting fraud and schemes targeting our nation\u2019s seniors. Financial exploitation of older Americans is a growing epidemic that cost seniors an estimated $2.9 billion in 2010. It is very troubling that in as many as 90 percent of these cases, the senior is victimized by someone he or she knows well. Financial abuse of seniors can jeopardize their physical and emotional well-being as well as their financial security. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Maine is on the cutting edge of helping to combat financial abuse through a program called \u201cSenior$afe,\u201d which is a collaborative effort by Maine, financial institutions, regulators and legal organizations to help educate bank and credit union employees about how to identify and help stop financial exploitation. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Based on that model, Senator McCaskill and I have introduced the \u201cSenior$safe Act of 2015,\u201d which would put in place a commonsense plan to help protect American seniors from financial fraud. This bipartisan legislation would encourage financial institutions to train their employees and shield them from suit when they make good faith, reasonable reports of potential fraud to the proper authorities."},

{"title": "The Senior$afe Act: A Commonsense Plan to Help Protect American Seniors from Financial Fraud", "date": ["Posted Fri, 11/20/2015 - 00:00"], "release": "\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Earlier this year, a senior citizen in Vassalboro\u00a0intended to wire funds from his account at Maine Savings Federal Credit Union to an out-of-state location, supposedly to bail out a relative who was in jail.\u00a0 Something about this transaction didn\u2019t sound right to the teller supervisor at the credit union.\u00a0 She questioned the customer, who told her he had gotten a call from an \u201cofficial\u201d at the jail, who had instructed him not to speak to anyone about the transaction.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Fortunately for this senior citizen, the supervisor had received training through Maine's innovative Senior$afe program, a collaborative effort by Maine\u2019s regulators, financial institutions, and legal organizations to educate bank and credit union employees on how to identify and help stop financial exploitation of older Mainers.\u00a0 The supervisor\u00a0was able to spot this as a scam, and her quick thinking saved this senior from falling victim to it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 According to the Government Accountability Office, financial fraud targeting older Americans is a growing epidemic that costs seniors an estimated $2.9 billion annually.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, protecting seniors from financial exploitation and fraud is one of my top priorities.\u00a0 The Senior$afe program, pioneered by Maine Securities Administrator Judith Shaw, serves as the\u00a0model for\u00a0bipartisan legislation that I recently introduced with my colleague and the Ranking Member of the Aging Committee, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri.\u00a0 The Senior$afe Act of 2015 would put in place a commonsense plan to help protect American seniors from financial fraud.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Over the past two and a half years, our Committee has held 15 hearings \u2013 six since January -- examining how fraudsters find and exploit their victims and what can be done to stop them.\u00a0 The frauds we have highlighted have ranged from the infamous \u201cJamaican Lottery Scam,\u201d that reached its height in 2013, to the notorious IRS phone scam that burst onto the scene this spring, and, more recently, to the shady practices of the pension advance industry.\u00a0 Sadly, not all scammers are strangers to their victims.\u00a0 In too many cases, the senior is exploited by someone he or she knows well.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Although the different scams we have examined differ in scope and structure, one factor is common to all \u2013 the fraudsters need to gain the trust and active cooperation of their victims.\u00a0 Without this, their schemes would fail.\u00a0 That is why it is so important that seniors recognize as quickly as possible the red flags that signal potential fraud.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Unfortunately, many people do not see these red flags.\u00a0 Sometimes they are simply too trusting, but, just as often, they miss the flags because the swindlers who prey on them are extremely crafty and know how to sound convincing.\u00a0 Whatever the reason, a warning sign that can slip by a victim might trigger a second look by financial service representatives trained to spot common scams and who know enough about a senior's habits to question a transaction that doesn\u2019t look right.\u00a0 In our work on the Aging Committee, we have heard of many instances where quick action by bank and credit union employees, broker-dealers, and investment advisors has stopped a fraud in progress, saving their customers untold thousands of dollars.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Regrettably, federal laws with the important intention of protecting consumer privacy can make it difficult for financial institutions to report suspected fraud to the proper authorities.\u00a0 The Senior$afe Act\u00a0would clarify these laws to encourage banks, credit unions, investment advisors, and broker-dealers to report suspected financial fraud targeting senior citizens to regulators, law enforcement, or adult protective services agencies.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A key feature of our bill is the liability protection it provides: financial institutions and their employees are protected from lawsuits so long as employees are trained in how to spot and report suspected financial exploitation, their reports are made in good faith and on a reasonable basis, and they report to the proper authorities.\u00a0 With the Senior$afe program in place, bank tellers all over the country will know how to respond when they are confronted with a situation like the one faced by the Vassalboro credit union supervisor.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Combating financial abuse of seniors requires regulators, law enforcement, and social service agencies at all levels of government to work collaboratively with the private sector.\u00a0 Financial institutions occupy a critical nexus between fraudsters and their victims and can play an important role.\u00a0 Their employees, if properly trained, can be the first line of defense protecting our seniors from these fraudsters.\u00a0 The Senior$afe Act encourages financial institutions to train their employees and shields them from lawsuits when they make good faith, reasonable reports of potential fraud to the proper authorities."},
{"title": "ICYMI: Maine State Chamber Honors U.S. Sen. Susan Collins", "date": ["Posted Sat, 10/31/2015 - 00:00"], "release": "AUGUSTA \u2014 In front of a crowd of about 500 business people from across the state, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, joined an elite list of Maine leaders Friday night. At its annual meeting at the Augusta Civic Center, the Maine State Chamber of Commerce presented Maine\u2019s senior senator with the Alton \u201cChuck\u201d Cianchette Business Hall of Fame award. \u201cWe could not be more pleased to present the Maine State Chamber\u2019s highest award to Sen. Collins for her decades of leadership and service to the people of Maine,\u201d Maine State Chamber of Commerce President Dana Connors said. \u201cWe are very humbled to express our thanks for the countless ways she has served the people of Maine.\u201d Named for Alton \u201cChuck\u201d Cianchette, the award recognizes the contributions of an individual who demonstrates public service leadership, business success and embodies the spirit of Cianchette through compassion, courage and commitment. Cianchette founded Cianbro Corp. with his three brothers in 1949, and throughout his life, Cianchette served his community as an elected official at the town and state levels and as a volunteer and advocate for a number of community organizations. Connor said Collins was an easy choice for the award because she has distinguished herself through her service to the people of Maine and at a national level because of her ability to find solutions and work across party lines. \u201cWhen you have someone who is that successful, we can take that for granted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate to dedicate the meeting to her.\u201d Collins, who was appointed the commissioner of the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation in 1987, was also the director of the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s Boston office. She became the founding director of the Center for Family Business at Husson University after an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in 1994. She was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996 and has been re-elected three times, most recently in 2014. In an interview with the Kennebec Journal, Collins said she\u2019s honored to receive the award. Her work in support of business in Maine dates back to her days of working for the state. She listed her work at the state level to reform the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system as one of her most significant contributions to business. \u201cThe state was losing jobs, and employers were struggling to cope with the costs, which were the highest in the nation,\u201d she said. As the ranking Republican and then the chairwoman of the Senate\u2019s Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, she has been able to secure $110 million in TIGER (Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery) grants for projects in Maine, including work at the state\u2019s three ports, bridge improvements, and most recently, funding to improve railroad infrastructure to make moving Maine products out of state more feasible. She\u2019s also pleased to have worked on keeping the heaviest trucks on the interstates and out of downtowns. Now, two of the biggest challenges facing businesses in Maine are energy costs and uncertainty in the tax code. Although the price of heating oil is low now, it could go up at any time, she said. While natural gas is a cheaper alternative for heating, Maine lacks the pipelines needed to bring it into the state and make it widely available. As additional natural gas pipelines are considered, Collins said it\u2019s critical for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \u2014 whose authority extends to natural gas pipelines \u2014 acts with all deliberate speed while ensuring the proper environmental reviews are completed to open up more of the state to natural gas. That will help the state\u2019s manufacturers be more competitive and help homeowners with heating costs, she said. Large and small business owners alike tell her they are looking for more consistency in the tax code, Collins said. Chief among their concerns is Section 179, a provision that governs how much of a write off business owners can take on equipment in a year. Some years, the level is as high as $250,000, but in 2015, the limit is $25,000. Collins said the level is set by provisions that expire, but she has introduced a bill to make it permanent. \u201cI was talking to Rob Tod at Allagash Brewing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen that (higher level) was in effect, he was able to buy more equipment and put more people to work,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a direct correlation.\u201d That lack of certainty and the complexity of the tax code stand in the way of business investment, she said. \u201cBusiness owners tell me, \u2018I can deal with anything; just let me know what the rules are going to be,'\u201d she said. Collins joins a list of political and business leaders that includes former Gov. Ken Curtis, former Sen. Olympia Snowe, then-Gov. Angus King, former L.L. Bean president Leon Gorman and philanthropist Madeleine Corson in the Business Hall of Fame."},

President, I rise to speak in favor of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 and to urge my colleagues to support this bill.\u00a0 Nearly three months ago, the Senate was unable to find a path forward to adopt this important legislation.\u00a0 Since that time when the Senate refused to proceed, our country has continued to endure a wave of damaging and expensive cyber attacks.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 These incidents include the first major hack of Apple\u2019s popular AppStore, the compromise of 15 million T-Mobile users due to a breach at Experian; and the exposure of data of up to 8,000 Army families due to improper procedures followed by General Services Administration. For the Army families that were affected, this sensitive information included medical histories, Social Security numbers, and child daycare details. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Today, I renew my support for this bill in light of the continuing state of cyber insecurity that affects information in the public and private sectors. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Passing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act would make it easier for public and private sector entities to share cyber threat information in order to lessen the theft of trade and national security secrets as well as the compromise of personal information.\u00a0 It would eliminate some of the legal and economic barriers impeding voluntary two-way information sharing between private industry and government.\u00a0 It is a modest but essential first step to protect networks and their information. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 While this bill promotes appropriate information sharing between the government and private sector, a good first step, it does little to harden the protection of federal networks or to guard the critical infrastructure we rely upon every day.\u00a0 Thus, I have introduced two amendments to further strengthen our nation\u2019s cyber security. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The first amendment is directed at improving the security of sensitive data that is stored on the networks of federal civilian agencies. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The insecurity of federal databases and networks has been evident for years and is underscored by recent breaches.\u00a0 In June, more than 20 million current, former, and retired federal employees learned that their personal data were stolen from the poorly secured databases at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).\u00a0 Since that time, we have learned that the personal emails of the Director of Central Intelligence have been hacked.\u00a0 We have learned from the State Department\u2019s Inspector General that the State Department is \u201camong the worst agencies in the federal government at protecting its computer networks.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This substandard performance continued even as an adversary nation breached the Department\u2019s email system last year.\u00a0 According to the IG, compliance with the federal information security standards remains \u201csubstandard\u201d at the State Department.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This appalling performance in so many agencies and departments led to my introducing bipartisan legislation with Senators Warner, Mikulski, Coats, Ayotte, and McCaskill to strengthen the security of the networks of federal civilian agencies. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This legislation has five elements, but the most important provision would grant the Department of Homeland Security the authority to issue binding operational directives to federal agencies to respond in the face of a substantial breach or to take action in the face of an imminent threat to federal networks.\u00a0\u00a0 Although the Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with a similar responsibility to protect federal civilian networks, he has far less authority to accomplish this task than the Director of the NSA does for dot-mil networks.\u00a0 We can no longer ignore the damaging consequences of failing to address these issues. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our amendment would fortify federal computer networks from cyber threats in other ways, and the key elements of our bill were incorporated into an amendment filed by Senator Carper that Senator Johnson, Senator Warner, and I have cosponsored.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our amendment has been included in the managers\u2019 substitute amendment, and I thank Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein for their willingness to include these important provisions. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I also filed amendment #2623 to the cyber bill that is aimed at protecting our country\u2019s most vital critical infrastructure from cyber attack.\u00a0 This bipartisan amendment was cosponsored by Senators Hirono, Warner, and Coats. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The livelihood of almost every American depends upon critical infrastructure that includes the electricity that powers our communities, the national air transportation system that moves passengers and cargo safely from one location to another, and the elements of the financial sector that ensure the $14 trillion in payments made every day are securely routed through the banking system. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The amendment would have created a second tier of mandatory reporting to the government for the fewer than 65 entities identified by the Department of Homeland Security where damage caused by a single cyber attack could likely cause catastrophic harm in the form of more than $50 billion in economic damage, 2,500 fatalities, or a sever degradation of our national security.\u00a0 In other words, only cyber attacks that could cause catastrophic results would fall under this reporting requirement. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For 99 percent of businesses, the voluntary information sharing framework established in this cyber legislation will be enough, and the decision on whether or not to share cyber threat information should rightly be left up to them. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A second tier of reporting is necessary, however, to protect the critical infrastructure that is vital to the safety, health, and economic well-being of the American people.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Under our amendment, the owners and operators of the country\u2019s most critical infrastructure would report significant cyber attacks just as incidents of communicable disease outbreaks must be reported to public health authorities and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Think about the situation we have here:\u00a0 does it make sense that we require one case of the measles to be reported to the government, but not a cyber attack that could result in the death of more than 2,500 people? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The threats to our critical infrastructure are not hypothetical \u2013 they are already occurring in increasing frequency and severity.\u00a0 At a recent Armed Services Committee hearing on cybersecurity, Senator Donnelly asked the Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, what the one cyber challenge was that he was most concerned about. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Director Clapper testified that it was a large-scale cyber attack against the United States\u2019 infrastructure.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In light of this number one threat, how protected is our country? I posed that question to the Director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Mike Rogers.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 His answer, on a scale of 1-10, was that we are at a \u201c5 or 6\u201d.\u00a0 That is a failing grade in protecting critical infrastructure -- no matter what curve we are grading on. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Although I am disappointed that the Senate will not consider the original amendment I filed, I want to thank Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein for working with me on compromise language to begin to address the issue of cybersecurity risks that present such significant security threats to our critical infrastructure. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This new amendment, which is Section 407 of the managers\u2019 amendment, requires the DHS Secretary to conduct an assessment of the fewer than 65 critical infrastructure entities at greatest risk and develop a strategy to mitigate the risks of a catastrophic cyber attack.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Let me again describe what we mean by \u201ccatastrophic\u201d attack. It means a single cyber attack that would likely result in $50 billion in economic damage, 2,500 Americans dead, or severe degradation of our national security.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There are plenty of cyber threats that cannot be talked about in public because they are classified.\u00a0 But in light of the cyber threat to critical infrastructure described by Admiral Rogers and DNI Clapper in open testimony before the Congress, the bare minimum we ought to do is to ask DHS and the appropriate federal agencies to describe what more could be done to prevent a catastrophic cyber attack on our critical infrastructure. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 By including these two provisions into the managers\u2019 substitute amendment, we are strengthening the cyber defenses of our federal agency networks and the country\u2019s critical infrastructure. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I urge my colleagues to support the managers\u2019 amendment and the underlying bill. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 By passing this long overdue legislation, we will begin the work of securing our economic and national security for the next generation.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I yield the floor, Madam President."},

Sergeant Peralta was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his heroism and courage under fire.\u00a0 He gave his life by grabbing a live grenade and absorbing the blast with his body \u2013 sacrificing his life for the lives of his fellow Marines.\u00a0 He exemplifies all our nation holds dear:\u00a0 honor, sacrifice, and selflessness.\u00a0 He answered our nation\u2019s call to duty.\u00a0 He gave his life for freedom\u2019s cause. \u00a0There can be no doubt that his spirit lives on and will continue to do so as she preserves free passage on the seas, deters our enemies, and perhaps sails into battle. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe Peralta family forged Sgt Peralta\u2019s character, courage, and dedication.\u00a0 My hope is that this family, who suffered such a terrible loss, will find comfort in the prayers of a grateful nation,\u201dSenator Collins continued.\u00a0\u00a0 See below for a copy of Senator Collins\u2019 remarks as prepared for delivery:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thank you, Matt.\u00a0 Senator King, Congresswoman Pingree, Congressman Poliquin, General Neller, Assistant Secretary Stackley, President Harris, officers and crew of the Rafael Peralta, Marines, men and women of Bath Iron Works, distinguished guests, and friends, it a pleasure to share this day of celebration with you. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Mrs. Peralta, it is an honor to join you and your family on this day of solemn remembrance and recognition of your son. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 During my service in the United States Senate, I have had the privilege of participating in many christenings here at Bath Iron Works, each one very special.\u00a0 It is appropriate to pause and reflect on the Navy\u2019s time-honored tradition of naming its ships. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Navy ships sail the globe and, where necessary, sail into battle.\u00a0 They demonstrate the strength of American power and resolve.\u00a0 It is fitting, therefore, that our ships bear the names of individuals who have displayed uncommon valor, notable commitment, unwavering sacrifice, and extraordinary service in support of these missions. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I am honored, and truly grateful, to take part in recognizing just such an individual, Sergeant Rafael Peralta, a United States Marine. As we christen DDG-115, we are reminded of these ideals that Sergeant Peralta exemplified. He answered the call to duty.\u00a0 He gave his life for freedom\u2019s cause.\u00a0 And his legacy will live on as DDG-115 conducts its missions in support of our national security. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We celebrate one of the most capable and proven warships in the world, built in a state-of-the-art facility by the industry\u2019s most skilled hands, manned by officers and crew with the highest level of training and expertise, all working as a team to meet the security challenges of the 21st Century.\u00a0 At the same time, we pay tribute to the timeless virtues of devotion to duty, courage, and sacrifice. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Sergeant Peralta\u2019s heroism and courage under fire are well-known to all here today.\u00a0 On November 15, 2004, during the Second Battle of Fallujah, after suffering grievous injuries, he selflessly grabbed a live grenade and absorbed the blast with his body to save the lives of his fellow Marines.\u00a0 It is an inspiring story of astonishing valor. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But remarkable as that courageous action was, it is only part of the story of a lifedevoted to accomplishment and service.\u00a0 Sergeant Peralta\u2019s family immigrated to the United States from Mexico when he was a boy.\u00a0 As a young man, he took on the responsibilities as head of the household after the passing of his father.\u00a0 He joined the Marines after high school and became an American citizen.\u00a0 In his bedroom in the family home, he hung three things: a copy of the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and his Marine boot camp graduation certificate. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 These documents reflect not only his character, but also his devotion to our nation. So does another document, a letter Sergeant Peralta wrote to his younger brother, Ricardo, as Rafael was being deployed to Iraq.\u00a0 That letter contained these words: \u201cBe proud of me, bro ...and be proud of being an American.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To Rosa Maria, Deborah, Icela (iss-SELLA), Ricardo, and all of the other members of this wonderful family, this is the gift you helped create, the character you helped forge.\u00a0 You have suffered a terrible loss.\u00a0 It is my deepest hope that your hearts are strengthened by the prayers of a grateful nation. To the Marines here today, thank you so much for coming together to honor this life.\u00a0 When that life ended, you reached out to Sergeant Peralta\u2019s grieving family with uncommon kindness and generosity.\u00a0 Like him, like all Marines, you are always faithful. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To the men and women of Bath Iron Works, you make \u201cBath built is best built\u201d not just a slogan, but a way of life.\u00a0 Your skill, commitment to excellence, and perhaps most important, your hearts, go into every ship built here.\u00a0 I am certain that the namesake of DDG 115 inspired you as you built this magnificent ship. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To the officers and crew of the Rafael Peralta, I know that the men and women of the United States Navy take great pride in the namesakes of their ships.\u00a0 You serve on a ship that represents the highest values of our nation and our armed forces.\u00a0 Your motto, \u201cFortis ad Finem\u201d perfectly describes Sergeant Peralta.\u00a0 Like him, I am certain you will be brave, even to the end. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Wherever the Rafael Peralta sails, the spirit of this valiant Marine will go with her.\u00a0 May she have fair winds and following seas, and may God always speed her safely home."},

If the VA sunsets the program as proposed in the report, the consolidation plan leaves many questions and details that must be explained to ensure there is continuity in care for veterans who currently utilize the program. Since 2011, the ARCH pilot program has been operating in five rural sites across the country. ARCH serves rural veterans by giving them access to health care from a community provider close to home instead of traveling several hours to seek care at a VA facility. The inclusion of a two-year extension of the ARCH program in the Choice Act helped to make certain rural veterans were able to continue accessing timely, high-quality care closer to home. Senators Collins, King, and Moran have been advocates for improved accessibility to health care for rural veterans through the ARCH program.

The defense appropriations bill provides funding critical to Maine jobs and to our national security.  \u201cto fail to do so just days before we honor our veterans would be a grave disserve to those who serve in our military today.\u201d  \u201csupporting an individual appropriations bill in no way suggests that the Senate is giving up on passing the other 11 subcommittee appropriations bills, whether they are brought to the floor individually or as an Omnibus package.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWe have a budget agreement. A bipartisan, bicameral budget agreement. I do not understand why we cannot move forward with the defense appropriations bill, other appropriations bills, and ultimately an omnibus bill.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Unfortunately, this legislation was blocked by Senate Democrats this morning for the third time (51-44). \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thank you, M. President.\u00a0 I come before the Senate to express my strong support for proceeding to the FY 2016 Defense Appropriations bill.\u00a0 This bill provides vital funding for the men and women of our armed services at a time of serious and growing threats to our own national security and at a time of troubling instability and violent conflicts in many countries around the world.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Proceeding would allow the Senate an opportunity to debate defense funding in an open and transparent manner and to meet our constitutional obligations. Mr. President, I am perplexed to hear some of my dear friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle suggest that there is a Republican plan to enact only the Defense Appropriations bill and then proceed to a Continuing Resolution for the other appropriations bills.\u00a0 It would be an understatement to say that Continuing Resolutions are certainly not the preferred option of the Appropriations Committee, and I say that as a proud member of that committee.\u00a0 Continuing Resolutions create uncertainty, they lock in last year\u2019s priorities, and continue to fund programs that should be eliminated. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They are not effective ways to govern.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I want to be clear, supporting an individual appropriations bill in no way suggests that the Senate is giving up on passing the other 11 subcommittee appropriations bills, whether they are brought to the floor individually or as an Omnibus package.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Members of the Appropriations Committee now have working numbers as a result of the budget agreement. We are working together in a bipartisan, bicameral manner, diligently to craft a bipartisan Omnibus that can be supported by both Chambers. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Democrats and Republicans came together to pass a budget agreement just a few short days ago, and our ongoing negotiations prove our sincerity and determination to move ahead with individual bills and in crafting an Omnibus bill.\u00a0 We have already made great progress this year.\u00a0 As our Chairman Cochran has noted previously, this is the first time in six years that the Appropriations Committee has approved all twelve of its bills. And many of those bills due to the leadership on the Democratic side, by dear friend Barbara Mikulski and others, have been bi-partisan when they were reported by our committee. And I would note that we completed our work despite terribly strict budget constraints months ago.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Now we are in a new stage. We have a bipartisan two year budget agreement that has provided some much needed relief to some of the budget caps while keeping us on a fiscally responsible path. Mr. President, this is the third time that the Senate has attempted to take up this vital appropriations bill. Last time, my democratic friends objected because there was no bipartisan bicameral budget agreement. In the absence of such an agreement they said could not proceed with a bill. Now I didn\u2019t agree with that rationale, but I understood it. I do not understand the situation we find ourselves in today. We have a budget agreement. A bipartisan, bicameral budget agreement. I do not understand why we cannot move forward with the defense appropriations bill, and ultimately an omnibus bill. Next year due to this budget agreement, I hope we can bring each and every one of the individual appropriations bills before the Senate, for debate and amendment, the way we use to do so and that is our goal.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 December 11 is quickly approaching, and that is the date when the current Continuing Resolution expires. We must act before then to ensure the federal government remains open. We must act to ensure that vital federal programs are funded and not operating under yet another continuing resolution, which is such poor policy. That is what we are trying to prevent. Let\u2019s get the Defense Appropriations bill approved, then I hope we can bring up at least one or two, perhaps three other appropriations bills, and in the meantime we are already working on an omnibus bill. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As Chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies, I have already met with my Ranking Member, Senator Reed, and with our House counterparts to begin the negotiations on our bill.\u00a0 We are operating under a very tight timeframe that will require Members to work around the clock and a good faith effort from all sides. And that is what I am asking for today: for members on the other side of the aisle to take the majority leader, the Republican leader, at his word. To pass this bill. This vitally needed bill. To go onto a second individual appropriations bill all the while we are working in a bipartisan way to craft an omnibus bill.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 M. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the importance of advancing FY 2016 appropriations bills.\u00a0 Let me reiterate, it is simply wrong for any of my Democratic colleagues to assume that proceeding to the Defense bill somehow suggests that there is no interest by our Leader in passing an Omnibus that will include the other bills funding essential education, bio-medical research, transportation, housing, agricultural energy, environmental and other important programs.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I urge my colleagues to support proceeding to the bill.\u00a0 To fail to do so, once again for the third time, despite the existence of the budget framework that we have agreed to, to fail to do so just days before we honor our veterans would be a grave disserve to those who serve in our military today."},

Each of them helped to forge the character of such a patriot.\u00a0 On Veterans Day, we also pay tribute to the parents, the wives and husbands, the children, and the other loved ones of our veterans and our troops.\u00a0 The families of those who serve face the challenges of carrying on with their day-to-day lives while suffering from pain caused by separation and worry, and, as with the Peralta family, often the grief of loss.\u00a0 Their sacrifices are great, and we thank them as well. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A large contingent of Marines attended the christening to remember their fallen comrade.

This may cause them to limit their activities, resulting in reduced mobility and physical activity and even further increasing their risk of falling. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This trend can be reversed through proven measures. \u00a0As Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I recently authored a bipartisan resolution designating September 23, 2015 \u2013 the first day of the fall season \u2013 as Falls Prevention Awareness Day to better educate seniors, families, and caregivers \u2013 as well as government and civic organizations \u2013 about the practices, programs, and policies that can be taken to reduce the risk of falls. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As a senator representing the state with the oldest median age, I am especially concerned that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Maine is eighth in the nation in the percentage of seniors who suffer falls.\u00a0 In 2010, the average medical cost of each fall in Maine was $16,000.\u00a0 A recent news story on this issue reported that at Maine Medical Center in Portland, our state\u2019s largest hospital, the emergency department treats at least one senior who has fallen during every shift. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Mayo Clinic offers a brief checklist of simple fall-prevention strategies:"},

The Portman-Warner bill would fill that gap by authorizing the president to bring independent agencies into the same analysis and review process that governs other regulators.\u00a0\u00a0 The need for this reform is obvious.\u00a0 According to government records, out of the 18 major final rules issued by independent agencies in 2013, not one was based on a complete, quantified cost-benefit analysis.\u00a0 The same was true in 2012\u2014 18 major rules, zero with a complete cost-benefit analysis.\u00a0 The figure was 17 and zero in both 2011 and 2010.

This important bipartisan legislation is vital to ensuring our national security. \u00a0While passage of the NDAA is an essential step toward securing our national security objectives, I am concerned that some of my colleagues in the Senate continue to block the advancement of the FY 2016 Defense Appropriations Bill.\u00a0 I am also concerned by the President\u2019s recent announcement of a veto threat, despite the significant bipartisan support for this bill.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThis legislation affirms the strategic importance of our Navy and shipbuilding programs by fully funding the DDG-1000 Program and authorizing $400 million toward an additional DDG-51 beyond those included in the current multiyear procurement contract.\u00a0 This bill also maintains investments in our public shipyards, which are strategic facilities in our national security arsenal,\u201d   \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOur Navy fleet provides the robust forward presence our nation requires to respond to humanitarian disasters, project force, and protect critical trade routes that facilitate global commerce and security.\u00a0 The DDG-1000 is the lead ship of its class and will bolster our ability to project power.

That resolution recognized the need for action by all nations to promote human rights and education opportunities for girls around the world and to combat the discrimination and abuse they suffer too often in too many places. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On Oct. 9, 2012 \u2013 virtually the eve of the first observance \u2013 14-year-old Malala Yousafzai, an outspoken advocate for girls\u2019 education in her home country of Pakistan, was gunned down and nearly killed by the Taliban while she was on her way to school. Malala recovered from her wounds and courageously continued and even expanded her fight. In 2014, she became the youngest-ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whether the timing of that heinous attack was coincidental or planned, it illustrates a challenge that must be addressed: while the majority of the world\u2019s people support a full measure of rights and opportunities for girls, there remain dark forces committed to violence and oppression. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The theme of the 2015 International Day of the Girl Child is \u201cThe Power of the Adolescent Girl: Vision for 2030.\u201d The UN is calling upon governments and the private sector worldwide to commit to an ambitious 15-year agenda of investment in education and job-training for girls and to a zero tolerance policy for physical, mental, and sexual violence. This violence includes sex trafficking and forced marriage. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Girls\u2019 education is fundamental to a society\u2019s social and economic well-being as it promotes the health and welfare of the next generation. Research shows that an increase in the female share of labor-force participation results in faster economic growth, which can help developing nations rise out of poverty. The World Bank estimates that some of the poorest countries lose more than $1 billion in annual economic output by failing to educate girls to the same level as boys, and that every year of secondary school education correlates to an 18-percent increase in a girl\u2019s earning power. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yet, more than 31 million girls around the world are not in school. Nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s illiterate are women; of the 103 million youth worldwide who lack basic literacy skills, more than 60 percent are girls. For nations struggling to break the bonds of poverty, this is an enormous amount of wasted potential. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The United States is a global leader in education equality. Starting with the generation born in the 1950s, the majority of our high-school graduates have been young women. Women born in the 1960s pulled even with men in college enrollment and graduation; today, the majority of college degrees are earned by women. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 America also leads the world in promoting and supporting education equality around the world. For example, the Peace Corps has 7,000 volunteers in 60 developing countries working side-by-side with families and community leaders to break down the barriers to education for girls. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is a key partner in Africa, where one out every four girls do not receive even a basic education. Efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, and Malawi have improved education and health outcomes for more than 130,000 girls. From El Salvador to Afghanistan, USAID and our State Department are working to address the challenges confronting adolescent girls around the world. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Tragically, as the story of Malala Yousafzai makes clear, many girls are denied an education not because their country lacks the resources but because someone wants to prevent them from having it. A particularly horrifying example of this is the Boko Haram terrorist group in Nigeria, which kidnapped more than 275 girls last year and is responsible for the deaths of more than 11,000 people. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The name Boko Haram means \u201cWestern education is forbidden.\u201d This descriptive moniker helps explain the organization\u2019s determination to terrorize young girls who seek an education \u2013 girls who seek nothing more than a better life and a path to independence. And it is seeking to extend its malevolent influence to neighboring counties. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In response to the kidnapping, I led all 20 women Senators in urging Secretary of State Kerry to pursue UN sanctions against Boko Haram. Boko Haram is now subject to a complete asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo. This September, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation I introduced to strengthen our efforts against Boko Haram, including the development of a long-term diplomatic and military strategy to counter the threat. This strategy is to include bolstering the government of Nigeria\u2019s ability to protect schoolchildren and to combat gender-based violence and inequality. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Combatting oppression against women and girls and increasing their opportunities abroad has been a long-standing priority of mine. The bipartisan International Violence Against Women Act I introduced with Senator Barbara Boxer would ensure that the U.S. will take a leadership role in combating these problems. This bill would establish that it is the policy of the United States to take action to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls around the globe and to coordinate efforts to address gender-based violence into U.S. foreign policy and foreign assistance programs. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When a girl receives a quality education, she is more likely to earn a good living, raise a healthy family, and improve the quality of life for herself, her family, and her community \u2013 as well as for her country and our world. As a world leader, the United States is committed to this cause, but we must never forget that the girls of Nigeria and Malala Yousafzai were targeted simply because they went to school. We must send a message to women and girls around the world that their safety and well-being matters and that everyone deserves the opportunity to seek an education."},

Senator Collins\u2019 testimony will assist the ITC in making a final determination as to whether the unfair Canadian subsidies, including those provided to the Port Hawkesbury Paper mill in Nova Scotia, have materially injured or threatened to injure Maine\u2019s supercalendered paper industry. In her testimony before the members of the Commission, Senator Collins stated that Senator Collins first raised concern over the extensive subsides that the Port Hawkesbury mill received from Nova Scotia   which was signed by nine of her Senate colleagues. She has also raised this issue with Commerce Secretary Pritzker and Canadian officials.  continued, stating that, \u201cMadison Paper has been forced to curtail production and lay-off workers three times in the first half of 2015.\u201d In addition, the \u201coutcome of this investigation may also affect the Maine workers at Verso Paper Corporation\u2019s mill in Jay.\u201d  concluded, stating that, \u201cWhile I strongly support relief to these hardworking men and women and the companies that are being injured as a result of illegal government assistance, I want to note that it is my belief that the Department of Commerce should have reviewed all four Canadian producers of supercalendered paper to ensure a fair and accurate process\u2026The Department of Commerce should do all that it can to rectify this very unfortunate situation, which will affect other Maine workers, through the expedited review process.\u201d Chairman Broadbent and members of the Commission, I appreciate the opportunity to testify before you today on how unfair subsidies are harming American workers in the U.S. paper industry. I ask consent that my longer, written statement be included in the official record. Maine communities long dependent on paper mills are in real trouble. They need immediate relief from the unfair advantages afforded by illegal subsidies, specifically those provided to Port Hawkesbury Paper in Nova Scotia, Canada. Permit me to provide a little background. In 2011, the Port Hawkesbury mill filed for bankruptcy, halted operations, and laid off its employees. After millions of dollars were spent by the provincial government to keep the mill functioning in an idled state and to maintain its supply chain, the mill was sold in 2012 for just C$33 million. Then, a package of extensive subsidies from Nova Scotia worth approximately C$124.5 million was announced, which included numerous loans, grants, tax breaks, and reduced energy costs. This assistance served to tilt the market drastically in order to allow the once closed plant to restart, which would have been virtually impossible absent the enormous subsidies. I first raised concern over these subsidies in a 2012 letter to the United States Trade Representative, which was cosigned by nine of my Senate colleagues. I have also raised this issue with Commerce Secretary Pritzker and Canadian officials. Unfortunately, the concerns we raised back in 2012 have proven to be warranted. U.S. producers of supercalendered paper, including Madison Paper Industries in Maine, have been put at a significant competitive disadvantage since Port Hawkesbury reopened. Imports of supercalendered paper from Canada have skyrocketed. In July of 2014, the U.S. was importing nearly 24,000 tons, and just one year later that amount rose to more than 90,000 tons, causing prices and sales revenue for U.S. producers to plummet. In the last two years, the average price fell nearly 13 percent, from $830 per ton to $765 per ton. In USTR\u2019s recent National Trade Estimates, the assistance provided by Nova Scotia has been cited as a concern in our trade relationship with Canada. Madison Paper has been forced to curtail production and lay-off workers three times in the first half of 2015. The company\u2019s President, Russ Drechsel, has stated that a primary reason for these layoffs is the unfair subsidies. The outcome of this investigation may also affect the Maine workers at Verso Paper Corporation\u2019s mill in Jay\u2014Verso is the second petitioner in this case. While I strongly support relief to these hard-working American men and women and the companies that are being injured as a result of illegal government assistance, I want to note that it is my belief that the Department of Commerce should have reviewed all four Canadian producers of supercalendered paper to ensure a fair and accountable process. Reviewing all four producers, as I have urged, would ensure that relief provided through tariffs on imports, reflects the actual subsides, if any, received by each Canadian company. The Department of Commerce should do all that it can to rectify this very unfortunate situation, which will affect other Maine workers, through the expedited review process. Chairman Broadbent and members of the Commission, thank you again for the opportunity to testify today."},
{"title": "Protecting Our Families from Lyme Disease", "date": ["Posted Fri, 10/23/2015 - 00:00"], "release": "Fall is a beautiful time of year in Maine, the season for hiking, hunting, and leaf-peeping. Unfortunately, fall also is tick season and a time of increased risk of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by a bacterium transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks, also known as deer ticks. Symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and skin rash. Most cases can be treated successfully with antibiotics if addressed promptly. If left untreated, the disease can affect the joints, heart, and nervous system. More than 300,000 people were diagnosed with Lyme disease nationwide in 2014, with 96 percent of those cases concentrated in just 14 states in the Upper Midwest and Northeast. Maine has one of the highest and fastest-growing incident rates of the disease, increasing from 225 cases in 2004 to 1,169 cases last year. The reason that fall is a time of increased risk is that the immature ticks, or nymphs, that fed heavily during the late spring and early summer have now molted into adults and must feed again. Although larger and easier to spot than the tiny nymphs, they are numerous and active. Maine is fortunate to have some outstanding resources for information about ticks and Lyme disease. The University of Maine Cooperative Extension and the Maine Centers for Disease Control provide a wealth of information on their websites, including easy-to-follow printable pages on how to prevent tick bites and, should one occur, how to safely remove the tick. The Maine Medical Center Research Institute offers an on-line survey that assesses the risk of having deer ticks on your property and offers suggestions to reduce tick habitat and control the infestation. A few simple precautions can greatly lessen the risk. Wearing light-colored clothing makes it easier to see ticks, and tucking pant legs into socks and shirts in waistbands makes it harder for them to hide. Consider using a repellent or pre-treat clothing. Shower after spending time in the woods, and check yourself and children. Remember that pets don\u2019t just carry ticks -- they can get sick, too \u2013 so check them and treat with repellant. Avoid walking through areas with leaf litter \u2013 that\u2019s prime tick habitat. And hunters -- don\u2019t hang infested deer hides in your yard. If you are bitten, don\u2019t panic. From the time a tick begins feeding, it generally takes about 36 hours for the host to be infected with the Lyme bacteria. Remove the tick with tweezers of a tick spoon, being careful to remove the entire tick, and wash the bite location thoroughly. The old methods of using a lit match, petroleum jelly, or nail polish are not recommended as they may accelerate the infection process. Note the date of the bite and monitor your health conditions daily, watching out for any fever, achiness, fatigue or the telltale red ring around the bite. If symptoms do occur, see your doctor immediately. Lyme disease responds well to oral antibiotics, and the sooner treatment begins, the better. Lyme disease was long thought to be a form of juvenile arthritis and was not identified as being spread by ticks until 1976. It is still considered an emerging disease and knowledge gaps remain. For example, diagnostic methods for tick-borne illnesses have not advanced as much as they should have. Consequently, the validity and accuracy of information regarding the incidence and geographic spread of the disease may be lacking. Now, another tick-borne disease called anaplasmosis is emerging, carried by the same blacklegged tick as Lyme disease, and with symptoms that are similar in nature but often more severe. The rapid spread of these diseases is alarming and makes it is essential that federal, state, and local health agencies, public health organizations, and the scientific community work together to improve prevention and detection efforts, as well as to accelerate research to address this crucial public-health challenge. The Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act of 2015 I have co-sponsored would help ensure the necessary resources are dedicated to fighting tick-borne diseases. Since there currently are no vaccines for Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, anaplasmosis, or other tick-borne diseases, prevention and treatment are crucial. In order to mount a strong national prevention and treatment effort, the legislation would create a Tick-Borne Diseases Committee that would consist of physicians, scientists, public health leaders, health agency officials, patients, and patient advocates. This national advisory body will help bring needed focus to improved reporting methods, better diagnostic tools, and more coordinated efforts from local to federal levels. With individual precautions, we all can reduce our risk of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses, and increase our enjoyment of the outdoors. With a national effort, we can stop the spread of these devastating diseases and protect the health of all."},

This legislation would require the Secretary of State to work to advance the goals of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, an innovative public-private partnership hosted by the United Nations Foundation that was created to help create a thriving global market for clean and efficient household cooking solutions. The Alliance has the goal of enabling the adoption of clean and efficient cookstoves in 100 million homes by 2020. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThis bill aims to benefit directly some of the world\u2019s poorest people and to reduce harmful pollution that affects us all,\u201d  . \u201cIt offers a way for us to address a significant public health threat and the second-largest contributor to climate change in a way that is inexpensive, not burdensome to the people of this country, and that will benefit poor people living in developing nations.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This legislation has received strong bipartisan support from organizations throughout Maine and across our country, including from the League of Conservation Voters and the Maine Conservation Voters. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHere in Maine we are already feeling the effects of a changing climate on our health and our economy,\u201d   \u201cWarmer temperatures mean more ozone pollution and increased pollen levels, both of which are particularly dangerous for children, seniors, and people with chronic lung conditions. Maine has one of the highest asthma rates in the nation and when our air is unhealthy kids miss school, workers are out sick, and expensive emergency room visits increase. Reducing carbon pollution may be the single best thing we can do \u2013 the lowest hanging fruit \u2013 in our nation\u2019s efforts to stem the tide of climate change and make our air healthier to breathe.\u00a0 The American Lung Association in Maine applauds Senator Collins for her leadership in reducing the harmful pollution caused by dirty cook stoves.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cBreathing is essential to life, yet nearly half the world\u2019s population suffers from dangerous household air pollution from cooking on open fires or dirty, unsafe cookstoves,\u201d  \u201cReplacing old, polluting stoves with modern versions that emit far less soot will directly benefit the world\u2019s poorest people, especially women and girls, and reduce the risk of devastating diseases like lung cancer. Doing so will also help reduce carbon pollution that\u2019s driving climate change. We appreciate the bipartisan leadership of Senators Collins and Durbin in proposing this legislation.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cExposure to smoke from household cooking fires in the developing world kills more than 4 million people around the world every year, exceeding deaths from malaria, HIV/AIDS, and TB,\u201d  . \u201cWe thank Senator Collins and Senator Durbin for their efforts to raise awareness and resources to address this global health issue, and to promote the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstove\u2019s market based approach to foster the design, development, and adoption of clean cooking solutions.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Nearly half the world's population cooks over open fires or inefficient, polluting and unsafe cookstoves using agricultural waste, coal, dung, wood, or other solid fuels. Smoke from these traditional stoves and open fires is associated with chronic and acute diseases and affects women and children disproportionately. The black carbon from these traditional cookstoves also creates serious environmental problems. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The World Health Organization found that in 2012 this type of air pollution claimed 4.3 million lives. Millions more are sickened from the toxic smoke, and thousands suffer burns annually from open fires or unsafe cookstoves and fuels. In addition, the Global Burden of Disease Study of 2010 doubled the mortality estimates for exposure to smoke from cookstoves, referred to as household air pollution, from two million to four million deaths annually\u2014more than the deaths from malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS combined.\u00a0 This same study ranks household air pollution as the fourth worst overall health risk factor in the world and as the second worst health risk factor in the world for women and girls.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Recent studies show that emissions of black carbon, or common soot, from these cookstoves significantly contribute to regional air pollution and climate change.\u00a0 Black carbon emissions from residential cookstoves in developing countries are responsible for as much as 25 percent of black carbon emissions.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The collection of cooking fuel is also a burden that is shouldered disproportionately by women and children.\u00a0 In some areas, women and girls risk rape and gender-based violence during the up to 20 hours per week they spend away from their families gathering fuel.\u00a0 This often means that women and girls have far less time to generate income, pursue an education, or participate in other community activities, and this marginalizes their role in society.\u00a0 A new report by the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that the world economy could increase by between 12 and 28 trillion dollars over ten years if the participation of women were to equal that of men."},

Students at our colleges and universities are depending on us for the assistance that this vital and proven program provides,\u201d The Federal Perkins Loan is a low-interest loan that helps undergraduate and graduate students with demonstrated financial need meet the costs of higher education. Senator Collins remains committed to the broad reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, but in the short term, the Senate must immediately take action to prevent any lapse in the critical assistance provided to student borrowers. Last week, Senator Collins, along with U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Rob Portman (R-OH), and Robert P. Casey, Jr. (D-PA), introduced a Senate resolution urging that the Federal Perkins Loan Program be extended.  Mr. President, I rise to support reauthorizing the Perkins Loan Program, which will expire tomorrow, September 30th, if the Senate does not act. Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed legislation \u2013 the Higher Education Extension Act \u2013 to extend this vital program for one year. I urge my Senate colleagues to support this legislation and send it immediately to the President for his signature. I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Baldwin, Casey, and Portman, for their leadership in highlighting the importance of this program, and I am pleased to join them in introducing the Senate Resolution urging its extension. Since 1958, the Perkins Loan Program has helped make college affordable for millions of students who have financial need. In Maine, more than 5,000 students received a Perkins Loan last year, providing $9.2 million in aid. Last Friday, I had a conversation with the President of the University of Maine who told me just how critical Perkins loans are to UMaine students. Mr. President, Perkins Loans are a critical part of a college\u2019s and student\u2019s financial aid resources.

A Perkins Loan can meet that additional need so that students don\u2019t have to borrow through private or higher-cost loans and can remain in school. Perkins borrowers are predominantly from lower-income families. For example, at the University of Maine last year, 64 percent of Perkins borrowers had a family income of $40,000 or less. The Perkins Loan program is campus-based, which means that participating colleges and universities administer the loans. When students graduate, they make payments directly to their college or university, and those payments are used to make new loans to other students through a revolving fund. These revolving funds are a combination of a federal contribution and an institutional match. Congress has not appropriated funds to the Perkins Loan Program since 2004, but institutions continue to be able to assist needy students through this self-sustaining program. As a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I know that our Committee is committed to the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I support that effort. In the meantime, however, we must ensure that there is not a lapse in the financial assistance provided to students. As I mentioned earlier, the House-passed bill extends the authority for the Perkins program for an additional year and does not authorize additional federal funds. Students who receive a Perkins Loan during this academic year and remain in the same academic program would be eligible to receive future Perkins Loans. Mr. President, we have only one day before the Perkins Loan Program expires. Students at our colleges and universities are depending on us for the assistance that this vital and proven program provides. I urge this my colleagues to pass the House-passed bill so that the Perkins Loan Program does not expire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record a letter from the Chancellor of the University of Maine System supporting the Perkins Loan Program."},

{"title": "Inspiring a Nation", "date": ["Posted Fri, 09/11/2015 - 00:00"], "release": "This August, Captain Kristen Griest and First Lieutenant Shaye Hayer made history when they became the first two women soldiers to complete the notoriously difficult United States Army Ranger School. Earning the right to wear the highly coveted Ranger tab is not for the faint-hearted. The rigors of the grueling course test even the strongest service members. Many try; few succeed. Only three percent of all Army troops wear a Ranger tab. This April, four hundred soldiers began the 8-week Ranger School, but only ninety-six were able to complete the full course. Last year, according to the U.S. Army, 4,057 students attempted the arduous training process, but only 1,609 were successful. Through their skill, grit, and determination, Captain Griest and Lieutenant Haver have demonstrated that character, courage, physical fitness, and tenacity are the hallmarks of extraordinary service members and leaders, and that both men and women possess these qualities. To commemorate this historic achievement and to congratulate these two soldiers, I sponsored a bipartisan Senate resolution to honor Captain Griest and Lieutenant Haver. This resolution was co-sponsored by a group of women Senators, including the senior woman Senator, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, from all parts of the country, and with views across the ideological spectrum. As we honor these women, it is important to note that 2015 was the first year that women were admitted to the Army Ranger School. This admission was part of an experiment to test whether or not women were able to physically withstand and surmount the toughness of program. This class of Army Rangers was the first integrated group. They stood shoulder-to-shoulder, enduring the course\u2019s extreme mental and physical stress, together. Each carried his or her own weight, and at times the weight of others, proving that integration represents not just a lofty goal, but an achievable reality. Their collective and individual accomplishments embody the values of our Armed Forces and our nation. As we celebrate this milestone, we must also recognize that this journey toward integration continues a history of progress. Before Captain Griest and Lieutenant Haver, the first African Americans and women who answered the call to military service laid the foundation for making integration possible. These pioneers inherently understood the importance of their contributions to the realization of full integration. They also recognized the undeniable truth that an integrated and balanced force is a successful force, both on and off the battlefield. The effectiveness of a military unit is almost always determined by the cohesion of its individual members, their dedication to the team, and their commitment to the mission. No individual service member can succeed by his or her efforts alone. Success is forged together. Captain Griest and Lieutenant Haver, along with their fellow Ranger School classmates, braved the challenges and serve as role models for girls and boys - women and men - in the United States and around the world. As a nation, we express our pride and gratitude for their personal courage and sacrifice and that of all members of our armed forces. I am confident that the military and our country are more battle-ready as a result. I am also confident that Captain Griest and Lieutenant Haver will continue to serve with distinction as they \u201cLead the Way!\u201d as our nation\u2019s newest United States Army Rangers."},

{"title": "Commitment, Service, And Patriotism", "date": ["Posted Fri, 08/07/2015 - 13:32"], "release": "Honoring the 70th Anniversary of World War II On August 14, 1945, World War II came to an end. The official ceremony aboard the battleship USS Missouri two weeks later was brief, barely 18 minutes long. The low-key nature of the event stood in stark contrast to the unprecedented horror and violence of the preceding years, years in which the fate of civilization itself hung in the balance. It is said that crisis builds character. For an entire generation of Americans, crisis did not build character; it revealed it. Today, we express our nation\u2019s gratitude to all veterans of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine for their service and sacrifice seven decades ago. With the perfect hindsight history books provide, the Second World War can seem today to be a series of events that followed an inevitable course from Pearl Harbor to Normandy to Iwo Jima to the deck of the Battleship Missouri. Yet those who were there, those who made that history, know that the outcome was far from certain. All that stood between humanity and the abyss of tyranny was their courage, their faith, and their devotion to duty. As the war began, the United States was not a rich or powerful country. We had only the 17th largest army in the world. Our industries were still struggling to overcome a decade of economic depression. With two great oceans as a buffer, many Americans thought the answer to aggression was isolationism. Yet when the crisis came, Americans responded. More than 16 million American men put on the uniforms of our armed forces. More than 400,000 died wearing those uniforms. Thousands of American women also put on the uniform, serving \u2013 and dying \u2013 in field hospitals and in such dangerous work as ferrying aircraft from production plant to airfield. They rolled up their sleeves and turned the factories of a peacetime economy into the arsenal of democracy. Throughout the country, Americans of all ages worked and saved and rationed and sacrificed as never before. Families planted victory gardens -- 20 million of them, producing 40 percent of the nation's vegetables in backyards and on rooftops. Two out of every three citizens put money into war bonds. The people of Maine were part of this great endeavor. Some 80,000 Mainers served in World War II, more than any previous war. More than 2,500 laid their lives upon the altar of freedom. I have had the honor of meeting many of Maine\u2019s heroes. Edward Dahlgren of Perham \u2013 just a few miles from my hometown of Caribou \u2013 fought his way through Italy, France, and Germany, and received the Medal of Honor for his astonishing rescue of a trapped American platoon. Charles Shay, a member of the Penobscot Nation, was among the first wave ashore at Omaha Beach and the first Native American to be awarded the Legion of Honor medal, France\u2019s highest tribute. Bert Skinner of Belfast answered the call for volunteers for the extremely dangerous mission of serving behind enemy lines with Merrill\u2019s Marauders in Burma. Through his uncommon service to his community and to his fellow veterans, Galen Cole of Bangor has kept the promise he made to himself on a battlefield in Germany in early 1945. Maine women served with distinction. Patricia Chadwick Ericson of Houlton stepped forward to serve as a Women\u2019s Airforce Service Pilot, or WASP, flying newly-built aircraft from the factories to combat zones. Mary Therese Nelson of Indian Island was the first Native American woman from Maine to enlist in the Marine Corps. Each of the stories of the men and women from Maine are unique, yet they are united by valor and devotion to duty. On the home front, Maine was on the front lines. Eighty-two destroyers were built at Bath Iron Works during the war, more than the entire Japanese output. The South Portland shipyard launched 274 Liberty ships that carried troops and arms overseas. More than 70 submarines were built at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, with three of those vital warships launched on the same day. Maine\u2019s seafaring heritage contributed greatly to the Merchant Marine, and at least 60 Mainers lost their lives to enemy attack. The Coast Guard and the Civil Air Patrol protected our shores against Nazi U-boats and saboteurs. These men and women did not come from a society steeped in militarism and the lust for conquest. Whether they came from our cities, farms or fishing villages of Maine, they came from places that desired peace and that cherished freedom. When the crisis came, the American character bound the Greatest Generation together in a great common cause on behalf of humanity. I am fortunate to be a daughter of that generation. One of my earliest childhood memories is going with my father to the Memorial Day parade in our hometown. He hoisted me high above his head and from the best vantage point along the route \u2013 my father\u2019s shoulders \u2013 I saw hats go off and hands go over hearts as Caribou paid its respects to our flag and honored our veterans. Some Memorial Days, my father would wear his Army jacket to the parade. As a child, I thought it was just an old jacket. Only as an adult did I learn the price he had paid for it. Donald Collins enlisted in the Reserve Corps as a college freshman in November of 1943 and was called to active duty in the United States Army before the year\u2019s end. He saw action in the European Theater and fought at the Battle of the Bulge. He earned the Combat Infantry Badge, two Purple Hearts, and the Bronze Star. Sergeant Collins was discharged in January of 1946. Then he did what truly distinguishes the men and women of America\u2019s armed forces. He came home, gratefully and modestly. He never talked much about his sacrifice and the hardships of war. Instead, he worked hard raising six children, running a business, serving as Scout leader, Rotarian, Mayor, and State Senator. From the strong shoulders of those like him who defended our freedom, all Americans learn about commitment, service, and patriotism. We learn that the burden of service must be borne willingly. We learn that challenges must be met and threats must be confronted. We learn that the mantle of hero must be worn with humility. It is because of the quiet courage of those who serve our country that we take those lessons to heart and resolve to pass them on to the generations to come. On this 70th anniversary of victory in World War II, let us recommit ourselves to the spirit that guided our nation through its darkest days and that lights our way into the future."},

{"title": "Caring For Our Caregivers", "date": ["Posted Fri, 08/14/2015 - 11:26"], "release": "There are more than 40 million individuals in our nation who know all too well the compassion, commitment, and endurance that it takes to be a caregiver of a loved one. They also know the frustration and exhaustion that often results.\u00a0 Our caregivers devote their time and attention, and they frequently must make many personal and financial sacrifices to ensure that their loved ones have the care they need day in and day out.\u00a0 Most important, America\u2019s caregivers enable many of our nation\u2019s seniors to remain living in the safety and comfort of their own homes. Basic demographics illustrate some of the challenges faced by our family caregivers.\u00a0 Simply put, our nation is aging. According to the Census Bureau projections, 21 percent of our population will be 65 and older by 2040, up from just under 14 percent in 2012. \u00a0Every day, 10,000 baby boomers celebrate their sixty-fifth birthdays, and many of them have chronic health conditions.\u00a0 Americans 85 and older are the fastest growing segment of our population.\u00a0 This is the very population that is most at risk of multiple and interacting health problems that can lead to disability and the need for round-the-clock care. At the very time that our population is aging and the need for care and support is increasing, declining birthrates mean that the population of caregivers is shrinking. \u00a0In Maine, where we already are the oldest state in the nation by median age, this trend poses a particular challenge. Today, there are seven potential caregivers for each person over 80 and at the highest risk of requiring long-term care.\u00a0 By 2030, there will be four, and by 2050, the number drops to fewer than three.\u00a0 As a consequence, more people will have to rely on fewer caregivers Families will likely continue to be the most important source of support for people with long-term care needs.\u00a0 In 2013, family caregivers provided an estimated $470 billion in uncompensated long-term care\u2014in Maine alone, that estimate is $2.2 billion. Family caregivers face tremendous challenges.\u00a0 The typical family caregiver is a 49-year- old woman who takes care of an older relative and in some cases, they are also caring for children.\u00a0 Thirty-four percent of family caregivers, however, are seniors age 65 or older.\u00a0 Nearly one in ten is 75 or older.\u00a0 Many of these caregivers are putting their own health at risk, since caregivers experience high levels of stress and have a greater incidence of chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer, and depression. family caregivers are employed and struggle to balance their work and caregiving responsibilities.\u00a0 Nearly seven in ten caregivers report making sacrifices in the workplace because of their caregiving responsibilities.\u00a0 Family caregivers age 50 and older who leave the workforce to care for a parent lose, on average, nearly $304,000 in wages and benefits over their lifetime. As a nation, we must do more to care for our family caregivers. I have introduced bipartisan legislation, which has been endorsed by the AARP and the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop a national strategy to support family caregivers.\u00a0 Titled the Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage, or RAISE, Family Caregivers Act, the legislation is based on a recommendation of the bipartisan Commission on Long Term Care.\u00a0 It is modeled after a law that I co-authored in 2010 with then-Senator Evan Bayh that created a coordinated strategic national plan to combat Alzheimer\u2019s disease that has made a real difference in our fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The RAISE Act directs HHS to establish a National Family Caregiving Project to develop and sustain a national strategy to support family caregivers.\u00a0 The bill would create a Family Caregiving Advisory Council composed of relevant federal agencies and non-federal members.\u00a0 It would include family caregivers, older adults with long-term care needs, individuals with disabilities, employers, health and social service providers, advocates for family caregivers, state and local officials, and others with expertise in family caregiving. The Advisory Council would be charged with making recommendations to HHS. The strategy and plan would be updated annually to reflect new developments.\u00a0 The plan would include an initial inventory and assessment of federally funded caregiver efforts.\u00a0 It would then identify specific actions that government, communities, employers, providers, and others can take to support family caregivers. The Project would be funded entirely from existing HHS funding. Family caregivers are an invaluable resource to our aging nation. Chances are that, sooner or later, we will all either be family caregivers or someone who needs one.\u00a0 We need to do more to support those who have given so much to care for a family member with significant long-term care needs."},

In her remarks titled, \u201cDisrupting the Status Quo: Can an Institutionalist Be an Agent for Change?\u201d Senator Collins discussed her bipartisan leadership in the United States Senate and her ongoing work to find compromise and achieve solutions in an increasingly polarized Congress. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Thank you, President Schott.\u00a0 I am delighted to be back at the University of Maine at Presque Isle and back home in The County.\u00a0 The great thing about coming to UMPI is that all I have to do is set my GPS for \u201cNorth of Ordinary.\u201d\u00a0 A great college has America\u2019s best college motto. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I very much appreciate seeing so many friends, neighbors, and, most of all, family members here this afternoon.\u00a0 This time of year, as we approach the potato harvest later this month, I am reminded of the strong sense of community in The County, which makes it a special place.\u00a0 We could use more of that sense of community, of working together toward common goals throughout this country, and certainly in Washington.\u00a0 The theme of this year\u2019s Distinguished Lecture Series is \u201cDisrupting the Status Quo.\u201d\u00a0 In ancient times, the phrase \u201cstatus quo\u201d was coined to describe the peace treaty between Rome and Carthage that was forged not by a battlefield victory, but by mutual agreement to restore the balance of power that existed before the war, to return to, as the translation from Latin has it, \u201cthe way things were.\u201d\u00a0 That status quo was the foundation for the rise of the Roman Republic, early democracy, and civil society. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In our times, the \u201cstatus quo\u201d has taken on a decidedly negative connotation.\u00a0 At best, today\u2019s status quo suggests a mindless adherence to something that no longer works, a resistance to innovation, opposition to needed change, the kind of stagnation that impedes progress.\u00a0 At worst, the term describes a system that is corrupt and self-serving. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 How did the status quo evolve from a system that offered both stability and progress to one that seems to block progress and at times to be rigged for the benefit of a favored few?\u00a0 And, when disruption is necessary, how shall it be done, and who shall do it? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I shall approach these important questions from my perspective as a United States Senator and ask one of my own: Can someone who reveres the institution that is the Senate \u2013 the status quo, if you will \u2013 be an agent for positive change? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I am honored to represent Maine in the Senate and proud of this great institution\u2019s historical role as the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body.\u00a0 Based on the wisdom of the ancients, the brilliance of the Enlightenment, and the genius of our Founders, the Senate is an institution designed to promote civility, conciliation, and compromise.\u00a0 It is a place designed to protect and to give a fair hearing to minority views and where raw political power is to give way to statesmanship.\u00a0 It is often referred to as a \u201cclub,\u201d but I think of it as a diverse community where leaders are supposed to work together for the common good. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That is an ideal we have seen carried out by the great Senators of the past, like Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and Arthur Vandenberg.\u00a0 It is an ideal that we have embraced in Maine by sending thoughtful and respected leaders to Washington like Margaret Chase Smith, Ed Muskie, Bill Cohen, George Mitchell, and Olympia Snowe. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As George Washington said, the Senate is supposed to be the \u201ccooling saucer\u201d for the hot tea of political passions.\u00a0 In the 18 years I have served in the Senate, however, I have witnessed a withering of this culture.\u00a0 Ideology and partisanship dictate far too much of the conduct.\u00a0 Obstructionism is too often employed for its own sake.\u00a0 Base motives are imputed to reasonable policy differences, causing legitimate differences to evolve into bitter personal disputes.\u00a0 The cooling saucer more and more resembles an overheated skillet. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I believe in the Senate as an institution.\u00a0 Like all institutions, it is a collection of unique individuals \u2013 100 in our case \u2013 each with our own backgrounds, experiences, interests, and passions.\u00a0 At its best, these disparate personalities can work together for the good of our nation because of Senate traditions \u2013 rules that guarantee open and civil debate, clearly defined procedures for amendments, and respectful debate reinforced by a rule that prohibits attacking another Senator\u2019s integrity on the Senate floor.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When either party tramples on the rights of the minority, that carefully constructed framework is undermined.\u00a0 And when the President usurps the role of Congress by overreaching in his use of executive orders or by avoiding the Senate confirmation process through recess appointments, the balance of power enshrined in our Constitution is undermined. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 These traditions are based on one central principle, that democracy is achieved through a deliberate process, not through shortcuts, insults, or manipulation.\u00a0 No matter how noble the policy goal, no matter how frustrating the process, that is the way our system is supposed to work. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Yet the Senate, like so many institutions in our society, is broken.\u00a0 Despite some encouraging signs of progress this year in the Senate\u2019s operations and achievements, the far left and the far right still make the most noise and grab the attention, but accomplish little.\u00a0 Little wonder, then, that polls show that the public\u2019s trust in America\u2019s most important public institutions is at all-time lows.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And Congress is the lowest of all.\u00a0 In fact, one poll showed that Congress\u2019 approval rating among the American people is in the single digits \u2013 ranking below colonoscopies and root canals.\u00a0 At least those two procedures come with anesthetics.\u00a0 We are paying a steep price for forsaking the principles that guide our institutions. \u00a0This point was wonderfully made in an essay a few years ago by former Congressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana.\u00a0 In 2004, I had the privilege of working closely with Lee when he was co-chairman of the 9/11 Commission and I was Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee.\u00a0 Our work together produced the landmark Intelligence Reform legislation that has helped to prevent another 9/11. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 His essay is titled, \u201cWhy Congress Needs Institutionalists.\u201d\u00a0 Here is an especially powerful passage: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201c(W)hat an institutionalist values above all else is the role that Congress plays in making our representative democracy viable.\u00a0 It should not be merely a body of elected officials, each pursuing his or her own goals or banding together to advance one political party's interests.\u00a0 Rather, Congress has a set of responsibilities laid out in the Constitution and developed over the 220 years of its existence that enable it to serve as the place where the American people come closest to touching their national government.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And, at a time when Washington seems consumed by gridlock and hyperpartisanship, and ever more distant from the people it is intended to serve, former Congressman Hamilton provides a striking answer to the question of whether institutionalists can be agents for change.\u00a0 Consider his greatly abbreviated scorecard of what past Congresses have accomplished, of the extraordinarily positive change brought about when Congress has carried out its responsibilities:\u00a0 land-grant colleges, the GI Bill, the interstate highway system, Medicare, Medicaid, the civil-rights legislation of the 1960s.\u00a0 It is truly astonishing that the institutionalists dominate the scoreboard, yet the insurrectionists get all the headlines. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Let me give you an example.\u00a0 In February of 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin gave one of the most infamous speeches in American history.\u00a0 His speech was a tirade of baseless accusation, fear-mongering, and name-calling.\u00a0 His intent was to stifle our freedoms and to turn Americans against each other. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 On June 1 of that year, Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith went to the Senate floor to deliver her famous \u201cDeclaration of Conscience.\u201d\u00a0 She did not do so to demonize Senator McCarthy as a person \u2013 as tempting as that probably was \u2013 but instead to denounce his actions.\u00a0 She certainly gave him great offense, but she spoke the truth about his tactics of ruining reputations, crushing free speech, and smearing his opponents.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Just as important, when she condemned the accusations of \u201ccommunist\u201d and \u201cfascist\u201d that were flying about the Senate chamber, she was addressing both sides of the aisle.\u00a0 It was an incredibly bold move that resonated with the American people and helped to bring the Senate back to its senses and to its principles as an institution.\u00a0 Americans again felt the touch of what President Lincoln used to refer to as \u201cthe better angels of our nature.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 History has judged these two approaches and declared a clear winner.\u00a0 In 1950, Senator McCarthy was a household name, whereas Senator Smith was a freshman.\u00a0 Today, Senator Smith is revered as a model of leadership who left a remarkable record of accomplishment.\u00a0 Senator McCarthy is but a sad chapter in our history who left only a scar. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I mentioned my work on the Intelligence Reform law; let me elaborate.\u00a0 That difficult, sweeping legislation was written, debated, and passed in the midst of a highly contentious presidential campaign year.\u00a0 It was subject to some 300 amendments, all given full consideration.\u00a0 In the end, it prevailed in the Senate by a vote of 96 to 2.\u00a0\u00a0 My great partner in that endeavor, Senator Joe Lieberman, and I succeeded not by strong-arming the opposition, but by carefully considering all points of view and defending our bill \u2013 in other words, by honoring the traditions of the Senate. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The power of time-honored legislative traditions was also clear in our efforts to repeal \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d in 2010.\u00a0 I joined Senator Lieberman in leading the fight to repeal this law that prevented patriotic gay and lesbian Americans from serving in the armed forces unless they concealed their sexual orientation.\u00a0 My view was that we ought to be expressing our gratitude to those willing to serve, not drumming them out of our armed forces. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Keep in mind that \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d was signed into law by a Democratic President, Bill Clinton, in 1993 and enjoyed bipartisan support for many years. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Discrimination was the status quo, and it needed to be disrupted.\u00a0 This change in the status quo would be difficult and was going to require Republican and Democratic votes and a change in the military\u2019s culture. \u00a0 Although it was just five years ago, outright repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d was still controversial in 2010.\u00a0 For example, while the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified in favor of repeal, the Commandant of the Marine Corps was strongly opposed to repealing this 17-year-old discriminatory law.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a contentious debate that May, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 16 to 13 to include repeal in the defense bill \u2013 not exactly an overwhelming vote.\u00a0 At the time, I was the only Republican to vote in favor of repeal.\u00a0 But I was optimistic that, ultimately, I could convince other Republicans to join me, and they did. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In December, during the final days of the legislative session, the giant defense bill, which included the repeal provisions, was brought up on the Senate floor.\u00a0 But dysfunction in the Senate and disagreement over amendments stalled the defense bill and almost killed repeal of DADT.\u00a0 We appeared to be stymied. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Senator Lieberman and I talked about how to respond to this big setback.\u00a0\u00a0 We decided to introduce a separate bipartisan bill to repeal DADT. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But the clock was ticking, and we were worried about how we would get our bill brought to the Senate floor.\u00a0 That weekend, the Assistant Democratic Leader from the House, Steny Hoyer, called me.\u00a0 He proposed that the House, then under Democratic control, would pass a separate repeal bill but wanted a guarantee from Joe and me that we could round up a sufficient number of Republican votes to pass it in the Senate.\u00a0 I told him that I thought we could. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For the next 10 days, I worked night and day to round up Republican votes even as the clock on the 111th Congress ran down.\u00a0 Many people thought ours was an impossible task, but Senator Lieberman and I made the case persistently, one-on-one with our colleagues. \u00a0When the Senate clerk began to call the roll on our bill, I was anxious but confident that the Republican votes needed to put the bill over the top were there.\u00a0 And they were.\u00a0 The final roll call on December 20th was a filibuster-proof 65 to 31, and history was made when the bill was signed into law two days later. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My point is that, as with the civil rights legislation of 50 years ago, without bipartisan leadership, and without the votes of members of both parties, DADT would not have been repealed that year.\u00a0\u00a0 And because there was bipartisan support, there has not been any serious attempt to delay or turn back the clock on repeal.\u00a0 The institutional traditions of Congress won the day. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A clear example of the damage caused by ideological polarization occurred almost two years ago and was once again resolved by the power of bipartisan compromise. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 On October 1, 2013, a government shutdown began because Congress and the Administration failed to reach an agreement to fund the federal government for the new fiscal year that began on that date.\u00a0 It is estimated that the 16-day shutdown cost the American economy $24 billion. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hard-working people in Maine paid a high price for Washington\u2019s hyperpartisanship.\u00a0 Small businesses \u2013 such as the inns, gift shops, and restaurants \u2013 around Acadia National Park lost some $16 million, or $1 million each day, due to the closure of the park during the peak fall foliage season.\u00a0 That hurt not just the business owners, but also the wait staff, store clerks, and housekeepers.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 On Saturday, October 5, as the shutdown ended its first week, I was alone in my Senate office listening to the highly partisan debate on the Senate floor.\u00a0 All of my staff had been furloughed.\u00a0 The debate on the Senate floor consisted of a Democratic Senator followed by a Republican Senator, alternating back and forth, each blaming the other side with no one offering a solution.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I thought, \u201cThis must stop.\u201d\u00a0 I drafted a plan I believed both parties could live with, rushed over to the Senate floor, and implored my colleagues to work to end the impasse.\u00a0 I challenged both sides to come out of their partisan corners, stop fighting, and start legislating in a manner worthy of the people of this great nation. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 No sooner did I leave the Senate floor than my cellphone started ringing.\u00a0 First to call was Lisa Murkowski from Alaska who said, \u201cCount me in; I want to help.\u201d\u00a0 The next call was from Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire with much the same message.\u00a0 Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also called.\u00a0 The discerning in the room will recognize a pattern. Yes, the women led the way. We also attracted a few good men, I hasten to say. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Very quickly, I was leading a bipartisan group of seven Republicans, six Democrats, and one Independent, my Maine colleague Angus King.\u00a0 We worked night and day to come up with a compromise to reopen government. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Reaching across party lines, we broke through the partisan impasse.\u00a0 Instead of finger-pointing and blame-fixing, we offered a solution.\u00a0 It showed that the two parties could come together, negotiate, and reach an agreement in an atmosphere of mutual respect and good faith.\u00a0 I call our bipartisan group the \u201cCommon Sense Coalition,\u201d and we continue to seek solutions across the partisan divide. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Compromise is difficult, but governing without it in a democracy is impossible.\u00a0 Rather than second best, a bipartisan solution reached by honest debate and consideration of alternate viewpoints very often is not just the one with the best chance to prevail, but also the best answer.\u00a0 Often what makes a policy issue challenging is that there are valid arguments and concerns on both sides.\u00a0 In such cases, the optimal resolution accommodates the concerns of the opposing sides to the greatest extent possible. \u00a0 The Roman Republic fell because the status quo that provided stability and progress became a rigid structure that denied the basic human instinct for opportunity and liberty.\u00a0 America has thrived because our government is based upon flexible yet principled institutions that allow us to meet emerging challenges.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The examples I have provided I hope will underscore this crucial point:\u00a0 unyielding adherence to an extreme position is easy.\u00a0 It is the hard work of bringing people together to find common ground that requires determination, intellect, and courage.\u00a0 One can believe in our institutions and be passionate about the positive change, justice, opportunity, and progress that they can produce.\u00a0 This works best when we work together, when we apply that sense of community, of working to achieve common goals that I learned growing up in Aroostook County. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Thank you, and I am happy to take your questions."},
{"title": "Improving Education, Expanding Opportunity", "date": ["Posted Fri, 09/04/2015 - 00:00"], "release": "The beginning of a new school year reminds us of the vital role education plays in opening the doors of opportunity to all Americans.\u00a0 We have an obligation as a society to open those doors ever wider. This also is the time of year to express our gratitude to our educators.\u00a0 Here in Maine, we are truly fortunate to have so many dedicated teachers, administrators, staff, and school board members who work hard to ensure that every child in our State has a learning environment that is safe, welcoming, and enriching. One of my highest priorities in the Senate is to support education at all levels, including promoting early childhood education, improving our public school system for kindergarten through 12 \u00a0grade, and working to increase the affordability of\u00a0higher education.\u00a0 Since joining the Senate, I have visited more than 200 Maine schools and have seen firsthand their commitment to excellence. As a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I am encouraged by recent legislation that supports this commitment. This spring, the Committee unanimously passed the \u201cEvery Child Achieves Act,\u201d a bipartisan bill to reauthorize and reform the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also known as \"No Child Left Behind.\" On July 16, I voted for the Every Child Achieves Act when it overwhelmingly passed the Senate by a vote of 81-17. Several other amendments I cosponsored were included in the bill that passed the Senate, including support for quality after-school and summer programs through 21st Century Community Learning Center program, and literacy and arts education programming for disadvantaged students and children with disabilities. The beginning of a new school year also reminds us that we must address the rising cost of a college education that threatens to close the doors of opportunity to far too many. \u00a0\u00a0Our system of higher education is, in many ways, the envy of the world, but its benefits have not been equally available. Unfortunately, family income still largely determines whether students will pursue higher education.\u00a0 I have been a longtime advocate for Pell Grants and have consistently supported efforts to help make higher education more accessible. When I worked at Husson University in Bangor, prior to my election to the Senate, I saw first-hand the impact Pell Grants had for many of our students and their families.\u00a0 One of the first bills I introduced as a new Senator in 1997 was the College Affordability and Access Act.\u00a0 I have had many young men and women on my staff whose education and subsequent success were made possible by Pell Grants. Earlier this year, the Senate approved my bipartisan amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution to increase access to higher education by strengthening the Pell Grant program.\u00a0 It would also allow for the reinstatement of year-round Pell Grants, which would permit eligible students to receive more than one grant in a single year, assisting those who choose to accelerate their degrees by taking additional courses, including over the summer. Education has been described as \u201cnot the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a flame.\u201d\u00a0 From early education to college, Maine has many keepers of the precious flame of learning.\u00a0 I wish our educators and their students a happy and productive 2015-2016 school year."},
{"title": "Cantwell, Collins, Gillibrand, Kaine Reintroduce Apprenticeship Bill to Train the Next Generation of American Workers", "date": ["Posted Wed, 09/09/2015 - 00:00"], "release": " Today, U.S. Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Kirstin Gillibrand (D-NY) announced an updated  to help the next generation of American workers develop the skills they need to secure well-paying, high-demand jobs. The legislation also aids the United States\u2019 ongoing economic recovery by ensuring we retain our competitiveness and the most innovative workforce in the world.\u00a0\u00a0 Apprenticeship programs benefit both the company and employee, and also often lead to higher-paying jobs that help sustain the economy. The bipartisan legislation would create a $5,000 tax credit for employers to use apprenticeship programs to train workers in high-demand fields. This legislation would allow workers to gain career training in health care, manufacturing and technology industries. It would also allow veterans to receive credit for their previous military training and experience. \u201cWhen American workers have the training and skills they need, the United States is better equipped to tackle the competitive challenges and opportunities of the 21st century global economy. The Apprenticeship and Jobs Training Act creates federal incentives for businesses to invest in US workers by creating or expanding their apprenticeship programs nationally.\u00a0 These programs are a critical component to closing the skills gap in high growth industries such as healthcare, aerospace and information technology. By training a skilled workforce, we unlock significant potential and create an opportunity for workers to earn good wages,\u201d  \u201cFew issues are as important to the American people as the availability of good jobs in our communities,\u201d   \u201cI have met with numerous business owners throughout Maine who have jobs available but cannot find qualified and trained workers to fill these vacant positions.\u00a0 By helping to better connect the needs of our nation's employers with the training of our workforce, this bill will play an important role in the promotion of hiring and the creation of new good-paying American jobs.\u201d \u201cApprenticeship programs are critical to growing our nation\u2019s talented workforce,\u201d   \u201cPrograms like The Apprentice School in Newport News demonstrate how apprenticeships prepare workers for high-paying, high-skilled career fields by providing them with technical training, often at a much lower cost than traditional post-secondary education programs. I\u2019m proud to introduce this bill to encourage businesses to create apprenticeship programs, which benefit our workforce and our economy.\u201d According to a study by the Department of Labor, workers who finish apprenticeships earn an average of $240,000 more in wages over a lifetime than job seekers with similar work experience. Not only do apprenticeships provide increased wages, they are beneficial to both employers and older employees ready to retire by letting them to phase into retirement, guaranteeing a cost-effective transfer of knowledge from one generation to the next. The seamless transfer of skills is particularly essential within trade-related industries, where apprenticeships allow companies to retain expertise while developing the skills of the younger workers. In Washington state, where aerospace is a key economic driver, more than 20,000 new workers will be needed over the next decade. In addition, nearly 30 percent of current aviation workers will be eligible for retirement by 2016.There are 239 registered apprenticeship programs in Washington state that provide training in more than 350 fields ranging from assembly machinists to wind turbine technicians, according to state Department of Labor and Industries data. Specifically, the legislation would: \u00b7 Create a $5,000 tax credit for up to three years for companies that hire and pay employees enrolled in a federal- or state-registered apprentice program.\u00a0Additionally, employers participating in a multi-employer apprenticeship program, the credit rate would be $3 per hour each individual works. \u00b7 Allow senior employees near retirement to draw from pensions early if they\u2019re involved in mentoring or training new employees. Workers must be at least 55, and have reduced work hours to spend at least 20 percent of their time training or educating employees or students. \u00b7 Help veterans get into skilled jobs that match their military experience sooner by allowing credit in apprenticeship requirements for previous military training. A skilled workforce is a critical component of a productive economy, and the need for training continues to grow. In the 2013 Global Manufacturing Competitiveness Index study by Deloitte, executives ranked talent-driven innovation as the top driver of a country\u2019s ability to compete globally. However, today U.S. companies are investing just half the amount in training as a share of GDP compared to a decade ago, according to a study by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. Much of this decline comes from cost pressures and the movement of workers between companies. According to a 2011 survey by the National Association of Manufacturers, the majority of industrial companies reported a moderate to severe shortage of qualified workers."},

The average age of a first-time NIH grant recipient is 42 years old\u2014 up from 36 in 1980. And, now more biomedical PhDs linger in postdoctoral training for five to eight years before achieving research independence. Without action, talented young scientists may decide to do something else, or leave the country to pursue their research. Scientific and medical innovation depends on our ability to foster and support the best and brightest scientific minds, and our researchers deserve to know that our country stands with them. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In March 2015 testimony before Congress, NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins   the current challenges facing young researchers saying, \u201cThis is the issue that wakes me up at night when I try to contemplate the future of where biomedical research can go in the United States. They are finding themselves in a situation that is the least supportive of that vision in 50 years. They look ahead of them and see the more senior scientists struggling to keep their labs going and suffering rejection after rejection of grants that previously would have been supportive. And they wonder, 'Do we really want to sign up for that?' And many of them, regrettably, are making the decision to walk away.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The bipartisan   demonstrates a commitment to our nation\u2019s young scientists by improving opportunities for our next generation of researchers at the NIH.

{"title": "Senator Collins Announces Position on Iran Nuclear Agreement", "date": ["Posted Wed, 09/09/2015 - 00:00"], "release": " \u2013 U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, spoke from the Senate floor today to announce her opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Since the JCPOA was announced, Senator Collins has worked to inform her decision, a decision she calls \u201cone of the most important foreign policy decisions ever to face the United States Senate.\u201d Senator Collins has studied the agreement and its annexes, attended Intelligence Committee sessions and other classified briefings, questioned Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, as well as intelligence officials including the top manager for Iran. She has also spoken to United States negotiators and ambassadors, and discussed the agreement with experts of divergent views. \u201cI have long believed that a verifiable diplomatic agreement with Iran that dismantled its nuclear infrastructure and blocked its pathways to the development of a nuclear weapon would be a major achievement, an accomplishment that would make the world far safer,\u201d   \u201cRegrettably, that does not describe the agreement that the Administration negotiated. The agreement is fundamentally flawed because it leaves Iran as capable of building a nuclear weapon at the expiration of the agreement as it is today.\u201d In her remarks, Senator Collins outlined several concerns with the agreement, including: \u2022 At the expiration of the agreement, Iran will be a more dangerous and stronger nuclear threshold state \u2013 exactly the opposite of what this negotiation should have produced. \u2022 Major non-nuclear concessions have been made including an end to the embargoes on Iran obtaining intercontinental ballistic weapons (ICBM) technology and conventional weapons. Iran already has ballistic missiles that can reach Israel. An Iranian ICBM poses a direct threat to the United States. \u2022 The inspection regime is flawed and insufficient given Iran\u2019s history of non-compliance. Under this agreement, Iran would have the authority to delay inspection requests from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for 24 days. According to press reports, the Iranians themselves would also be responsible for photographs and environmental sampling of Parchin, a large military installation where nuclear work is suspected to have been conducted and may still be underway. \u2022 The snap-back of economic sanctions won\u2019t work. Iran has said that if the United States or any of its partners insist on re-imposing sanctions, it can simply walk away from the deal. \u2022 Better alternatives exist and agreements have been renegotiated before. The Senate has required changes to more than 200 treaties that were ultimately ratified after congressional concerns were addressed. Senator Collins\u2019 remarks, as prepared for delivery: President Obama\u2019s agreement with the Iranian government with respect to its nuclear program is one of the most important foreign policy decisions ever to face the United States Senate. The vote that we shall cast will not be an easy one. The security of our nation and the stability of the Middle East, as well as America\u2019s leadership in the world, are affected by this agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA. Thus, I have devoted countless hours to studying the agreement and its annexes, attending Intelligence Committee sessions and other classified briefings, questioning Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz, and our intelligence officials, including the top manager for Iran, talking with our negotiators and with ambassadors, and discussing the agreement with experts with divergent views to ensure that my decision is as well informed as possible. Let me begin by making clear that I supported the Administration undertaking negotiations with Iran. Indeed, I was heartened when President Obama initially said in October 2012 that \u201cOur goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place....\u201d He said that \u201cthe deal we'll accept is, they end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward.\u201d I was optimistic that the Administration would produce an agreement that would accomplish the goals the President laid out. Along with six other of my Republican colleagues, I did not sign a letter to the leaders of the Iranian government sent in the midst of the negotiations because I wanted to give the Administration every opportunity to complete an agreement that would accomplish the goals that the President himself originally set forth as the purpose of the negotiations. I have long believed that a verifiable diplomatic agreement with Iran that dismantled its nuclear infrastructure and blocked its pathways to the development of a nuclear weapon would be a major achievement, an accomplishment that would make the world far safer. Regrettably, that does not describe the agreement that the Administration negotiated. The agreement is fundamentally flawed because it leaves Iran as capable of building a nuclear weapon at the expiration of the agreement as it is today. Indeed, at that time, Iran will be a more dangerous and stronger nuclear threshold state -- exactly the opposite of what this negotiation should have produced. As Mark Dubowitz, a noted expert on sanctions, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: \u201cEven if Iran doesn\u2019t violate the JCPOA, \u2026 it will have patient pathways to nuclear weapons, an ICBM program, access to heavy weaponry, an economy immunized against sanctions pressure, and a more powerful regional position\u2026.\u201d Under the agreement, not a single one of Iran\u2019s 19,000 centrifuges, used to enrich uranium to produce the fissile material for a nuclear bomb, will be destroyed. And Iran will be able to continue its research and development on advanced centrifuges able to enrich uranium more rapidly and effectively. Not only will Iran retain its nuclear capability, but also it will be a far richer nation and one that has more conventional weapons and military technology than it possesses today. The lifting of sanctions will give Iran\u2019s leaders access ultimately to more than $100 billion dollars in the form of frozen assets and overseas accounts. Iran will also once again be able to sell its abundant oil on global markets. Now, the Administration has repeatedly argued that Iranian leaders will invest those billions of dollars into their own economy to improve the lives of their citizens. The record strongly suggests otherwise. Iran today is the world\u2019s foremost exporter of terrorism, pouring billions of dollars into terrorist groups throughout the region and into funding the murderous Assad regime in Syria. If Iran is financing, arming, and equipping terrorist groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, and Yemen when its own economy is in shambles and its citizens are suffering, why would anyone believe that it would invest the proceeds of sanctions relief only in its own economy? I do expect that Iran\u2019s leaders will invest in a few high-profile projects to help their own citizens, but given their history, it is inevitable that billions more will be used to finance terrorism and strengthen Iran\u2019s power and proxies throughout the Middle East. It is deeply troubling that the Administration secured no concessions at all from Iran, designated by the Director of National Intelligence as the number one state sponsor of terrorism, to cease its support of terrorist groups. Whether it is Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Shiite militias in Iraq, or the Houthis in Yemen, Iran\u2019s proxies are terrorizing innocent civilians, forcing families to flee their homes, and causing death and destruction. And incredibly, the JCPOA will end the embargos on selling Iran intercontinental ballistic missile technology and conventional weapons, which the Russians are eager to sell them. Think about that for a moment: why would Iran want to buy intercontinental ballistic missile technology? It already has the deeply troubling capability to launch missile strikes at Israel, which it has pledged to wipe off the face of the earth. ICBM technology poses a direct threat to our nation from a nation whose leaders continue to chant \u201cDeath to America!\u201d We should also remember that Iranian Quds forces were the source of the most lethal improvised explosive devices that were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of our service members in Iraq. Why would we ever agree to lifting the embargo on sales of conventional weapons that could endanger our forces in the region? Let me now turn to the issue of enforcement of the agreement by posing the obvious question: Will Iran abide by the agreement and the corresponding U.N. Security Council Resolution, or will it cheat? Despite being a signatory to the U.N. Charter, Iran has repeatedly violated or ignored the United Nations Security Council\u2019s resolutions aimed at curbing its nuclear program. In 2006, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution prohibiting Iran from enriching uranium. What happened? Iran cheated. It has literally thousands of centrifuges spinning to enrich uranium. Multiple U.N. Security Council Resolutions require Iran to cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to come clean on what is known as the \u201cpossible military dimensions\u201d of its nuclear activities to understand how far Iran has progressed in developing the technologies for a nuclear device and to have a verified baseline to evaluate future nuclear-related activities. What happened? Iran cheated. Not only did it never report to international arms control experts about experiments at its military installation at Parchin, where Iran was suspected of developing detonators for nuclear devices, but also Iran \u201csanitized\u201d buildings at Parchin in a manner that the IAEA has described as \"likely to have undermined the Agency's ability to conduct effective verification.\" Remarkably, according to public reporting, Iran continued those sanitization activities while Congress was holding hearings on the JCPOA this summer. In 2010, the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution requiring Iran to cease any activity related to ballistic missile activities capable of delivering nuclear weapons. What happened? Iran cheated. It launched ballistic missiles in July 2012. Given its history, there is no question in my mind that Iran will try to cheat on the new agreement and exploit any loophole in the text or in the implementing U.N. Security Council Resolution that was adopted before Congress even had a chance to vote on the agreement. Given Iran\u2019s history of non-compliance, one would think that an iron-clad inspection process would be put in place. That is far from the reality of this agreement. Let me make four points about how Iran can stymie inspections. First, throughout the term of the agreement, Iran has the authority to delay inspections of undeclared sites, those where inspectors from the IAEA believe that suspicious activities are occurring. Inexplicably, the JCPOA establishes up to a 24-day delay between when the IAEA requests access to a site and when access is granted. The former Deputy Director General for Safeguards at the IAEA notes that 24 days is sufficient time for Iran \u201cto sanitize\u201d suspected facilities and points out that past concealment activities carried out by Iran in 2003 left no traces to be detected. This is a long way from the \u201cany time, anywhere\u201d inspections that should have been part of the agreement. Second, no American or Canadian experts will be allowed to be part of the IAEA inspection team unless these countries re-establish official diplomatic relations with Iran. I recognize that the IAEA has many highly qualified experts, but the exclusion of some of the most highly skilled and experienced experts in the world does not inspire confidence. Third, and most outrageous, according to press reports, the Iranians themselves will be responsible for photographs and environmental sampling at Parchin, a large military installation where nuclear work is suspected to have been conducted and may still be underway. IAEA weapons inspectors will be denied physical access to Parchin. You note that I say \u201caccording to press reports.\u201d That is because the actual agreement between the IAEA and Iran is secret and has been withheld from Congress! As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have been briefed on the agreement, but like every other member of Congress, I have been denied access to the actual document despite how significant this issue is. The actual text matters because of Iran\u2019s repeated efforts to exploit loopholes. Fourth, Iran is not required to ratify the Additional Protocol (AP) before sanctions relief is granted -- if ever. The Additional Protocol allows the IAEA permanent inspection access to declared and suspected nuclear sites in a country in order to detect covert nuclear programs. Ratification of the Protocol would make the AP permanently and legally binding in Iran. One hundred twenty-six countries have already ratified it, including the United States. Yet, the agreement only requires Iran to \u201cseek ratification\u201d of the Additional Protocol in eight years and to comply with its terms until then. If Iran\u2019s past behavior is any guide, Iran may never ratify the Additional Protocol and be subject to its permanent, legally binding inspection regime. To prevent Iran from cheating, the Administration has repeatedly pointed to the prospect of an immediate snap-back of sanctions as the teeth of the agreement. I will be surprised if they work as advertised. First, the rhetoric on the snapback of sanctions is inconsistent. On the one hand, the Administration says that the United States can unilaterally cause the international sanctions to be re-imposed. At the same time, the Administration warns that the sanctions regime is falling apart. Which is it? Second, Iran has already made explicit in the text of the Agreement that the re-imposition of any sanctions will be treated as grounds to re-start its nuclear program. Included in the JCPOA is this clear statement: \u201cIran has stated that if sanctions are reinstated in whole or in part, Iran will treat that as grounds to cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part.\u201d In effect, Iran has given advance notice that if the United States or any of its partners insist on re-imposing sanctions, Iran can simply walk away from the deal. Given their investment in the deal, I am very skeptical that any of the P5+1 countries will be willing to take that action. After the U.N. Security Council endorsed the deal on July 20th, the Iranians released a statement stating that they may \u201creconsider its commitments\u201d if new sanctions impair the business and trade resulting from the lifting of nuclear sanctions, \u201cirrespective of whether such new sanctions are introduced on nuclear-related or other grounds.\u201d (emphasis added) To the Iranians, a sanction is a sanction is a sanction, and Iran appears ready to resume its nuclear activities if any sanctions are re-imposed, even if the purpose is to halt Iran\u2019s financing of terrorist groups. Third, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the agreement states that sanctions would not be applied \"with retroactive effect to contracts signed between any party and Iran or Iranian entities prior to the date of application.\" This grandfathering clause will create an immediate rush of businesses to lock in long-term business contracts with Iran. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif assured Iranian lawmakers that the \"swarming of business for reinvesting their money is the biggest barrier\" to the re-imposition of sanctions. He is right. The State Department insists that each case will be worked on an individual basis, but there is no guarantee that any case, much less every case, will be resolved in the short time period necessary. There are alternatives to the deeply flawed agreement reached in Vienna. While I recognize that it would be difficult, the fact is the Administration could renegotiate a better deal. As Orde Kittrie, the former lead State Department attorney for nuclear issues, recently noted in The Wall Street Journal, the Senate has required changes to more than 200 treaties that were ultimately ratified after congressional concerns were addressed. For example, the 1997 resolution of ratification regarding the multilateral Chemical Weapons Convention included 28 conditions inserted by the Senate. The treaty was ultimately ratified and is currently in force in 191 participating countries -- including the United States and Iran. Similarly, the Senate insisted that the Threshold Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union have additional provisions strengthening compliance measures before it was ratified. Of course, one of the problems with this agreement is that it is not in the form of a treaty, which precludes the Senate from inserting reservations, understandings, or declarations. Another alternative to this agreement would be to further wield our unilateral financial and economic power against those conducting business with key Iranian entities. As Juan Zarate, the first Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: We can\u2019t argue in the same breath that \u2018snapback\u2019 sanctions as constructed offer a real Sword of Damocles to be wielded over the heads of the Iranians for years while arguing that there is no way now for the United States to maintain the crippling financial and economic isolation which helped bring the Iranians to the table. Every country and business would have to choose whether to do business with a nuclear Iran or the United States. Most countries and businesses would make the right choice. Despite these options, the Administration negotiated a pact in which its red lines were abandoned, compromised, or diluted, while the Iranians held firm to their core principles. The Iranians have secured the following if the agreement moves forward: \u2022 broad sanctions relief, \u2022 a U.N.-blessed domestic uranium enrichment capability, \u2022 international acceptance of Iran as a nuclear threshold state, \u2022 international acceptance of its indigenous ballistic missile program, \u2022 lifting of the arms and ICBM embargos, \u2022 repeal of all the previous U.N. Security Council Resolutions, and \u2022 removal of the Iranian nuclear issue from the U.N. Security Council agenda. Accordingly, I will cast my vote for the motion of disapproval. I believe Iran will bide its time, perfect its R&D on advanced centrifuges, secure an ICBM capability, and build a nuclear weapon as the JCPOA is phased out. It is time for Congress to reject the JCPOA and for the Administration to negotiate a new agreement as has been done so many times in the past when the Senate raised serious concerns. The stakes are too high, the risks too great, to do otherwise."},

Below is the  \u00a0of their letter to Secretary Perez: September 9, 2015 The Honorable Thomas Perez Secretary United States Department of Labor 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W. Washington, DC 20210 Dear Mr. Secretary: We are writing in support of the recently filed Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) petition to assist more than 300 workers at Verso Paper Corporation in Jay, Maine, who are being displaced due in large measure to foreign competition. Shrinking demand attributable to foreign competition is forcing Verso Paper Corporation to scale back its annual production of coated paper and, consequently, its workforce. Given the rural location of the Jay mill and the closures in recent years of other paper mills in the region, the laid-off workers face an enormous hurdle in identifying and securing alternative employment. Many may require retraining for other emerging occupations, making it crucial that these workers receive certification under the TAA program. We urge that you review this Trade Adjustment Assistance application in a timely manner, consistent with all rules and regulations, to ensure that the workers receive the assistance they need to obtain work and maintain their financial stability. Thank you for your consideration on behalf of the workers at the Verso paper mill in Jay, Maine."},

There are parts of our state where Internet access is simply not available at all\u2026it\u2019s one thing to say patients should be accessing their portal\u2026it\u2019s a lot harder if you are an elderly person without a computer living in rural Maine where access to the Internet is very limited or non existent\u2026\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In response to Senator Collins\u2019 point, Mr. Dishman replied that he \u201ccould not agree more\u2026 when we go to design technologies, we focus on dual eligibles in rural parts of the country and if we can make those systems work for them and there we know there are going to work elsewhere.\u2026 We are going to need to aim these systems at probably ten different levels of health literacy and make sure that we have the tools in place\u2026\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 According to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health ITs Consumer Survey, only 28 percent of Americans were offered access to online medical records in 2013.\u00a0 Fifty-four percent didn\u2019t access their records, and 21 percent viewed them only once or twice."},

September 10, 2015 marked the 25  anniversary of the establishment of the ORWH. \"For far too long, women were being excluded from clinical research trials and women\u2019s health issues were being ignored,\u201d  said. \u201cTwenty-five years ago, women did not have much to celebrate when it came to scientific advances \u2013 we weren\u2019t even at the table. Now researchers look at disease in a gender-specific way, and we've made great strides in breast cancer and cervical cancer research, AIDS research, and mapping the human genome. We\u2019ve changed that paradigm, but we\u2019re not done yet. We must continue to raise awareness, raise consciousness and raise hell so that women are not left behind when it comes to their health.\u201d \u00a0\u201cFor the last twenty-five years, the NIH Office of Research on Women\u2019s Health (ORWH) has led the charge in increasing scientific understanding and personalized treatment for women across the country and around the world,\u201d said  . \u201cI am pleased to join with Senator Mikulski in leading this bipartisan resolution that honors this important milestone and champions the continued importance of the inclusion of women\u2019s health in NIH research.\u201d  and   are longtime advocates of women\u2019s health and supporters of scientific research. In 1990,   and a group of her women colleagues drove together to NIH in Bethesda, Maryland. Their goal was to assemble key government health officials to address concerns regarding women\u2019s exclusion from clinical research. As a result of this meeting, Senator Mikulski and her colleagues were able to build support for the ORWH and successfully worked to establish and fund the Office at NIH. The ORWH has made significant progress in developing and implementing policies to ensure the inclusion of women in NIH clinical research. The Office\u2019s research efforts benefit all individuals with diseases and disorders studied by researchers, including men, women, older and younger adults, children and minority populations. ORWH-supported research has dramatically increased understanding of the importance of gender specific research, and has spurred policy change and programs focused on the health of girls, women and their families. Today, more than half of participants in NIH-funded clinical trials are women. The ORWH now works in partnership with NIH\u2019s 27 Institutes and Centers to ensure that women\u2019s health research continues to be a part of the scientific framework at NIH and throughout the scientific community. In addition to   and  , the bipartisan resolution is cosponsored by  ,  ,  ,    ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,    and . Celebrating the 25  anniversary of the Office of Research on Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health. Whereas, on September 10, 1990, the Office of Research on Women's Health (in this resolution referred to as `ORWH') was established at the National Institutes of Health (in this resolution referred to as `NIH') to-- (1) ensure that women were included in NIH-funded clinical research; (2) set research priorities to address gaps in scientific knowledge; and (3) promote biomedical research careers for women; Whereas ORWH was established in law by the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-43; 107 Stat. 122) and implemented the law requiring researchers to include women in NIH-funded tests of new drugs and other clinical trials; Whereas, today, more than 1/2 of the participants in NIH-funded clinical trials are women, enabling the development of clinical approaches to prevention, diagnosis, or treatment appropriate for women; Whereas, in 2015, ORWH, with enthusiastic support from NIH leadership, announced that, beginning in January 2016, NIH-funded scientists must account for the possible role of sex as a biological variable in vertebrate animal and human studies; Whereas ORWH, along with NIH leadership, enhances awareness of the need to adhere to principles of rigor and transparency, including the need to publish sex-specific results to inform the treatment of women, men, boys, and girls; Whereas, over the past 25 years, ORWH has helped expand research on women's health beyond its roots in reproductive health to include-- (1) the study of the health of women across the lifespans of women; and (2) biomedical and behavioral research from cells to selves; Whereas, by studying both sexes, ORWH is leading the scientific community to make discoveries headed toward treatments that are more personalized for both women and men; Whereas, today, ORWH communicates through programs and policies that sex and gender affect health, wellness, and how diseases progress; Whereas turning discovery into health for all, the NIH motto, means studying both females and males across the biomedical research continuum; Whereas the ORWH Specialized Centers of Research on Sex Differences program supports established scientists who do basic, clinical, and translational research with a sex and gender focus; Whereas all NIH Institutes and Centers fund and encourage scientists at universities across the Nation to conduct research on the health of women and on sex and gender influences; Whereas, over the past 25 years, ORWH has established several career-enhancement initiatives for women in biomedicine, including the Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health program that connects junior faculty with mentors who share interests in women's health research; Whereas ORWH co-directs the NIH Working Group on Women in Biomedical Careers, which develops and evaluates policies to promote the recruitment, retention, and sustained advancement of women scientists; Whereas the Women's Health Initiative (in this resolution referred to as `WHI') marked the first long-term study of its kind and resulted in a wealth of information so that women and their physicians can make more informed decisions regarding postmenopausal hormone therapy; Whereas WHI reduced the incidence of breast cancer by 10,000 to 15,000 cases per year, and the overall health care savings far exceeded the WHI investment; Whereas ORWH supported the National Cancer Institute's development of a vaccine that prevents the transmission of Human Papilloma Virus, resulting in a decrease in the number of cases of cervical cancer; Whereas, in 1994, ORWH co-sponsored with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases a landmark study, the results of which showed that giving the drug AZT to HIV-infected women with little or no prior antiretroviral therapy reduced the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV by 2/3 ; Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), perinatal HIV infections in the United States have dropped by more than 90 percent; Whereas ORWH co-funded a large clinical study of the genetic and environmental risk factors for ischemic stroke, which identified a strong relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the probability of ischemic stroke in young women, prompting the targeting of smoking as a preventable and modifiable risk factor for cerebrovascular disease in young women; and Whereas, over the past 25 years, ORWH has contributed support toward major advances in knowledge about the genetic risk for breast cancer, and discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic risk markers has enabled better-informed genetic counseling and treatment for members of families that carry mutant alleles: Now, therefore, be it \u00a0That the Senate \u2013 (1) commends ORWH for its work over the past 25 years to improve and save the lives of women worldwide and expresses that ORWH must remain intact for this and future generations; (2) recognizes that there remain striking sex and gender differences among many diseases and conditions on which ORWH should continue to focus; (3) encourages ORWH to continue to focus on ensuring that the NIH supports biomedical research that considers sex as a biological variable across the research spectrum; and (4) encourages the Director of the NIH\u00a0 to continue to consult and involve the ORWH on all matters related to the influence of sex and gender on health, especially those pertaining to the consideration of sex as a biological variable in research with vertebrate animals and humans."},

In addition to the long-term bill, Senator Collins also voted in favor of the three-month extension of highway program that was recently passed by the House of Representatives. \u201cThe bipartisan DRIVE Act gives the state departments of transportation the certainty they need to continue planning and investing in thousands of highway and infrastructure projects that the entire nation relies on.\u00a0 These investments will create jobs, boost our nation\u2019s economy, and keep us competitive in the global marketplace,\u201d Senator Collins continued. \u201cDespite the strong bipartisan passage of this long-term legislation in the Senate, however, we must also pass another short-term extension rather than immediately enacting a longer-term bill to prevent the Highway Trust Fund from expiring after this week.\u201d The current highway authorization is set to expire tomorrow, when the Highway Trust Fund will be depleted to levels that can no longer fully reimburse states for construction that has already been completed.\u00a0 Since 2009, Congress has passed numerous short-term extensions. \u201cThis is a critical time of year for our country and the State of Maine, where peak construction work occurs during the short summer season.\u00a0 The Commissioner of Maine\u2019s Department of Transportation has told me that if the Highway Trust Fund is not fixed by July 31, 2015, that the Department will have to have to stop construction projects mid-stream within weeks,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u00a0\"This halt in construction would be devastating for our state\u2019s economy, for the people employed in these well-paid construction jobs, and for the transportation infrastructure in desperate need of repair.\u201d Maine currently receives $170 million of Federal Highway funds annually, and the Maine Department of Transportation needs and obligates every single dollar.\u00a0 Under the long-term, bipartisan DRIVE Act, Maine would receive $187 million the first year increasing to more than $215 million.\u00a0 In addition, the legislation also prioritizes bridge reconstruction and safety.\u00a0 With more than 360 of Maine\u2019s bridges rated as structurally deficient, funding this safety provision is urgent.

The amendment was included as part of the final Senate Appropriations Financial Services and General Government (FSGG) annual funding bill that passed out of Committee this afternoon. The bill must now be considered by the full Senate. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe recent cyber attack at OPM was a glaring exposure of the current vulnerabilities to our federal cybersecurity system and a reminder that we are in the midst of a cyber-war. Our adversaries\u2014including state actors, terrorists and hacktivists alike\u2014are increasingly turning to the cyber realm and we must ensure that all of our federal agencies are in compliance with current cybersecurity standards and that their databases and networks are properly protected and secured,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cThis bipartisan amendment sends an important message to the Administration, to the American people, and to the millions of former, current, and retired federal employees that Congress expects strict adherence to cyber security standards on all .gov networks.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of note, the  , that Senator Collins introduced yesterday along with Senators Mark R. Warner (D-VA), Dan Coats (R-IN), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), takes five important steps to strengthen the security of the networks of our federal civilian agencies. This amendment codifies the 5th step the bipartisan bill would require as part of the FSGG Appropriations bill that will likely receive floor time this year, bringing the effort to increase protection for federal civilian networks one step closer to fruition. Senator Collins and Senator Mikulski both serve on the Appropriations Committee. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why an annual report from OMB is necessary: At present, OMB has broad authority to enforce federal cybersecurity standards under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), the law that Congress passed in 2002 to protect .gov networks. Despite this authority, efforts to secure the .gov networks have faltered. Alarmingly, information security instances in the federal government have increased more than twelvefold, from 5,500 in fiscal year 2006 to more than 67,000 in fiscal year 2014\u2014according the Government Accountability Office (GAO). In addition, federal agencies have failed to adopt or implement hundreds of recommendations form the GAO and the Inspectors General that could enhance the security of their networks and 19 of 24 major agencies have declared cybersecurity as a significant deficiency or material weakness. \n"},

We must never forget that the girls of Nigeria were targeted simply because they chose to pursue an education.\u201d According to the Congressional Research Service, in total, Boko Haram may have killed more than 11,000 people, with more than 5,500 people killed in 2014 alone. The legislation adopted today requires the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense to jointly develop and submit to Congress a comprehensive strategy to combat the terrorist group focused on building institutional capacity, humanitarian support, and rule of law programs. The measure also requires the Administration to identify the resources required to implement the strategy. \u201cThis bipartisan legislation would signal a renewed congressional commitment to pursuing Boko Haram and bolster U.S. efforts throughout the region. The already dire situation there will continue to worsen if the current trajectory is not significantly altered,\u201d Senator Collins continued. \u201cWith the recent election of Muhammadu Buhari as Nigeria\u2019s new president and his stated commitment to battling Boko Haram, there is a window of opportunity to change the course of the fight against this intensifying terrorist threat and send a message to women and girls around the world that these appalling acts of violence will not be tolerated.\u201d Last year, in response to Boko Haram\u2019s kidnapping of the 276 school girls in Nigeria, Senator Collins, joined by Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), led all twenty women Senators in urging Secretary Kerry to seek Boko Haram\u2019s addition to the United Nation\u2019s al-Qaeda Sanctions List. Following this letter, the United Nations Security Council voted to subject Boko Haram to a complete asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo. Co-sponsors include fifteen Senators: Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Patty Murray (R-WA), and Marco Rubio (R-FL)."},

The International Trade Administration\u2019s (ITA) preliminary decision verifying this unfair Canadian subsidy is an important step toward protecting Maine workers at the Madison mill and is the right decision. By contrast, we are extremely disappointed that the ITA would apply other tariffs that could hurt Maine workers employed in the forest products industry by J.D. Irving and at the Catalyst-owned mill in Rumford. The ITA has repeatedly refused to determine the actual subsidies, if any, from the Canadian or provincial governments to J.D. Irving and Catalyst Paper, instead using an arbitrary and unfair figure to devise a tariff that could end up hurting Maine workers. Together, both companies employ more than 1,000 Mainers and will be assigned a duty rate that is largely based upon the massive Port Hawkesbury subsidies rather than a careful assessment of the actual subsidies, if any, they may have received.\u201d"},

Recently, it was an honor to welcome Moninda Marube, a relatively new resident of our State, to our nation\u2019s capital during his amazing 3,700-mile run from Auburn, Maine, to Santa Barbara, California, to raise awareness of the evils of human trafficking. Moninda left his homeland in Kenya in 2010 to escape poverty and violence and came to America to find freedom. Instead of freedom and opportunity, Moninda was met with exploitation and poverty. He and other top athletes from Africa had been tricked by an unscrupulous agent who took nearly all of their winnings and who controlled nearly every aspect of their lives. Why run from Auburn to Santa Barbara? It was after winning the Santa Barbara International Half Marathon in 2011 that Moninda met Dan Campbell, a legendary Maine high school track coach who was working at that event, and told him about his desperate situation. Dan helped Moninda come to Auburn early the next year, opened his home to him, and trained with him. That marked the beginning of the Moninda Movement, a 3,700-mile cross-country running tour designed to educate the public and policymakers about the scourge of human trafficking, as well as to demonstrate the importance of fitness and physical activity in combatting the problem of childhood obesity. Moninda set off from Auburn on July 1. Averaging some 25 miles per day, he reached Washington, DC, on July 27, a distance of nearly 600 miles. When he reached the grounds of the United States Capitol, coach Dan Campbell and his wife, Shari, were there to meet him. It was truly inspiring to see many young athletes from Maine, runners Moninda and Dan have coached, sprint onto the Capitol grounds with Moninda. The people of Auburn have welcomed Moninda with open arms and truly have made him part of the community. Auburn Police Chief Phil Crowell deserves the highest praise for his efforts. He has been a strong advocate for Moninda and an effective voice against human trafficking. In addition, the fitness component of the Moninda Movement is having a tremendous impact -- under the leadership of Dan Campbell, Moninda Marube, and Chief Phil Crowell, the Auburn Police Athletic League running program has grown to more than 50 young athletes. Moninda\u2019s stop in Washington represented a detour of hundreds of miles from Maine to California. I am grateful that it was made in order to bring more attention to the urgent issue of human trafficking. In my work on this issue, I have learned that no place \u2013 including Maine \u2013 is immune from the horror of traffickers luring vulnerable victims into sexual or financial exploitation with the promise of a better life. As Moninda told the crowd on the Capitol grounds, \u201cTraffickers have the sweetest tongue you will ever meet. They promise you heaven, show you chocolates, show you everything of the sweet things. But when it comes to delivery, they deliver hell.\u201d Congress must do more to provide law enforcement with the tools it needs to pursue trafficking and to support those preventive programs that help vulnerable girls and boys, as well as women and men, who fall victim to trafficking. This is one reason why I was proud to cosponsor the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which was signed into law in May. Maine is doing its part to end this scourge. The \u201cNot Here\u201d Justice in Action Network brings together law enforcement and service providers to raise awareness about trafficking. Maine\u2019s Sex Trafficking Action Response Team and the Attorney General\u2019s Human Trafficking Workgroup also provide statewide platforms for sharing resources. Those efforts, along with further work underway in Congress, are shining a bright light on some of the darkest stories imaginable. Moninda Marube is more than a world-class athlete. He is a person of remarkable courage and commitment to others. As his inspiring journey now turns westward to California, the people of Maine are with him every step of the way."},

Senator Collins\u2019 statement, as prepared for delivery: MR/MS. PRESIDENT, this afternoon the Senate will be voting on a motion to proceed to a bill that will completely eliminate all federal funding for Planned Parenthood. While I do not support this legislation, I have received assurances from the Majority Leader that, should the motion to proceed succeed, there will be ample opportunity to offer amendments. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to offer an alternative approach, which Senator Kirk and I will offer as a substitute for the bill. Throughout my service in the Senate, I have been a strong proponent of family planning and measures to promote and protect women\u2019s health. The fact of the matter is that the best way to reduce the number of abortions in the United States is to ensure that women have access to the family planning services they need to protect against unintended pregnancies. That is why I have long supported the Title X family planning program. My support for family planning aside, I was sickened when I viewed the recently released videos featuring Planned Parenthood physicians in both their edited and unedited versions. The callousness that the Planned Parenthood employees displayed in discussing the sale of fetal tissue is appalling. The videos also raise valid questions about the ethics and legality of Planned Parenthood\u2019s practices, and, as a result, I believe that a full investigation is warranted to determine if Planned Parenthood broke federal law prohibiting the sale of fetal tissue. Reviews by state medical boards also are warranted since it appears that some Planned Parenthood doctors may have been putting the procurement of fetal organs ahead of the well-being of their patients. We do, however, need to keep in mind the fact that Planned Parenthood provides important family planning, cancer screening, and basic preventive health care services to millions of women across the country. For many women, Planned Parenthood clinics provide the only health care services they receive. The Title X federal family planning funding that goes to Planned Parenthood already cannot be used for abortions, and the federal Medicaid funding it receives can only be used for abortion in cases of rape, incest, or where the life of the mother is at risk. Some contend that other health providers \u2013 such as community health centers \u2013 could fill the gap in family planning and other women\u2019s health services if federal funding were to be cut off to Planned Parenthood. In my state, the four Planned Parenthood clinics see almost 40 percent of the patients seeking Title X family planning services, and treat virtually all of the patients seeking these services in southern Maine. By way of contrast, the twenty community health center sites in Maine that receive Title X funding see just 17 percent of the patients seeking these services. If we were to defund Planned Parenthood, other family planning clinics in Maine \u2013 including community health centers \u2013 would see a 63 percent increase in their patient load. Moreover, these other family planning clinics are predominantly in the central, western, and northern parts of my state \u2013 none are in the area served by Planned Parenthood. And keep in mind two other facts: the Ernst bill calls for immediate defunding of Planned Parenthood, and none of the Planned Parenthood clinics in Maine engages in the reprehensible practice of procuring and selling fetal organs or tissue. How is it fair to force women to change their health care provider when in the case of Maine\u2019s clinics, there is no evidence at all that they have engaged in a practice that is abhorrent to most of us? I just don\u2019t see how we can ensure that all of the patients currently served by Planned Parenthood can be absorbed by alternative health care providers. The bill that has been proposed by my colleagues would require women to give up the health provider of their choice when we don\u2019t yet know all the facts about Planned Parenthood\u2019s actions. I am therefore joining my colleague from Illinois, Senator Kirk, in introducing legislation that would require the Department of Justice to investigate whether or not Planned Parenthood or its affiliates have engaged in any illegal activity pertaining to fetal tissue and submit a report to Congress on its findings within 90 days. Activities involving fetal tissue have no relationship to Planned Parenthood\u2019s primary mission of promoting and protecting women\u2019s health. While Planned Parenthood claims that only a very small number of its affiliates engage in the sale of fetal tissue and organs, let\u2019s determine the facts. These are the organizations that have sparked the outrage, and I believe that these are the organizations that should be the focus of our efforts. Our legislation would therefore defund any affiliate or subsidiary of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America that receives any compensation for engaging in these activities. This more targeted approach accomplishes three important goals: First, it would not cause women served by the Planned Parenthood clinics that do not engage in these reprehensible fetal tissue sales to lose their health care provider for basic services like family planning and cancer screening. Second, the bill would allow Congress to get the facts to determine if those few Planned Parenthood affiliates that do engage in fetal tissue procurement have broken the law and violated medical ethics. And, third, the bill would defund those affiliates, subsidiaries and clinics that do receive compensation for procuring fetal organs and tissue, thus putting an end to this reprehensible trafficking in fetal tissue. MR./MS. PRESIDENT, I believe that this more targeted approach is the best way forward, and I encourage my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this legislation.  \u00a0 "},

This award recognizes excellent organizations whose activities or policies showed measurable benefits in the health of lower income residents. The winners were selected by HUD, and the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA), and presented at the NEHA Annual Educational Conference & Exhibition in Orlando, Florida on July 13. The Breathe Easy Coalition of Maine works to reduce exposure to secondhand smoke through the promotion of strong voluntary policies that lead to reduced tobacco use and tobacco-free living throughout Maine. The coalition includes the following programs: Smoke-Free Housing Coalition of Maine, Maine Tobacco-Free College Network, Maine Tobacco-Free Hospital Network, and the Maine Tobacco-Free Behavioral Health Network. \u201cThe State of Maine has long been a leader in adopting smoke-free policies that benefit the health and wellness of our communities,\u201d said Senators Collins and King. \"We are very pleased that HUD Secretary Castro has recognized the outstanding and successful leadership by the Breathe Easy Coalition in Portland.

Led by the Breathe Easy Coalition, Maine became the first state in the nation to implement a 100 percent smoke-free policy as a threshold requirement for its state Tax Credit Qualified Allocation Plan application. All 20 of Maine\u2019s Public Housing Authorities have adopted a smoke-free housing policy to make their buildings, including individual units and common areas, smoke-free. Maine was the first state in the nation to protect all of its public housing tenants from secondhand smoke. These public policies have also fostered changes in private sector housing; a recent state-wide survey found that 65 percent of Maine landlords report having a smoke-free policy and 62 percent of tenants report living in a 100 percent smoke-free building.

Every day, millions of Americans use, and rely on, our nation\u2019s transportation system that the Federal Government authorizes, funds, and continues to update. That is why we are pleased to see the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, & Transportation move forward on the reauthorization of critically important surface transportation programs under the Department of Transportation. We believe that long-term legislation is the right step to ensure the safety and long-term viability of our surface transportation systems. However, the complete overhaul of the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) competitive grant program is a portion of your legislation that concerns us greatly. Under Title I, Section 1206, your bill would establish a grant program to fund freight infrastructure projects, replacing the TIGER grant program as it exists today. We strongly believe that the TIGER grant program has been a resounding success, and has allowed the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) to explore ways to deliver projects faster, save on construction costs, and make investments in our nation's infrastructure that make communities more sustainable. Additionally, the current TIGER grant program provides flexibility to state and local agencies and public-private partnerships, thereby giving communities the ability to solve complex transportation challenges. The raw numbers suggest just how successful the program has been. Since 2009, Congress has dedicated more than $4.6 billion for seven rounds of TIGER grants to fund regional and local projects that have a significant impact on the country. The program\u2019s highly competitive process, galvanized by tremendous applicant interest, has allowed the USDOT to fund 342 projects in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Demand has been overwhelming, and during the previous seven rounds, the USDOT received 6,732 applications requesting more than $133 billion for transportation projects across the country. Replacement of the TIGER grant program is not necessary; the reauthorization, however, is. As your Committee continues through the process of marking up your legislation, we hope that you will reconsider an overhaul of the program, and instead reauthorize the vehicle that has been essential to rebuilding our infrastructure, stimulating our economy, creating jobs, and providing increased public safety.

The Enhanced Security Clearance Act would implement automated random reviews of public records and databases for any information that might affect the security clearance status of individuals who hold such a clearance. The adopted measure also requires the DNI to develop and implement a plan for eliminating the backlog of overdue periodic investigations. The bipartisan bill requires the federal government to implement an automated review that would search public records and databases for information on every individual with a security clearance at least twice, at random times, every five years. These audits would identify information that these individuals are already obligated by law to disclose, including information relating to any criminal or civil legal proceedings; financial information relating to the covered individual; data maintained on any terrorist or criminal watch list; and any publicly-available information that suggests ill intent, vulnerability to blackmail, compulsive behavior, and allegiance to another country. If, in the course of a randomly timed audit required under the Senators\u2019 bill, the review finds any information pertinent to security clearance, the agency will follow the procedures already established under current law to make an informed determination as to the individual\u2019s ongoing employment, level of clearance, and access to classified information. \u201cThe gaping holes in our current national security clearance process allow individuals who demonstrate obvious high-risk behavior to access to classified information. This bipartisan legislation strikes the important balance between the need to process clearances quickly and efficiently, while also making certain that the process is thorough enough to detect potential problems,\u201d said Senator Collins, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and former Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. \u201cThe Enhanced Security Clearance Act represents a sensible path forward to protect our national security, ensure faith in our federal workforce, and help prevent future tragedies.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re one step closer to our goal of boosting safety for all Americans. Our national security is threatened if folks with access to classified information can\u2019t be trusted. With more rigid oversight and automated, repeated background checks, this bipartisan legislation provides a better, safer system that should also help boost Americans\u2019 confidence in their government.\u201d said Senator McCaskill, the top-ranking Democrat on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. \u201cWe have identified serious gaps in the government\u2019s current security clearance system that could undermine the safety of the federal workforce and our national security,\u201d said Senator Ayotte, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. \u201cOur bipartisan bill includes critical oversight measures to address these shortfalls, including requiring random audits to better identify and address potential security risks, and I\u2019m pleased that the Intelligence Committee recently approved our common sense legislation.\u201d \u201cWe have seen gaps in our nation\u2019s security clearance system, and we need strong reforms to put a precise review process in place both for those already in the system and those seeking clearance,\u201d said Senator Heitkamp, a member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. \u201cOur bipartisan bill would make commonsense changes so the system is secure while also remaining efficient, as we should be able to accomplish both goals.\u201d The Collins-McCaskill-Ayotte-Heitkamp legislation introduced last year has been endorsed by: \u2022Federal Managers Association; \u2022The FBI Agents Association; \u2022The Alcohol-Tobacco-Firearms and Explosives Association; \u2022The International Association of Chiefs of Police \u2022The National Native American Law Enforcement Association; \u2022General Dynamics Information Technologies; \u2022LexisNexis; \u2022Lt.

In May, Senators Collins and King, along with several of their Senate colleagues, urged the agency in a letter to delay the regulations so that these establishments in Maine and around the country, which often sell food for in-store consumption, would receive adequate time and guidance to comply with the new regulations. In a written response to the senators, the FDA has said that it will delay implementation of the rules until December 1, 2016. \u201cWe are encouraged the FDA has listened to our concerns and those of businesses across the country, and will continue to work with Maine stores to provide the guidance they need to adjust to the new regulations,\u201d Senators Collins and King said in a joint statement. \u201cAs the Commissioner of the FDA has acknowledged herself, these new rules are very complicated, which is why grocery stores and supermarkets in Maine deserve to have the time and guidance necessary to help transition to the new rules.\u201d Senators Collins and King joined with four of their Senate colleagues \u2013 Senators Roy Blunt (R-Missouri), Heidi Heitkamp (D- N.D.), Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), and Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) \u2013 on a letter to Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell that asked for a delay in the implementation of the new regulations of at least a year. The FDA falls under the jurisdiction of HHS. The new menu labeling requirements are the result of a provision in the Affordable Care Act that calls for a national, uniform nutrition-disclosure standard for foodservice establishments, primarily intended for restaurants. The FDA first released draft regulations to implement this provision in 2011, however, the agency also unexpectedly incorporated grocery and convenience stores because of the food sold at deli counters, snack bars, salad bars, and other in-store options. The FDA issued its final menu labeling regulations in December of 2014, and businesses originally had until December 2015 to comply with the regulations. Following the FDA\u2019s decision, they will now have until December 2016 to do so.

This number of affected individuals is more than five times the amount that OPM originally stated. In response to these reports, Senator Collins released the following statement: \u201cIt is outrageous that the personal information of at least 21.5 million individuals has been compromised as a result of an extensive cyber-attack at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Despite knowing that its files contained highly sensitive personal data such as Social Security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, and in some cases, extensive background information, OPM officials ignored repeated warnings from its own Inspector General about the vulnerability of its computer systems. \u201cIt is also unacceptable that OPM officials for weeks maintained that only 4.2 million Americans were affected, disputing the FBI\u2019s assertion that the real number was 18 million. Today, we finally learn from OPM that the accurate number is many times the 4.2 million and even higher than that initially estimated by the FBI. In the latest statement, OPM officials implausibly assert that 'There is no information at this time to suggest any misuse or further dissemination of the information that was stolen from OPM\u2019s systems.' That incredible statement, which implies that the perpetrators of this lengthy and extensive attack have no intention of using the stolen data, suggests that OPM has yet to come to grips with the gravity of this cyber-attack.\""},

{"title": "A Worthy Tribute To A Woman Of Firsts", "date": ["Posted Fri, 07/10/2015 - 15:09"], "release": "Maine\u2019s Margaret Chase Smith was the first woman to serve in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. She was the first woman to have her name placed into nomination for President by a major party. During most of her 23-year tenure, she was the only woman in the Senate, and her service broke barriers and opened doors for generations of women to come. What better tribute could our nation pay to this remarkable woman of so many firsts than to make Margaret Chase Smith the first woman to have her portrait featured on our nation\u2019s paper currency? The U.S. Treasury is currently in the process of selecting a woman for this distinction who was a \u201cchampion for our inclusive democracy.\u201d I have written to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew urging him to give full consideration to making Margaret Chase Smith the new face of America\u2019s $20 bill. Margaret Chase Smith was more than a woman of firsts \u2013 she was a leader of integrity and courage. As a freshman Senator in 1950, she boldly spoke out against the excesses of Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin in her famous \u201cDeclaration of Conscience\u201d speech. She forcefully defended the right of all Americans to think for themselves and to hold unpopular beliefs. Her Declaration of Conscience was the beginning of the end for Senator McCarthy\u2019s small-minded reign of terror. Standing up to that bully was extraordinarily brave at the time, but it was typical of Senator Smith\u2019s courageous and independent spirit. Margaret Chase Smith was also instrumental in cementing the crucial role women play as an integral part of our Armed Services. As a lifelong advocate of women\u2019s contributions to our nation\u2019s defense, one of Margaret Chase Smith\u2019s earliest legislative accomplishments was her leading role in the passage of the Women\u2019s Armed Forces Integration Act, which ensured that women serving our nation were treated as part of the regular Army (and received regular Army benefits) as opposed to reserves or volunteers. So many women of my generation were inspired to public service by Margaret Chase Smith, including myself. I had the privilege of meeting her during a visit to Washington when I was a senior at Caribou High School and was participating in the Senate Youth Program in Washington. I expected our meeting to be a quick handshake and a photograph, but we talked for nearly two hours. We discussed many important issues and she answered my many questions, but what I remember most was her telling me always to stand tall for what I believed. Although I couldn't have known it at the time, that meeting was the first step in a journey that led me to the U.S. Senate 25 years later. I am proud to hold the seat once held by a woman who made such a difference, and it is truly an honor to sit in her desk on the Senate floor. At present, the $20 bill features President Andrew Jackson. The grassroots movement to replace his portrait with that of a woman is driven by the discomfort many Americans rightly have of President\u2019s Jackson\u2019s legacy as a slaveowner and with his anti-Native American policies that led to the Trail of Tears. It is worth noting that President Jackson himself was a replacement on the $20 bill \u2013 for President Grover Cleveland in 1928 \u2013 in recognition of the centennial of his inauguration. In addition, it is ironic that President Jackson is featured on any bill, as he was a vehement opponent of government-issued paper money. Despite popular support for a new $20 bill, the Treasury Department says the $10 bill is next in line for replacement in Treasury\u2019s currency cycle. So far, Treasury resists breaking that cycle to put a woman\u2019s portrait on the $20 bill. I have asked Secretary Lew to reconsider that position. Surely Treasury can find a way to adjust its currency cycle to acknowledge this critical role by placing the portrait of a woman on the $20 bill and thus avoid stripping Alexander Hamilton of his appropriate place on the $10 bill. Alexander Hamilton came to the United States as an orphaned immigrant, and his energy and intellect fueled his meteoric rise in step with the growth of the nation. He was a hero of the Revolutionary War, and the author of the majority of the essays that made up The Federalist Papers that argued for the adoption of our Constitution. Most significantly, as our nation\u2019s first Treasury Secretary, Hamilton created an environment that eventually led to America\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s economic powerhouse. Secretary Hamilton\u2019s portrait should remain on the $10 bill. Women have played a critical role in the social, cultural, economic, and political life of our country since its founding and continue to shape American society for the better today. Margaret Chase Smith exemplifies the important role women have played throughout our nation\u2019s history. When she was asked about a woman\u2019s \u201cproper place,\u201d she put it best: \u201cEverywhere!\u201d I would add: \u201cincluding on the $20 bill!\u201d"},

Given Iran\u2019s involvement in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen, Tehran is likely to use this money to fuel sectarian conflicts in the region. \"Finally, after a certain period of time, the agreement would lift the Iranian arms embargo and ballistic missile restrictions, thus allowing countries such as Russia to supply the Iranians with stronger military capabilities. I am very concerned about these provisions and will be seeking answers from the Administration on why it would include provisions that would strengthen Iran\u2019s military and lead to weapons proliferation. \"While I will withhold judgment until more details are provided by the Administration, the answers to these and other serious concerns will determine whether or not I can support the final agreement.\" Click   to view video footage of Senator Collins\u2019 statement"},

{"title": "The Path To A Cure For Type 1 Diabetes", "date": ["Posted Fri, 07/17/2015 - 13:50"], "release": "With its magnificent buildings, monuments, and memorials, Washington is a city of inspiring sights. Just as inspiring was the sea of blue t-shirts worn by the more than 160 young delegates to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation\u2019s 2015 Children\u2019s Congress who participated in a recent Aging Committee hearing I chaired on how diabetes affects people of all ages and their families, and the importance of research to prevent, treat, and eventually cure this difficult and life-long disease. This was the eighth consecutive Children\u2019s Congress that I have chaired. As the founder of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have learned a lot about the difficulties and heartbreak that this disease causes for so many American families as they await a cure. Diabetes is a life-long condition that does not discriminate: it affects people of every age, race, and nationality. Nearly 30 million Americans have diabetes and another 86 million have prediabetes. In addition to the human toll, diabetes costs the United States an estimated $245 billion a year \u2013 a cost that is projected to more than double by the year 2020. It also accounts for one out of three Medicare dollars. In fact, medical costs for Americans with diabetes are more than double those incurred by individuals without diabetes. The statistics are overwhelming. But what really motivates me to devote so much energy to this issue is meeting people \u2013 like the Children\u2019s Congress delegates and their families from every state and around the world \u2013 whose lives have been forever changed by diabetes. The burden of diabetes is particularly heavy for individuals with Type 1 diabetes. Usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, Type 1 diabetes is a disease that one can never outgrow. That is why it is so important that the delegates traveled to Washington to tell their stories and to put a human face on the statistics. It was a great pleasure to get to know the inspiring young people from Maine who came to Washington to participate in the hearing: Isabelle Levesque of Arundel, Mark Hurlbert from Harrington, and Kate Hall from Casco. Isabelle and Kate testified before the Committee, as did a delegate from Missouri. At the other end of the age spectrum, we heard from a celebrated track coach from Rhode Island who has met and overcome the challenge of diabetes for 67 years. Since I founded the Senate Diabetes Caucus in 1997, funding for diabetes research has more than tripled from $319 million to well over a billion dollars this year. As a consequence, we have seen some encouraging breakthroughs and are on the threshold of a number of new discoveries. Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation to extend for two years the Special Diabetes Program that provides an additional $150 million a year for type 1 diabetes research. Two of our witnesses were leading scientists who provided informative and encouraging updates on the latest research. But the true stars of the day were the Children\u2019s Congress delegates. Isabelle, age 10, was the first to testify. Since she was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes eight years ago, she has had to stick a needle into her skin \u2013 to test her blood sugar and to receive insulin \u2013 more than 30,000 times! She said she constantly has to put her life on hold to test her blood, whether at school, at the movies, or in the middle of a soccer or softball game. While Isabelle called upon Washington to increase funding for diabetes research, she is more than doing her part. Her Walk for Diabetes team, Strides for Isabelle, has been the top fundraising team in Maine five of the last seven years and has raised more than $100,000. It was a great pleasure to introduce Kate to the Committee, although she needs no introduction to sports fans throughout Maine. In June, as a graduating senior from Casco, Kate broke a 39-year old national high school record in the long jump, with an astonishing jump of 22 feet, 5 inches. Kate was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was 10. After being benched during her first soccer game after that diagnosis, Kate pledged that she would never allow the disease to stop her from doing what she loved. Although her diabetes requires constant and careful management, and has caused painful muscle cramps during practices and competition, she has kept that pledge. Another hearing witness, Bob Amato was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 67 years ago when he was seven years old, when the disease was considered a bar against an active, athletic life. He challenged this idea and became a successful runner and nationally recognized track coach. During his nearly seven decades of diabetes, he has benefitted from dramatic advancements in managing diabetes. One particular advancement cited by all of our witness is the Continuous Glucose Monitor, a physician-prescribed, FDA-approved medical device that can provide real-time readings and data about trends in glucose levels. Individuals using a CGM have improved overall glucose control and reduced rates of hypoglycemia. While 95 percent of private insurers cover this potentially life-saving device, Medicare does not. Correcting this lack of coverage for America\u2019s seniors is among my highest legislative priorities. A theme of the recent hearing was a shared hope that one day a cure will be found for diabetes, and that Type 1 will become \u201cType none.\u201d With Washington\u2019s support for the brilliant research being conducted and the courage and determination demonstrated by our witnesses, that goal can be reached."},

Warner (D-VA), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), and Dan Coats (R-IN),\u00a0members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, introduced bipartisan legislation that would bolster the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) authority to protect federal civilian networks. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the mandate to protect the .gov domain, it only has limited authorities to do so. At present, DHS does not have the authority to monitor the networks of government agencies unless they have permission from that agency.\u00a0 DHS also cannot regularly deploy countermeasures to block malware without permission from the agency.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 This limited authority hinders the security of .gov information systems which \u2014 as evidenced by the recent OPM attack \u2014 contain highly sensitive personal data such as Social Security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, and in some cases, extensive background information of federal employees, retirees, and contractors.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To fix this problem,  takes five important steps to strengthen the security of the networks of our federal civilian agencies: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 By enacting this legislation, DHS will be in a stronger position to detect and reduce the likelihood of other cyberattacks like the ones we saw at OPM. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe recent cyber attack at OPM affected a staggering number of Americans and exposed a tremendous vulnerability with the status quo in the defense of federal civilian networks. \u00a0Like millions of Americans, I received a letter that my personal data had been compromised,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cThis attack was a stark reminder that our adversaries are increasingly turning to the cyber realm and we must make certain that the Department of Homeland Security is empowered to deploy effective tools in the .gov domain to ensure that government agencies are properly protected. This bipartisan legislation is crucial to securing our government systems and helping to prevent future, potentially devastating cyber attacks against our nation.\u201d  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cBoth the private and public sector need to do a better job of investing in infrastructure and talent to combat an increasing number of cyberattacks,\u201d said Senator Warner. \u201cThe attack on OPM has been a painful illustration of just how behind the curve some of our federal agencies have been when it comes to cybersecurity. Those breaches allowed cyber attackers to get ahold of the personal information of more than 22 million people \u2013 what the FBI Director has described as \u2018a huge deal\u2019 and a \u2018treasure trove of information\u2019 for potential adversaries. If we want to be better prepared to meet this threat in the future, we have to make sure that the Department of Homeland Security has the tools it needs to adequately secure our federal civilian networks.\u201d  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe announcement that OPM\u2019s data breaches compromised the personal data of at least 22 million federal employees, retirees, contractors, and their families is as outrageous and unacceptable as it is devastating,\u201d said Senator Mikulski. \u201cIt\u2019s also a reminder that we are in a new kind of war \u2013 a cyber-war \u2013 against those who would attack and steal from our government and our people. We must act immediately, not only to ensure that the federal government gives the best protection possible to every American whose personal data could be compromised, but also to make sure the Department of Homeland Security has the tools and resources it needs to keep our cyber shields up and working.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIn recent years, cyber intrusions have grown in scope and scale, and the damage is alarming,\u201d said Senator Coats. \u201cThe breach of over 21 million Office of Personnel Management records is the clearest indication yet that the federal government\u2019s cyber defenses are wholly inadequate for today\u2019s threat environment. This legislation would enable the federal government to get its own house in order by fulfilling the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s mandate to protect the government\u2019s networks. Today\u2019s threats are too great to rely on each department and agency to protect their own networks, and recent evidence demonstrates that the status quo is unacceptable. It\u2019s time for DHS to earn its title.\u201d  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe recent security breaches of sensitive government databases pose a serious risk not only to the personal information of those affected, but also to our national security,\u201d said Senator Ayotte.\u00a0 \u201cThere is currently a disconnect in our federal cybersecurity system when it comes to the responsibility, capability, and authority to protect federal agency networks, resulting in serious security vulnerabilities. The reforms in our legislation are major steps in the right direction, allowing the Department of Homeland Security a more direct role and responsibility to guard sensitive data housed in multiple places.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIn the wake of the alarming news that the personal information of millions of Americans has been compromised by a federal agency, we\u2019ve got to employ every tool at our disposal to ensure this data can be protected, and that such a staggering security breach never happens again,\u201d said Senator McCaskill. This bipartisan legislation helps provide those tools by streamlining the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s ability to deploy technology across government to help detect and prevent future cyberattacks.\u201d"},

The planning will include two multi-day meetings for all station directors, scientists associated with field stations, and three scientific advisors. This process will produce a summary of knowledge gaps and research priorities, equipment needs, teaching and training recommendations, and a strategy for data management. Following this initial phase, the directors of the three lead stations will work together to create a 10-year strategic plan for the network that will allow the small stations to coordinate their efforts and fully leverage their capacity. The three lead stations are the Bates College Coastal Center at Shortridge, the Hurricane Island Center for Science and Leadership, and the Bowdoin Scientific Station at Kent Island. There are at least 20 field stations in the Gulf of Maine that gather environmental data, and 10-15 of them are small operations with limited resources. Each of these stations has a limited geographic area that it covers, but together, they span from Nantucket to Nova Scotia. The Gulf of Maine has historically been one of the world's most productive marine ecosystems. However, in August 2014, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a report outlining the decline of the cod population in the gulf.

{"title": "Career Reinventions And The New Retirement Workscape", "date": ["Posted Thu, 07/02/2015 - 15:00"], "release": "In the iconic 1985 film \"Back to the Future,\" Marty and Doc ride a time machine built from a Delorean car thirty years back in time. They end up in 1955 \u2013 the middle of the Baby Boom \u2013 where they save the past, and then blast off again to an impossibly distant future \u2013 the year 2015. As Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, that film came to mind as I chaired a recent hearing on the increasing trend of seniors working past retirement age, and the positive impact this has on their own financial security and on economic growth here in Maine and across the nation. In many ways, the Baby Boom generation is leading us \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d where seniors stay actively engaged in the workforce, contributing their years of wisdom and experience to employers and colleagues, while shoring up their own financial security. For most of the last century, seniors had been withdrawing from the workforce as Americans came to view retirement as a time of uninterrupted leisure that could last for decades. By the year 2000, only 32 percent of Americans age 55 and older were still working, and the average age of retirement had dropped to just 63. But the Baby Boom generation has reversed this trend. Today, 40 percent of workers 55 and older remain in the workforce \u2013 a ratio not seen since the Eisenhower Administration. The Baby Boomers are remaining in the workforce longer for many reasons, but one leading reason is the need for financial security. Previous Committee hearings have explored the issue that many Americans today don\u2019t have the resources they need to live comfortably in retirement without working. It used to be said that retirement security was a three-legged stool \u2013 the first leg being an employer-provided pension, the second being Social Security, and the third being retirement savings. But with the estimated $7.7 trillion gap between what Americans ages 32 to 64 have saved and what they will need for retirement, that third leg has become \u201cwobbly,\u201d and a fourth leg \u2013 continued work \u2013 has been added. Experts tell us that the reengagement of seniors in the workforce could not have come at a better time for our economy. According to human resources professionals, 40 percent of U.S. employers are struggling to fill jobs with qualified workers and could face a crisis if they lose their older workers. But employers don\u2019t need these workers just to fill positions \u2013 they need their talent, their institutional knowledge, and especially their strong work ethic. Workers 55 and older are significantly engaged in their work, a key characteristic of a high-performing workforce. In fact, an engaged workforce is so important to the bottom line that a Fortune 1000 company could improve its profits by $150 million per year if its entire workforce were as engaged as older workers tend to be, according to the AARP. But a business doesn\u2019t have to be among the Fortune 1000 to see these benefits. That point was eloquently made by a Maine entrepreneur I invited to testify at our Committee hearing \u2013 Susan Nordman, the owner of Erda, an artisan handbag company in Dexter. Her skilled and dedicated workforce includes several seniors who need to work and who also want to stay active, physically and mentally. When Susan bought Erda two years ago, she was determined to keep these workers on the job. She moved the business from a dilapidated barn to a more modern building nearby and upgraded antiquated equipment. Since sewing is physically demanding, she initiated ergonomic policies that help all of her employees, regardless of age. Susan\u2019s senior workers bring to her business experience, skill, and equally important, an appreciation for Maine\u2019s manufacturing heritage that too many young people have been denied. She often pairs one younger worker with an older worker so that this knowledge can be passed on. When asked whether older workers are too set in their ways to learn new skills, Susan offered several examples in which it was the seniors who were the quickest to master the new technique and then mentored their young co-workers. Flexibility and adaption are skills developed over a lifetime, or, as Susan put it, \u201cI suspect the old dog that has trouble with a few new tricks was once a young dog that had trouble with new tricks.\u201d Despite the strengths seniors bring to the workplace, some face unspoken \u2013 and misguided \u2013 bias that is difficult to prove, but widely reported. Whatever the reason, it takes twice as long for a senior to find a new job as it does for a younger person, and the job hunt can be especially tough on workers laid off late in their careers. As this generation heads \u201cBack to the Workforce,\u201d employers who want to attract and keep older workers should recognize that many return to work because they want to, not because they have to. These workers are looking for flexible workplaces where they can continue to contribute and where their skills will be valued."},

A call to share the care It takes a nation to support wounded and ill returning veterans By Susan Collins and Nancy Pelosi Monday, July 6, 2015 As America continues to strengthen the care we provide to those who have gone to war on behalf of our nation, we must recognize that for too long we have overlooked the most valuable individuals entrusted with the well-being of our wounded, ill and injured veterans. Nearly five-and-a-half million spouses, parents, children and other loved ones have voluntarily put their lives on hold to provide our returning service members with a trusted continuum of care that could not be replicated without them. Many of them will provide this care for years, if not decades to come. Military and veteran caregivers proudly serve in this role out of an unquestioned commitment to their loved ones. Yet the tremendous demands they face, coupled with a nation long unaware of the responsibilities they shoulder, have resulted in many of these hidden heroes feeling vulnerable, overwhelmed and defeated. Sen. Elizabeth Dole first alerted our nation to the totality of the contributions and challenges of military and veteran caregivers when her foundation announced the results of its 2014 RAND report, providing a nationwide, comprehensive look at this invaluable yet fragile population. RAND's experts estimated that those caring for our service members and veterans provide nearly $14 billion worth of unpaid services each year \u2014 a cost that would otherwise be passed on to our nation. And we cannot even begin to put a price tag on the level of trust our veterans place in these caregivers, particularly those veterans suffering from unseen injuries. Tragically, caring for those suffering from the scars of war takes an enormous toll. America's hidden heroes face increased instances of mental and physical health problems, chronic absenteeism at work, deteriorating personal relationships, legal and financial troubles, and feelings of isolation. The message sent by the foundation's study is clear \u2014 our nation needs to be doing more to support those caring for our wounded, ill and injured warriors. To ensure the U.S. Congress does its part, we have each taken the lead on bipartisan initiatives that will help strengthen the services offered to caregivers, including the launch of the Hidden Heroes Congressional Caucus and the introduction of the Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act. The caucus, established last year with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi's fellow co-chairmen, Sens. John McCain and Jack Reed, and Rep. Jeff Miller, was a call to action for our friends and allies on Capitol Hill to help us continue building awareness and inspiring change both in Washington and across the nation in support of the hidden heroes taking care of those who cared for us. The Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act of 2015, first introduced by Sen. Patty Murray, co-sponsored by Sen. Collins, and sponsored in the House by Rep. Jim Langevin, directly responds to the issues brought to light by the Elizabeth Dole Foundation. Some of the most significant elements of the bill include additional transfer options for the post-September 11 GI Bill, expanded eligibility for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs caregivers program, more comprehensive child care services, and flexible work arrangements for federal employees who are also caregivers. The bill also reauthorizes the Lifespan Respite Care Act, which will provide desperately needed relief to caregivers, particularly those who provide 24-hour care. The progress we can inspire from Capitol Hill stands to make a significant difference in the lives of our military and veteran caregivers, but our nation's support of America's hidden heroes must also emanate from every town and city across America. Just as public, private, nonprofit and faith communities have all rallied around our veterans, all Americans must consider what they can do better support their caregivers. Employers can adapt their work schedules and leave policies, houses of worship can establish family support and respite programs, health care providers can incorporate caregivers into the health care team, lawyers can assist with long-term legal planning, and individual Americans can assist with everyday tasks, just to name a few. The most immediate action we can all take is to learn more about military and veteran caregivers, particularly those who live in our hometowns. In May, the Elizabeth Dole Foundation brought more than 70 caregivers to Washington, D.C. to speak with their members of Congress. The caregivers from our home states told incredibly powerful stories. One of these caregivers said she keeps track of nearly every daily task her husband has to complete, including having to remind him to eat as he can no longer sense the feeling of hunger. Another caregiver has endured the pain of seeing her husband ignore their kids for days at a time and exploding into angry fits that result in broken furniture and holes in the walls. These hidden heroes support veterans who barely survived infamous attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan, and those suffering from the memories that linger from the battlefields of Vietnam. Military and veteran caregivers such as these selfless individuals live in every state across the nation. We should honor our commitment to veterans by answering Mrs. Dole's call to better serve their caregivers. They face obstacles that are overwhelming and vast, yet solvable. By working together, across aisles and sectors, with the involvement of national organizations and grateful individuals, we can rescue our hidden heroes from the shadows and ensure they have the support that they so desperately need and deserve. *Sen. Susan Collins is co-sponsor of the Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act of 2015.

July 7, 2015 The Honorable Jack Lew  Secretary  Department of the Treasury  1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.  Washington, D.C. 20220  Dear Secretary Lew: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I am writing in support of featuring a woman\u2019s portrait on our nation\u2019s paper currency and to applaud your seeking a woman who was a \u201cchampion of our inclusive democracy\u201d for this honor. An ideal choice would be Maine\u2019s legendary former Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who served the American people in the U.S. Senate from 1949 to 1972. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Margaret Chase Smith was the first woman to serve in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and the first woman to have her name placed in nomination for President of the United States by a major political party. She was the only woman in the U.S. Senate during most of her 23-year tenure, and her service broke barriers and opened the door for generations of women to come. There are now 20 women serving in the U.S. Senate and 84 women serving in the U.S. House of Representatives. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Margaret Chase Smith is perhaps best known today for her decision to speak out against the excesses of Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin in her famous \u201cDeclaration of Conscience\u201d speech. She forcefully defended the right of all Americans to think for themselves and to hold unpopular beliefs. Her Declaration of Conscience was the beginning of the end for Senator McCarthy\u2019s small-minded reign of terror. Standing up to that bully was extraordinarily brave at the time, but it was typical of Senator Smith\u2019s courageous and independent spirit. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Margaret Chase Smith was also instrumental in cementing the crucial role women play as an integral part of our Armed Services. As a lifelong advocate of women\u2019s contributions to our nation\u2019s defense, one of Margaret Chase Smith\u2019s earliest legislative accomplishments was her leading role in the passage of the Women\u2019s Armed Forces Integration Act, which ensured that females serving our nation were treated as part of the regular Army (and received regular Army benefits) as opposed to reserves or volunteers. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Margaret Chase Smith has been my role model and inspiration ever since I had the privilege of meeting her during a visit to Washington when I was a senior in high school. Although I couldn't have known it at the time, that meeting was the first step in a journey that led me to the U.S. Senate 25 years later. I am proud to hold the seat once held by a woman who made such a difference. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I understand that the $10 bill is next in line for replacement in Treasury\u2019s currency cycle. You have been quoted in the press saying that you \u201cdon\u2019t think it could be justified to break the cycle\u201d to put a woman\u2019s portrait on the $20 bill. Respectfully, I disagree. Women have played a critical role in the social, cultural, economic, and political life of our country since its founding and continue to shape American society for the better today. Surely Treasury can find a way to adjust its currency cycle to acknowledge this critical role by placing the portrait of a woman on the $20 bill. Doing so would ensure fitting recognition of the important role women have played throughout our nation\u2019s history, without stripping Alexander Hamilton of his appropriate place on the $10 bill.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the architect of American fiscal, banking, and monetary policy, Secretary Hamilton\u2019s portrait should remain on the face of the $10 bill. Alexander Hamilton came to the United States as an orphaned immigrant, and his energy and intellect fueled his meteoric rise in step with the growth of the nation.

{"title": "Strengthening Our Cybersecurity", "date": ["Posted Fri, 07/24/2015 - 14:20"], "release": "The information and communications networks we refer to as cyberspace are critical to our economy, national defense, homeland security, and everyday lives. Yet every week, we learn of more threats to our cyber infrastructure. The specter of our adversaries disrupting our telecommunication system, shutting down our electrical power, or freezing our financial markets is not science fiction. This reality was powerfully demonstrated by the recent cyber attack that compromised the personal information of at least 21.5 million former and current federal employees. The hacking of computer systems at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) affected a staggering number of Americans. OPM was inexcusably negligent in protecting this information, but this cyber theft exposed a tremendous vulnerability in the defense of federal civilian networks. Like millions of Americans, I received a letter that my personal data had been compromised. The information systems of the federal government contain highly sensitive personal data, such as Social Security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, and in some cases, extensive background information of federal employees, retirees, and contractors, who have applied for security clearances. Yet, while the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a mandate to protect the dot-gov domain of federal civilian agencies, it has only limited authorities to do so. At present, DHS experts do not have the authority to monitor the networks of government agencies unless they have permission from that agency. DHS also cannot regularly deploy countermeasures to block malware without permission from the agency. This limited authority hinders the security of dot-gov information systems. The OPM attack was a stark reminder that our adversaries are increasingly turning to the cyber realm. We must make certain that the Department of Homeland Security is empowered to deploy effective tools in the dot-gov domain to ensure that government agencies and the data their systems contain are protected. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and based on my experience as a former leader of the Homeland Security Committee, I have introduced bipartisan legislation that is crucial to securing our government systems and helping to prevent future, potentially devastating, cyber attacks against our nation. This protection is urgently needed. In addition to the OPM, such federal agencies as the IRS, the Patent Office, the Social Security Administration, and Medicare are repositories of vast quantities of sensitive personal data of Americans. And, the threat is increasing. Between 2006 and 2014, information security incidents in the federal government increased more than twelve-fold, from 5,500 incidents to more than 67,000. Our bipartisan Federal Information Security Management Reform Act takes five important steps to strengthen the security of the networks of our federal civilian agencies. First, our bill would allow the Department of Homeland Security to operate intrusion detection and prevention capabilities on all federal civilian agencies without waiting for a request from every federal agency. Today, if an agency is uncooperative with DHS or simply does not want to make cybersecurity a priority, there is little that can be done to strengthen the agency\u2019s vulnerable network. Second, our bill would also allow DHS to conduct risk assessments of any network within the dot-gov domain. This provision will ensure that no federal agency can be unaware if it has not sufficiently secured its network and thus jeopardized sensitive data. Third, our bill would allow DHS to operate defensive countermeasures on these networks once a cyber threat has been detected. Currently, DHS can only deploy technical assistance to assist agencies to diagnose and mitigate cyber threats at an agency\u2019s discretion, and sometimes there are legal impediments to doing so. Fourth, our legislation would strengthen and streamline the authority Congress gave to DHS last year to issue binding directives to federal agencies, especially to respond to substantial cyber security threats or in emergency circumstances. Finally, while DHS administers the protection of federal networks, the Office of Management and Budget has the ultimate responsibility to enforce federal cybersecurity standards. Our bill would require OMB to report to Congress on its enforcement of government-wide cybersecurity standards through the use of its budget process. Congress has already given OMB this significant tool, but the evidence to date suggests that OMB is not wielding this tool enough. The primary problem our bill would solve is that DHS has the mandate to protect the dot-gov civilian domain, but it has only limited authorities to do so. This approach is in sharp contrast to the robust authorities that the National Security Agency has to defend the military\u2019s dot-mil domain, which our legislation does not affect in any way. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson has said that obtaining clear congressional authorization for DHS to deploy protective capabilities to secure civilian agencies is one of his priorities. I heard that same message from his predecessor, Janet Napolitano, when I was the Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee in 2012. That year, we urged our colleagues to pass the Cybersecurity Act that included major reforms to improve the protection of federal networks. We will never know if the OPM breach that compromised the personal information of more than 21 million people could have been prevented if the Senate had passed that bill three years ago. What we do know, however, is that the federal government has enormous amounts of personal information for a wide range of valid and important purposes, such as determining eligibility for federal programs, and that the government has a great obligation to safeguard that information. For years, experts have warned that the question of a crippling cyber attack is not \u201cif,\u201d but \u201cwhen.\u201d As the OPM breach has shown, \u201cwhen\u201d is here, and the time to act is now."},

{"title": "Helping America\u2019s Homeless Youth", "date": ["Posted Fri, 06/12/2015 - 11:50"], "release": "This month, U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro accepted my invitation to travel to Maine to see firsthand how organizations in our state tackle the very important issue of runaway and youth homelessness. I have worked closely with Secretary Castro on a number of issues, and he has been a willing and eager partner in our work together to prevent and end youth homelessness nationwide. The nearly 195,000 homeless children and teens across our nation make up approximately one-third of the entire homeless population in America. More than 45,000 of these children face the danger and despair of homelessness alone, unaccompanied by a parent or guardian. As Chairman of the Senate Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, combatting youth homelessness in Maine and across the United States continues to be one of my top priorities. In April, I chaired a hearing that examined HUD\u2019s efforts to help meet our national goal of ending child, youth, and family homelessness by 2020. Our hearing featured two witnesses who, with the help of effective programs, overcame homelessness as teens to build productive lives and to serve others. The first witness was the award-winning recording artist and youth homelessness activist, Cyndi Lauper.\u00a0 The second was Brittany Dixon of Auburn, an alumni of New Beginnings, an outstanding Lewiston-based organization that provides emergency services and transitional living programs for youth throughout Maine. With help of the resources and dedicated staff at New Beginnings, Brittany has earned a college degree, supports herself as an educational technician, and is pursuing her goal of teaching kindergarten. Secretary Castro and I spend a great deal of time in Washington pouring over budget numbers and looking at statistics. For this reason, it was refreshing and important for us to hear directly from people who are affected by the policy decisions that we make. One such person was Hailey, age 17, who shared her compelling story when Secretary Castro and I visited New Beginnings, the only 24-hour licensed shelter for children and teens in Maine. Hailey was put into foster care at age nine, the first of more than 25 foster home placements in her young life. As a homeless teen, she stayed with friends and family, at shelters, and even in places that were not safe. She faced many obstacles including hunger and a lack of physical and mental health care. With the help of New Beginnings, Hailey persevered and turned her life around.\u00a0 Without New Beginnings, she told Secretary Castro and me, \u201cI would be living on a park bench.\u201d Instead, she just graduated from high school and is entering a program that will help her develop workplace skills and secure her own housing. This statement from Hailey makes clear why the issue of ending youth homelessness is so urgent: \u201cWhat I can\u2019t stress enough is that we are children, minors who have no home or sense of security in really anything.\u201d It was a pleasure to introduce Secretary Castro to New Beginnings Executive Director Bob Rowe and Shelter Director Marian Carney so he could learn how the organization has brought government agencies, businesses, charities, law enforcement, schools, and the entire community together to build a program that is a model for the nation. From its start 35 years ago to the opening of the new Ann Geiger Center this spring, New Beginnings has helped homeless youth gain the sense of safety and security of having a place to call home, and provided them with other resources to succeed, from assistance with college applications to developing such life skills as living on a budget and learning to cook.\u00a0 In order to serve youth like this, New Beginnings has received federal funding as part of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, which allowed it to expand its outreach program. While in Maine, Secretary Castro and I also had the opportunity to meet with 60 representatives from virtually all of the Public Housing Authorities across Maine. These individuals are on the front lines of serving those who might otherwise be homeless or who are just one paycheck away from homelessness. Their input is crucially important to developing and funding federal programs aimed at ensuring safe, decent, affordable housing for some of our most vulnerable citizens. The powerful stories we heard from young people in Maine underscore the ongoing need for these critical programs. Effective organizations like New Beginnings and committed leaders like Secretary Castro send a powerful message to the most vulnerable among us: there are people who care about you, who want you to be safe, and who want you to succeed."},

The bill must now be considered by the full Senate. The Collins-Shaheen amendment was introduced in response to the National Marine Fisheries Service\u2019s (NMFS) recent decision to decrease funding for at-sea monitoring for the 2015 fishing year. The amendment directs NMFS to find a resolution to the disruption caused by this funding decision. In April, Senator Collins authored a bipartisan letter to Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, Eileen Sobeck, which noted: \u201cSuddenly declining stock assessments have led to drastic cuts in fishing quotas and fishermen\u2019s revenues. This unexpected crisis has left many of our fishermen, particularly those with the smallest boats, with little room to pay additional per-trip fees for at-sea monitoring.\u201d The Senators\u2019 bipartisan amendment underscores the Committee\u2019s serious concern with NMFS\u2019s funding decision. The bill also provides funding for several NOAA programs that benefit Maine, including: \u2022 $72.2 million toward annual stock assessments and improved data collection. The information collected through the expansion of annual stock assessments and data collection serves as the basis for formulating sound management decisions and ensuring sustainable fisheries practices. \u2022 $24.5 million toward survey and monitoring. This funding supports important survey work that is essential to maintain the scientific integrity of data collections that feed into fishery stock assessments. \u2022 $12 million toward cooperative research. Cooperative research allows fisheries managers to harness the skills and unique knowledge of local fishermen to collect data critical to sustainable fisheries management."},

It is vital that we provide taxpayers with the tools they need to correctly pay their taxes.\u201d Read the full text of the letter below or click   for a PDF. June 15, 2015 The Honorable John Koskinen Commissioner of Internal Revenue Internal Revenue Service 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20224 Dear Commissioner Koskinen: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We write to express concern about a proposal that we understand is currently being considered by IRS leadership to close the Lewiston, Maine, Taxpayer Assistance Center (TAC).\u00a0 We urge you to reject this proposed closure, which would exacerbate the service problems that taxpayers are already experiencing.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We have heard from a number of constituents who have contacted our offices even before this proposal to express concerns regarding difficulties in accessing IRS services.\u00a0 As has been well documented, taxpayer service nationwide suffered severely in the 2014 tax filing season.\u00a0 In the recently released 2014 Annual Report to Congress, National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson designated inadequate taxpayer service as the most serious problem for our nation\u2019s taxpayers. In addition to the higher percentage of unanswered phone calls and longer wait times for the callers trying to reach the IRS, service at the TACs has also declined. You recently noted in Congressional testimony that you were \u201cdismayed by the reports [you] received of taxpayers lining up outside [the TACs] hours before they opened in order to get service.\u201d\u00a0 We understand the budgetary constraints that your agency faces; however, it is vital that taxpayers are not disproportionally harmed by these cuts. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In addition to reducing the number of TACs and the number of employees working in the TACs, IRS has also decreased the services available at the TACs.\u00a0 In 2013, IRS made the decision to eliminate the return preparation assistance that has traditionally been offered at the TACs. IRS also instituted a policy of declining to answer tax law questions that are beyond basic questions.\u00a0 IRS has attempted to eliminate the provision of transcripts at the TACs, and we have heard that the IRS plans to make all TACs open by appointment only. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Given the complexity of our tax system, providing adequate assistance to taxpayers is a necessity for accurate tax collection. TACs provide taxpayers with vital face-to-face assistance, including help with questions in all areas of tax compliance and distribution of tax forms. The reduction of in-person assistance disproportionately affects seniors and those in rural areas.\u00a0 This is particularly relevant for Maine, as Maine has the oldest population in the country and is the most rural state in the nation. TACs are also of particular importance for taxpayers who do not have Internet access, and for low-income and disabled taxpayers, as well as for taxpayers who have limited proficiency in English. According to TIGTA, service cuts at the TACs were made \u201cwithout evaluating the burden that the changes would have on the low-income, elderly, and limited-English-proficient taxpayers who seek face-to-face service.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There are currently five TACs in Maine, located in Augusta, Bangor, Lewiston, Presque Isle, and South Portland.\u00a0 We understand that many Mainers already drive two and three hours to obtain assistance. Making matters worse, due to Maine\u2019s harsh winters, transportation in this area can be particularly difficult between January and April, which is when most taxpayers are in need of service. Simply directing taxpayers to other TAC locations in Maine is not an acceptable solution as the Lewiston-Auburn area is the second largest populated area in the state and serves as a hub for many taxpayers in western Maine.\u00a0 In addition, shifting residents to other TACs could overwhelm those locations and negatively affect their provision of services.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 While cost-cutting measures may be necessary, reducing access to TACs could be counterproductive.\u00a0 Without access to help, non-compliance will inevitably increase, which could lead to a decrease in the revenue that our government collects.\u00a0 As noted in the National Taxpayer Advocate\u2019s 2014 Report to Congress, \u201cit is in the government\u2019s self-interest to facilitate voluntary compliance because voluntary compliance is far more cost effective than enforced compliance.\u201d It is vital that we provide taxpayers with the tools they need to correctly pay their taxes.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Closing the Lewiston TAC would be harmful to Maine taxpayers. We ask that you explore other options to keep all five Maine TACs open."},

{"title": "Ringing Off The Hook: The Proliferation Of Unwanted Calls", "date": ["Posted Fri, 06/19/2015 - 15:03"], "release": "When Congress passed legislation creating the National Do Not Call Registry in 2003, we thought we had put an end to the plague of unwelcome telemarketers who were interrupting Americans morning, noon, and night. But now, nearly twelve years later, phones are once again ringing off the hook. Too many of us can relate to the frustration that results from high volumes of unwanted and disruptive calls. Yet, signing up for the Do Not Call list doesn\u2019t seem to make a difference in far too many cases. In addition, advances in technology, such as robocalls, the ability to disguise, or \u201cspoof\u201d a caller ID, and Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP), are making it easier for scammers to reach potential victims. I recently chaired a Senate Aging Committee hearing to examine the proliferation of unwanted calls and whether the Do Not Call Registry is still effective. One of our witnesses was Linda Blase, a small business owner from Dallas, Texas, who had become so frustrated and overwhelmed by \u201cjunk\u201d calls that she kept a log of them. Over the course of just one month, she said she received 74 unwanted calls, 62 of which were robocalls. From telephone calls from scammers claiming to be from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and robocalls soliciting home security systems and home mortgages, to a call from someone trying to sell her an ATM machine for her home-based business, the calls keep coming. Ms. Blase has been trying for years to stop these calls through complaints to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), complaints to the Consumers Union, and by registering for the Do Not Call list. Yet, her unwanted calls have not only continued, they have increased. Unfortunately, this is a very common complaint reported to the Aging Committee\u2019s Fraud Hotline (1-855-303-9470). In addition, according to the FTC, complaints related to unwanted calls are the largest category of complaints received by the Commission, numbering more than 215,000 last year. A large part of the problem traces to the fact that the regulatory framework behind the Do Not Call list has been rendered ineffective by advances in technology. It used to be that phone calls were routed through equipment that was costly and complicated to operate. High-volume calling was difficult and expensive, especially for international calls. That old equipment could not easily be used to disguise or \u201cspoof\u201d a caller ID. But now, phone calls can be routed from anywhere in the world at practically no cost. This can be done using so-called \u201cVoice Over-Internet Protocol\u201d technology \u2013 or \u201cVoIP.\u201d And the computer programs needed to generate these calls are remarkably inexpensive and easy to use. Reputable telemarketers scrub their calling lists against a database to make sure they don\u2019t dial numbers belonging to consumers who have signed-up for the Do Not Call list. If you are on that list, there is a good chance that the telemarketer calling you isn't legitimate. Instead, it could be a scam artist using a computer programmed to generate \u201crobocalls.\u201d These robocalls typically originate offshore, often from call centers in India. But you would not know that fact looking at your caller ID because the scammers \u201cspoof\u201d their caller ID to add credibility and hide their true location. Spoofing is a tool used regularly by telephone con artists and is, unfortunately, very easy. To demonstrate how easy, during the recent hearing on this issue, I received a call from what appeared on my Caller ID to be the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Yet, the call was really coming from a member of my staff, who was sitting just a few feet away, and with great ease, was able to spoof the DOJ number from his cell phone number using a free IPhone app. While technology exists to easily generate these calls, fortunately it also exists to block them. Telecommunications companies should be doing more to protect their customers by blocking unwanted calls, but have argued that they do not have the legal ability to do so. In what is a positive development for consumers frustrated by unwanted calls, the FCC has approved a proposal, which I supported, clarifying that telecommunications companies do, in fact, have the ability to block these calls without being in violation of the law. In addition, I have joined with the Aging Committee\u2019s Ranking Member, Claire McCaskill, in introducing a bill that would provide more authority to the FCC to combat Caller ID spoofing and to strengthen penalties for those who generate these calls. Ironically, as I was writing this column, I received two back-to-back, unwelcome telemarking calls at home trying to sell me an extended warranty for my car, despite my having signed up for the Do Not Call Registry! When I answered the calls, there was that telltale sign of a robocall\u2014a pause before a person came on the phone trying to pressure me to buy something I did not want or need. If we are going to win the fight against scammers targeting Americans, it is crucial that we get ahead of the technology they use to generate robocalls and to spoof caller IDs."},

{"title": "Building A Strong Workforce", "date": ["Posted Fri, 05/29/2015 - 15:29"], "release": "If you could get a return of $27 for every one dollar that you invested in a company, you would jump at the chance. According to United States Department of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, that is exactly the return we get for every federal dollar that is spent on apprenticeship training programs. As the Secretary points out, apprenticeships are a tried and true approach for passing the practical training needed to succeed in a job on to the next generation. An apprenticeship is just as applicable to the complex skills needed to compete in the 21st century workforce as it was in the 18th century when this country was founded. I invited Secretary Perez to come to Maine last week so he could see apprenticeship programs in action at Bath Iron Works and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. These two important Maine employers have instituted apprenticeship programs to attract and train highly skilled workers that will help keep their operations competitive for years to come. It is fitting that these two facilities, so important to our nation\u2019s security and our state\u2019s economic future, are on the cutting-edge of workforce development. Secretary Perez has devoted his career to supporting, protecting, and developing a strong American workforce. His obvious enthusiasm for improving opportunities for our workers is infectious, and he has a very clear vision about how job training can lead to a stable and secure middle-class lifestyle. Secretary Perez and I began the day at BIW, a 131-year-old company that depends on highly skilled workers to produce the most advanced surface combatant ships in the world. As the current workforce ages, the shipyard will have to hire many new workers in the years ahead. The leaders from the company and the trade unions recognized the need to provide additional training in order pass specialized shipbuilding skills on to the next generation of workers. They have collaborated on a training program that will help do just that. This relatively new program, which includes an emerging partnership with Southern Maine Community College, has tremendous potential and could be vital to the future success of the shipyard. We then concluded the day at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. Over 200 years old, PNSY is one of only four public shipyards in the United States. Known as the \u201cCradle of American Shipbuilding,\u201d the skilled workers at PNSY today overhaul and maintain the nuclear submarine fleet of the United States Navy. PNSY has gone from \u201csail to the atom\u201d by supporting a rigorous and robust apprentice program, where on-the-job learning, technical trade training, and academics combine to produce the highly skilled workers required by this demanding field. PNSY works closely with York County Community College to offer credits towards associate degrees in trade and technical occupations. During our tour of the shipyard\u2019s learning centers, Secretary Perez and I had the opportunity to meet PNSY apprentice Jennifer Ouellette, who exemplifies the opportunity effective workforce training programs can provide. A native of South Berwick, Jennifer attended college for three years before deciding to pursue a hands-on trade and to turn her passion for welding into a career. This inspired her decision to enter the shipyard\u2019s Trades Apprenticeship program in 2012, and she will graduate as a Journeyman Mechanic with a certificate from the Department of Labor in February 2016. Jennifer currently works on the nuclear-powered attack submarine USS Scranton as a structural welder and is looking forward to a career at PNSY. PNSY has a model apprenticeship program which fulfills critical Navy requirements to overhaul, repair, and modernize Los Angeles and Virginia-class submarines. It is one of the largest employers in the seacoast, employing approximately 4,800 civilian employees, and apprentices currently make up about one-third of the production workforce. I was especially pleased to see how well this program was performing because I worked to include provisions in appropriations bills directing the Navy to induct at least 100 apprentices at each naval shipyard. When we make these important investments in the American workforce, our communities, our State, and our country benefit from the strong return and positive growth they yield. Touring these two facilities reinforced both Secretary Perez\u2019s and my commitment to workforce training. Last year, I supported the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, which passed by an overwhelming, bipartisan vote in Congress and was signed into law by the President. This legislation was a good step towards bringing much-needed improvements to federal job-training programs that American workers can use to develop the skills and knowledge to compete in the 21st Century global economy. These were the first major reforms to federal job-training programs in 15 years. Despite recent improvements in our nation\u2019s unemployment rate, job openings in high-growth industries remain unfilled. In fact, recent data shows that about one-third of the increase in unemployment among college-educated workers in the United States from 2006 through 2010 was the result of workers not having the right skills for available positions. The reforms we passed last year strengthen federal job-training programs that work while eliminating others that were ineffective or duplicative. They establish new public-private partnerships with a focus on employment outcomes, employer satisfaction, and increased accountability for taxpayer dollars. Workforce development will continue to be a priority for me. It is a critical component to preserving many of the good jobs that we have in Maine and it will be one of the keys to attracting more good jobs in the future."},

Rep. Tom Reed (R-New York) and Rep. Blumenauer (D-Oregon) have introduced a companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives.\u00a0 At present, U.S. utilities and factories send enough wasted energy in the form of heat up their chimneys to power all of Japan each year. Maine ranks 10th in the nation in energy expenditures and 26th in energy consumption. Industrial energy efficiency technologies, including combined heat and power (CHP) and waste heat to power (WHP), have proven successful in using this previously squandered energy to warm or cool buildings and generate additional electricity. Utilizing this formerly wasted energy has the potential to increase electrical generation efficiency by nearly 80 percent and reduce costs for industrial users. These savings could be used by U.S. companies to invest in other areas, improving their competitiveness, enhancing energy security and storm resilience, improving water conservation, and creating skilled jobs. According to studies by the Department of Energy and the Oak Ridge National Labs, significantly increasing industrial energy efficiency can help reinvigorate our manufacturing base by creating as many as one million highly skilled jobs.\u00a0 Despite their potential, however, the upfront costs of CHP and WHP systems can be expensive, and facilities seeking to lower their energy bills often lack access to the capital needed for purchasing the equipment.\u00a0 The limits on the size and scope of the current U.S. tax code provision hamper companies from making important investments to increase their efficiency.\u00a0\u00a0 At present, Maine has 32 combined heat and power sites across the state. In order to make the current incentives more accessible and spur greater investment in energy efficient technology across our country, The POWER Act would place CHP and WHP on par with other forms of renewable energy by expanding tax incentives for these systems and reducing the initial cost of deploying these projects.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCapturing and processing this otherwise wasted energy holds tremendous untapped potential for businesses across Maine,\u201d Senator Collins stated. \u201cThis bipartisan legislation helps make energy efficiency technologies more accessible for Maine companies, reducing energy consumption in our industrial sector, saving manufacturers money, and creating energy businesses and jobs.\u201d There are currently  , including the Maine Renewable Energy Association, the Maine Ocean & Wind Industry Initiative, Woodard & Curran, and Self-Gen Inc. \u201cThanks to Senator Collins for championing the POWER Act, which will allow more companies to reduce energy use and costs by installing combined heat and power (CHP) systems.

There may also be situations where more complicated matters can be dealt with in this manner.\u00a0 I certainly do not object to SSA providing services this way where it is appropriate.\u00a0 My concern has been that the SSA has not sought public input with regard to decisions about field offices, nor has it taken into account the impact on the beneficiaries they are supposed to be serving.\u00a0 Even though computer and broadband technologies have become widespread, the idea that the SSA can serve beneficiaries primarily online ignores the very real needs of many in the senior and disabled populations.\u00a0 The fact is, millions of seniors and disabled Americans are not accustomed to doing business online, and particularly in rural areas, many do not have access to computers and high-speed Internet.\u00a0 If a beneficiary has a complex issue to resolve, solving the matter may take the attention of a trained field officer through a face-to-face interaction with the beneficiary.\u00a0\u00a0 During a hearing last year of the Senate Aging Committee, a Medicare Specialist for the Aroostook Area Agency on Aging, located in Presque Isle, testified that the office handled the cases of an estimated 1,400 seniors, and that the loss of face-to-face services would be a real hardship for these individuals.\u00a0 The Aging Committee also completed an investigation and released recommendations related to SSA\u2019s efforts to reduce face-to-face services.\u00a0 A key recommendation was that the agency should take into account the input of members of the local community, as well as the effect a field office closure or consolidation would have on those who rely on these offices.\u00a0 As a result of the Aging Committee\u2019s work, the Social Security Administration\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (SSA OIG), which is SSA\u2019s chief watchdog organization, recently released a report on the process used by the agency to determine whether field offices should be closed, consolidated, or operate under reduced hours.\u00a0 In this report, the SSA OIG wrote, \u201cBecause of the Senate Special Committee on Aging\u2019s investigation, SSA plans to further update its process to evaluate field offices for consolidation.\u201d\u00a0 The report further recommends that SSA strengthen its transparency in the process and consider in the decision-making process the input of the public and other stakeholders, including SSA managers, employees, and elected officials.\u00a0 The report also noted that because the SSA field offices provide the public with a variety of services, SSA must also improve its justification to support consolidating field offices. According to this report, the SSA agreed with this recommendation.  Fortunately, the SSA has not shuttered any field offices this year and, according to the agency, does not plan to do so. It is critical, however, that the agency make a greater effort to take into account the needs of the millions of beneficiaries it serves.\u00a0"},

{"title": "King, Collins Call On FCC To Modernize Support For Rural Broadband Services", "date": ["Posted Tue, 05/12/2015 - 15:09"], "release": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 U.S. Senators Angus King and Susan Collins, along with fifty-nine of their colleagues, yesterday sent a letter to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Tom Wheeler calling for a modernization of rules intended to ensure that Americans in rural areas have access to affordable broadband services. Under current rules, Universal Service Fund (USF) support for broadband in rural areas is dependent on the outdated requirement that customers also sign up for traditional landline phone service.\u00a0 When rural customers \u201ccut the cord\u201d of traditional phone service in favor of wireless or Internet-based phone services, rural communities served by smaller telecommunication providers lose access to USF support for broadband deployment even if the customer continues to pay for broadband Internet service. The outdated rules create a needless link between customers signing up for services they may not want or need and efforts to accelerate broadband deployment. \u201cSmall rural carriers have worked hard to provide innovative services to some of the most difficult-to-serve parts of our country.\u00a0 However, without the update to the USF support rules described in this letter and in the letter last year, many rural consumers will continue to be denied a choice among these innovative services.\u00a0 As the FCC continues to modernize USF to support broadband deployment, we must ensure rural consumers are not left behind by antiquated rules that inhibit investment, adoption, and consumer choice,\u201d Senators King and Collins wrote along with their colleagues. \u201cWe therefore renew our call for the FCC to expeditiously make careful, targeted updates to the existing USF mechanisms to provide sufficient and predictable support so that consumers in areas served by smaller rural carriers can make the choice to obtain robust broadband services at affordable rates without being compelled to purchase other services.\u201d The complete text of the letter is below and can be read  : Dear Chairman Wheeler: On May 6, 2014, 44 Senators signed a bipartisan letter calling on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to move forward on tailored modifications to modernize the federal Universal Service Fund (USF) as it supports the delivery of communications services to consumers in high-cost portions of the United States served by small, rural rate-of-return-regulated local exchange carriers.\u00a0 While we commend the FCC for its continuing efforts to implement a Connect America Fund for consumers in areas served by larger carriers, we are troubled that the FCC has yet to take meaningful steps to address one of the most problematic aspects of the existing USF rules in areas served by smaller carriers. As you know, Americans are increasingly \u201ccutting the cord\u201d and dropping their traditional landline voice \u201cplain old telephone service\u201d (POTS) in favor of wireless or voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service.\u00a0 Many of these consumers, however, still desire fixed broadband services that offer robust speeds \u2013 in fact, fixed broadband services are necessary for consumers to make effective use of VoIP service. Unfortunately, the FCC\u2019s USF rules have not kept pace with changing technology and shifting consumer preference.\u00a0 Instead, out-of-date rules tie high-cost USF cost recovery for small rural carriers to a consumer\u2019s actual purchase of voice service, even if the consumer no longer wants that service and only wants broadband service.\u00a0 The POTS requirement prevents rural consumers from making choices that are available to their urban counterparts.\u00a0 Ironically, these outdated rules may hurt lower-income rural consumers the most, possibly putting the price of broadband out of reach unless those consumers make the additional expenditures to buy POTS as well.\u00a0 A year after the previous letter, the time has come to take common-sense steps to update the rules.\u00a0 While long-term options to modify USF support can and should be explored, as you\u2019ve committed to doing via the Connect America Fund Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the FCC must not leave consumers in the lurch given the substantial time needed to develop, evaluate, and implement such options.\u00a0 No new models or sweeping changes are needed to adopt and implement a targeted update to fix the issue highlighted in this and last year\u2019s letters \u2013 instead a simple plan that isolates and solves this specific issue is all that is needed right now.\u00a0 In addition, we continue to support measures that ensure USF distributions are invested prudently and reasonably, which helps provide the credibility necessary for the FCC to fulfill its statutory mandate. Small rural carriers have worked hard to provide innovative services to some of the most difficult-to-serve parts of our country.\u00a0 However, without the update to the USF support rules described in this letter and in the letter last year, many rural consumers will continue to be denied a choice among these innovative services.\u00a0 As the FCC continues to modernize USF to support broadband deployment, we must ensure rural consumers are not left behind by antiquated rules that inhibit investment, adoption, and consumer choice.\u00a0 We therefore renew our call for the FCC to expeditiously make careful, targeted updates to the existing USF mechanisms to provide sufficient and predictable support so that consumers in areas served by smaller rural carriers can make the choice to obtain robust broadband services at affordable rates without being compelled to purchase other services. Thank you for your consideration.\u00a0 We look forward to continuing to work with you to update USF to ensure rural consumers receive reasonably comparable voice and broadband communications services of their choosing at reasonably comparable rates."},

Meghan, a 16-year-old junior at Falmouth High School, provides people in need in her community with fresh, organic produce through her community garden. After volunteering at the Falmouth Food Pantry and seeing how little fresh produce was available, Meghan was inspired to start her garden as a sustainable, effective way to provide healthier foods for the people using the food pantry. Her garden yields about 500 pounds of food per year. Working with the food pantry coordinators, Meghan researched which crops have high yields and found community members willing to donate space for a garden. Meghan then secured a grant to buy gardening equipment; and spoke at schools, Girl Scout meetings and civic clubs to recruit volunteers. She and her team went to work planting, watering, weeding, harvesting produce and making weekly deliveries to the food pantry. Meghan later enlisted the help of a master gardener who taught her more about growing healthy food. She moved her operation to a larger garden, and began using social media to recruit more volunteers. She also began raising money to maintain the garden by setting up fundraising tables at garden centers. Today, Meghan\u2019s garden is the primary source of fresh produce for the food pantry, which serves about 900 people in her community. Meghan said that organizing and working in the garden helped her \u201crealize the power, strength and grace that come with helping others.\u201d Kevin, 14, an eighth-grader at Madawaska Middle/High School, volunteers to perform a wide variety of jobs during both winter and summer for the Four Seasons Trail Association in his town. Kevin\u2019s service started a few years ago when he saw an older man struggling to carry firewood from the basement to the fireplace at the Association\u2019s lodge and pitched in to help. Kevin then began volunteering to stack and load firewood at the lodge in the winter, keep the pellet stove\u2019s hopper full, shovel the porch and deck, clean and organize the ski closet, and wax skis for the Association\u2019s youth ski program. Kevin found he enjoyed volunteering so much that he wanted to continue over the summer. He now mows the lawn at the lodge and helps to maintain ski trails by mowing and cutting brush. He also has helped build new trails and a garage for the Association. Kevin said the work he does \u201cmakes it easier for people to enjoy the outdoors and do things they like to do. I often tell other young people like me that volunteering can make a big difference to the community.\u201d The energy and commitment demonstrated by Meghan and Kevin benefit their communities today and will for years to come. In addition, both students are learning the important lesson of self-reliance and the sense of accomplishment that come from taking on responsibilities, setting goals, and achieving them. Their desire to serve others is admirable. These two young people exemplify the tremendous capabilities of our youth. Communities across Maine and all of America are brimming with young people making a positive difference. I see it everywhere, and it continues to reaffirm my faith in our next generation of leaders and in our country\u2019s future."},

Following her address, Senator Collins was presented with a Doctorate in Humane Letters during the commencement for her accomplishments and her efforts on behalf of the people of Maine. This ceremony marks UMA's fiftieth anniversary and 5,000 plus attendees attended the ceremony.\u00a0 See below for a full copy of Senator Collins\u2019 remarks, as prepared for delivery Sen. Susan M. Collins UMA Commencement May 9, 2015 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Thank you, President Cummings.\u00a0 Trustees, faculty and alumni, families, and friends, it is a pleasure to be with you today. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Members of the Class of 2015, congratulations!\u00a0 You did it!\u00a0 Thank you for inviting me to be part of this very special moment in your lives. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And to the University of Maine at Augusta \u2013 happy 50th birthday!\u00a0 From a modest start in 1965, UMA has grown to become the third-largest institution in the UMaine System.\u00a0 With campuses here in Augusta and in Bangor, and with University College centers and Community Learning Sites throughout our State, UMA truly lives up to its motto: \u201cStay Close, Go Far.\u201d\u00a0 This school has become Maine\u2019s leading university for supporting students of every age and is nationally renowned for its outreach to our military personnel and veterans.\u00a0 Its remarkable 50 years have enriched our State. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Over the years, I have learned two things about giving commencement speeches.\u00a0 The first is to be brief.\u00a0 I am well aware that this ceremony is the last thing that stands between you graduates and a celebration with family and friends.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I have an added incentive for brevity today, for following my remarks I will be presented with an honorary degree. \u00a0\u00a0I am deeply grateful for this recognition and for the service and commitment of the others being recognized today. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The second thing I have learned is to try to leave you graduates with a message that I hope will be part of your graduation day memories and possibly even somewhat helpful in your journey through life.\u00a0 But I approach this goal mindful of the fact that I remember nothing about the speaker for my own college graduation \u2013- not even his name, much less what he said.\u00a0\u00a0 So here goes. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 America has a maritime tradition of branding each ship with its own motto.\u00a0 One ship in our nation\u2019s fleet bears this distinctive motto: \u201cFind the Good and Praise It.\u201d\u00a0 That ship is named the \u201cAlex Haley,\u201d after an acclaimed African-American author.\u00a0 Mr. Haley wrote the famous novel and television miniseries Roots, which told the story of his ancestors who were kidnapped from the Gambia in Africa and brought to this country as slaves. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cFind the Good and Praise It\u201d was Alex Haley\u2019s personal motto, and it is a message that seems particularly relevant to our times. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We live in an era where the way that we communicate is changing at a pace that was unimaginable even a decade ago.\u00a0 Unfortunately, there has also been a rapid decline in the quality of some of our communications as well. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Let me give you an example.\u00a0 In our political discourse today, some people seem to have forgotten Mr. Haley\u2019s powerful message.\u00a0 People in our State and throughout the country have made it clear that they are fed up with the incivility and gridlock that have prevented congressional action on far too many of the serious problems facing our nation. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But that divisiveness and animosity raise a larger question:\u00a0 Is the gridlock that paralyzes Washington a symptom or the cause of the incivility that we see throughout our society?\u00a0 The \u201csymptom or cause\u201d question may seem to be a variation on the famous \u201cthe chicken or the egg\u201d dilemma.\u00a0 When it comes to the role of civility in all aspects of life, we do well to remember that we get a chicken by hatching the egg, not by smashing it.\u00a0 Too often today, people choose not to pursue the positive but make the choice to attack, to belittle, and to accuse. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And we see this divisive, ugly trend throughout society, from bullying in schools to the anonymous, crude insults that fill the vast expanses of the Internet.\u00a0 The Internet has the potential to bring people together by making new information and different points of view available to all.\u00a0 Ironically, it all too often has the opposite effect.\u00a0 Studies have found that the Internet is displacing face-to-face contact and that Websites devoted to political and social issues increasingly are tending to the extremes, where alternate views are either ignored or misrepresented and ridiculed.\u00a0 Rather than finding the good and praising it, online commentary more often is devoted to negativity and insult. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Last month, after I gave a speech on civility at Colby College, I read the online comments to a newspaper story on that event.\u00a0 One called me a \u201ctraitor,\u201d and another a \u201chypocrite.\u201d\u00a0 Those were some of the nicer comments.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ultimately, whether the decline of civility in Washington has led to the decline of civility in the rest of the country, or vice versa, is irrelevant.\u00a0 We each have a responsibility to turn back this destructive tide.\u00a0 We each have a stake in a society that can work together to solve problems.\u00a0 We each must do our part to elevate the tone and respect one another as part of our greater community. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t recognize evil in the world or speak out against injustice and wrong-doing.\u00a0 But we must not lose sight of what is good.\u00a0 To Alex Haley, \u201cthe good\u201d wasn\u2019t simply what is pleasant.\u00a0 It is what is worthwhile, what makes us better people, better citizens, a better nation.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 So my challenge to you graduates, adapted from Alex Haley, is to \u201cFind the good, praise it, and join it.\u201d\u00a0 I know that some 70 percent of the members of this class are \u201cnon-traditional\u201d students who pursued college after joining the workforce or the military.\u00a0 Whether that describes you or whether you came here directly from high school, your UMA education has prepared you to be part of that great Maine ethic of people working together to build up, rather than tear down.\u00a0 You can make a difference in your communities by elevating the level of discourse and helping to create a climate where people with opposing ideas are treated with mutual respect and civility. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Graduates, the diplomas you receive today represent a great deal of hard work on your part, but they also represent a great debt you owe to those who made it possible.\u00a0\u00a0 To quote another of Alex Haley\u2019s favorite sayings, \u201cAnytime you see a turtle up on top of a fence post, you know he had some help.\u201d\u00a0 Many of you undoubtedly feel a bit like that turtle today.\u00a0 You wouldn\u2019t be here without that help.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget to thank those who helped you achieve this accomplishment.\u00a0 And I urge you to apply your talent, energy, and enthusiasm right here in our great State.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Whether you grew up in Maine, or came here from another state or country, whether it is at the beginning of your career or later on, Maine needs what you have to offer.\u00a0 We need the entrepreneurs and computer technology experts who will create the businesses and jobs of the future.\u00a0 We need the nurses, teachers, and musicians who improve our quality of life.\u00a0 So please:\u00a0 stay in Maine. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There is so much good at this University, in our State, and in our country.\u00a0 Find it, praise it, and join it.\u00a0 Class of 2015, let that be the choice you make, let that be the way you lead your life.\u00a0 Congratulations and good luck."},
{"title": "Senators Collins, King Push To Expand HUBZones, Protect Communities Affected Through BRAC", "date": ["Posted Tue, 05/12/2015 - 09:48"], "release": "Washington, DC \u2013 U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King introduced bipartisan legislation today, the HUBZone Expansion Act, which would better tailor the HUBZone program to meet the needs of communities affected by the closure of U.S. military installations through the Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) process. \u201cMilitary bases serve as critical economic engines for the towns and cities in which they are located,\u201d said Senators Collins and King in a joint statement. \u201cWhen an installation closes as a result of the BRAC process, communities often struggle for years during the redevelopment process.\u201d In order to address these challenges, Congress passed legislation that allows small businesses located on former military bases or in \u201ceconomically distressed communities\u201d with high rates of poverty or unemployment, to obtain certain federal contracting preferences, classifying them as HUBZones. At present, there are 107 BRAC-related HUBZones in the United States. For many of the communities surrounding closed military bases, however, achieving HUBZone status has proven difficult. The law currently requires 35 percent of employees in a qualifying business to live within the geographic boundaries of the closed base. With very few people residing on these closed bases, this requirement makes it difficult for former bases to meet the program\u2019s residency requirement. In addition, businesses are only given HUBZone status for five years. The process of closing a base can take years and many businesses often lose years of program eligibility. To remedy these problems, the HUBZone Expansion Act would make two important modifications. First, it would allow prospective employees who live just outside the boundaries of the closed base to count toward the 35 percent requirement. This larger pool would allow more businesses to qualify for HUBZone status. Second, the legislation would extend the period of time for which a closed base would qualify from five years to eight years. \u201cThe current requirements that need to be met in order to qualify as a BRAC-related HUBZone are exceedingly difficult for businesses and job seekers to meet. This legislation tailors the HUBZone program so it can best help communities and the people most affected get back on their feet after a base closure,\u201d continued Senators Collins and King. As the Senate soon begins consideration of the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, Senators Collins and King will continue to pursue every opportunity to see the HUBZones provision pass into law. The Association of Defense Communities supports this bipartisan legislation."},

After the vote, Senator Collins released the following statement: \u201cI voted for the motion to begin debate today because the legislation included an extension of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) which expired at the end of 2014. This critical extension, which I co-authored with Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), has been essential to workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. In 2013 alone, more than 700 Mainers benefitted from the TAA programs. \u201cMy vote should not be construed as signifying support for either Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) or the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).\u00a0 I remain very skeptical about granting the President TPA as it paves the way for TPP, which could in turn threaten many American jobs. \u201cI am especially concerned about Maine\u2019s shoemaking jobs, some of which could be jeopardized by TPP.\u00a0 New Balance, for example, employs nearly 900 workers at three Maine factories.\u00a0 Every briefing that I have received on TPP has left me concerned that these workers could be severely disadvantaged by this trade deal.\u00a0I am concerned that TPP will end up penalizing companies like New Balance that have remained committed to American manufacturing, rather than moving all of their production jobs overseas.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNotwithstanding the vote today, unless it differs substantially from where it appears to be heading, I will very likely oppose TPP when it is considered by the Senate.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"},

{"title": "The Aging And Thriving In Place Movement", "date": ["Posted Fri, 05/15/2015 - 12:57"], "release": "It comes to no surprise that survey after survey indicates that most seniors would much rather stay in their own homes and communities to \u201cage in place\u201d and live independently as long as possible. Many seniors are far happier and much more comfortable in their own homes and near friends, family, and loved ones. While the population of seniors in our nation is increasing significantly, the number of both professional and family caregivers that can help care for seniors to enable them to age in place is decreasing. According to Census Bureau projections, 21 percent of the American population will be 65 and older by 2040, up from just under 14 percent in 2012. In fact, every day, 10,000 baby boomers turn sixty-five. Americans 85 and older are the fastest growing segment of our population. And this is the very population that is most at risk of multiple and interacting health problems that can lead to disability and need for long-term care. Today, there are seven caregivers for each person over 80 and at the highest risk of requiring long-term care. By 2030, there will be four, and by 2050, the number drops to fewer than three. As a result, in the future, more people will have to rely on fewer caregivers. Advances in technology may provide some solutions to these challenges. Many are familiar with the decades-old and well-known phrase, \u201cI\u2019ve fallen, and I can\u2019t get up.\u201d That phrase, of course, was an advertisement for a medical alert system that, for many years, was among the most advanced technologies available to help seniors stay in their homes. While many seniors still rely on this device, breakthroughs in modern technology have brought us a long, long way, providing new options for seniors and their families. Technological solutions can be cost-effective and tailored to meet the specific needs of a senior and his or her living situation. Companies that develop these technologies are starting to recognize the needs of seniors, and design products to meet these needs. It is very exciting that some important work related to research and development of technologies to help seniors age in place is taking place right here in Maine at the University of Maine\u2019s Center on Aging. The Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, recently held a hearing to examine how advances in technology can help seniors live independently and age in place. Dr. Carol Kim, Vice President for Research at the University of Maine, came to Washington to testify about UMaine\u2019s \u201cSuccessful Aging Initiative for Living,\u201d or SAIL, program. Dr. Kim knows all too well that Maine is the oldest state in the nation by median age. UMaine has done a great deal of work that would help seniors mitigate falls and lessen the impact of a fall. Falls are a leading cause of injury-related death among seniors, and a major reason why many seniors become unable to live independently. For example, the University is working to develop a clothing garment that would provide hip protection to help prevent a fracture upon a fall. The University is also working to develop \u201cnon-stigmatized\u201d protective head gear that has the appearance of a regular head band or baseball cap. Dr. Kim further described UMaine\u2019s work to develop a device that could be mounted on an individual\u2019s glasses to help detect edges, such as stairs or curbs, or benches that could create falling hazards. This technology would be particularly helpful to seniors who have limited mobility and eyesight challenges. To illustrate the great need for development of innovative devices, UMaine students visited with residents of an assisted living facility in Orono and ask them this question: \u201cWhat could we design that would help you in your daily lives?\u201d In just one hour, these seniors came up with 50 different ideas! Advances in technology now provide options to allow seniors to remain in their homes longer by monitoring their health status, detecting emergency situations, and notifying families and health care providers of potential changes in health status. Another witness at the Aging Committee\u2019s recent hearing, a caregiver, described how sensors helped both his mother and mother-in-law remain in their homes longer than they otherwise would have. A sensor on the refrigerator, for example, helped alert him to the fact that his mother-in-law, who suffers from dementia, was not eating. In addition to the peace of mind technology can provide, it can also save money. This caregiver believes that the technology that enabled his mother to stay in her home ultimately saved his family more than $300,000 by not having to move her into a nursing home. While it isn\u2019t a replacement for professional care or personal attention from family members, technology can help bridge the \u201ccare gap\u201d and extend the amount of time a person is able to live independently\u2014to help them age and thrive in place."},

In addition, we request that you formally delay the effective implementation and compliance date for the menu labeling regulations by at least one year from the current date of December 1, 2015.\u201d These new menu labeling requirements stem from a provision in the Affordable Care Act that calls for a national, uniform nutrition-disclosure standard for foodservice establishments, primarily intended for restaurants. The FDA first released draft regulations to implement this provision in 2011, however, the agency also unexpectedly incorporated grocery and convenience stores because of the food sold at deli counters, snack bars, salad bars, and other in-store options. The FDA, a sub-agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, published its final menu labeling regulations in December of 2014, and businesses currently have until December 2015 to comply with the regulations. By delaying the implementation and compliance date by at least a year, the agency would have more time to work with grocery stores, supermarkets, and other similar businesses to provide them with formal guidance to ensure that they fully understand and can comply with the regulations. May 12, 2015 The Honorable Sylvia Matthews Burwell Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Avenue, SW Washington, D.C. 20201 Dear Secretary Burwell: We write regarding the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) final rule entitled, \u201cFood Labeling; Nutrition Labeling of Standard Menu Items in Restaurants and Similar Retail Food Establishments.\u201d\u00a0 Specifically, we request that the agency formally delay the implementation and compliance date for menu labeling regulations at supermarkets, grocery stores and similar retail food establishments by at least one-year and not earlier than December 1, 2016. Since FDA published the final menu labeling regulations on December 1, 2014, to include chain restaurants as well as thousands of supermarkets and grocery stores, the agency has not provided adequate answers to questions or guidance for stakeholders impacted, especially supermarkets and grocery stores, to comply with the final rule\u2019s current December 1, 2015, effective date.\u00a0 Given that supermarkets and grocery stores were not previously regulated under any federal, state, or municipal menu labeling laws, the supermarket and grocery store industry has sought clarification from FDA regarding the scope and variety of items potentially categorized as \u201crestaurant-type\u201d foods, as well as answers to many technical issues, in order for compliance work to begin.\u00a0 In March, former FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg acknowledged that application of menu labeling to \u201crestaurant-like\u201d establishments is the most complicated aspect of the regulations, and acknowledged that additional stakeholder guidance is warranted.\u00a0 To that point, FDA has yet to provide this guidance to stakeholders, which has further compressed compliance time for stakeholders to review the rules, address outstanding issues, and comply with enforcement of the regulation by federal, state, and local health officials. We urge the FDA to further engage with the entire industry of stakeholders impacted by the menu labeling regulations to address outstanding issues and concerns.\u00a0 In addition, we request that you formally delay the effective implementation and compliance date for the menu labeling regulations by at least one year from the current date of December 1, 2015.\u00a0 Thank you in advance.\u00a0 We look forward to your positive reply."},

The bill now awaits consideration by the full Senate. After the bill\u2019s passage in the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Collins released the following statement: \u201cDespite increasingly strenuous fiscal constraints, this bipartisan legislation makes important investments for the next fiscal year in U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) research and development programs and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) water infrastructure projects. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that this bill would provide $46 million for offshore wind technology development and demonstration projects, including $6 million to advance alternative project designs. Under the leadership of the University of Maine and a world-class consortium, the Aqua Ventus deepwater offshore wind initiative, which was first competitively selected by DOE in 2012, and again in 2014, has been awarded funding under this demonstration program. \u201cAs other countries press forward on research and development for offshore wind technology, this investment is critical for keeping the United States competitive and positioning our nation as the global leader in clean-energy technologies. \u201cIn addition, I was pleased that my amendment with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island to increase funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program by $7 million was successful. Weatherization plays an important role in permanently reducing home energy costs for low-income families and seniors, and the bill would now provide $197 million for this important program. \u201cThe bill also makes important investments in our nation\u2019s water infrastructure, including $50 million for the operations and maintenance of Army Corps projects at our smaller ports and harbors. Ports and harbors are the economic lifeblood for many coastal communities in Maine, and I am encouraged with this increased investment.\u201d If adopted, this legislation would fund the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE), and other programs in fiscal year 2016."},
{"title": "Appropriations Committee Approves Funding For Renovations At Bangor Air National Guard Wing", "date": ["Posted Fri, 05/22/2015 - 07:27"], "release": "Washington, D.C. \u2013 Senator Susan Collins, a senior member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved $7.2 million to complete renovations of the Bangor Air National Guard Wing\u2019s fire and rescue facility. Senator Collins raised the importance of this funding during a March 2015 subcommittee hearing with the Air Force, and advocated for it with her Appropriations colleagues. The funding was approved during the Committee\u2019s consideration of the 2016 Fiscal Year Military Construction and Veterans Affairs spending bill that provides resources for veterans\u2019 benefits and programs and makes funding available for military construction projects. Senator Collins voted in favor of the bill, which was approved by a vote of 21 to 9 and now awaits final consideration by the full Senate. \u201cI\u2019m pleased that this bill would fund the urgently needed fire and crash rescue improvements at the 101st Air Refueling Wing in Bangor, supporting those who put their lives on the line to protect our nation,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cThis funding would facilitate the Wing\u2019s critical missions, such as providing air refueling support to United States Strategic Command as well as logistical and support services to the airport, Bangor community, and State of Maine.\u201d In addition to the Bangor Air National Guard Wing project, the measure allocates funding for many programs that would benefit Maine veterans. The bill includes $270 million in funding for the Office of Rural Health through which the Access Received Close to Home (ARCH) program is funded. ARCH ensures that rural veterans, who often have a difficult time accessing the regular VA health system, can receive care closer to where they live. Cary Memorial Hospital in Caribou is the site of one of the five ARCH pilot programs. The bill would also extend advance appropriations for certain veterans\u2019 benefit programs. A $63.3 billion funding allocation would go toward medical services, medical support, and compliance. For the first time ever, $104 billion would be allocated in advance for compensation and pension benefits. For state extended care facilities, $100 million has been allocated. This would benefit the Maine Veterans Homes as they care for Maine\u2019s veterans and their families. Senator Collins has visited Maine\u2019s Veterans Homes throughout the state. The bill also directs the VA to research the effects of Agent Orange and other toxic exposures to which some Maine National Guard members may have been exposed while training at Gagetown in New Brunswick, Canada. This report would ensure that veterans across the country have a full and fair accounting of the long-term health effects of such substances and the health services and benefits that they may be entitled to as a result. Other important areas addressed in this bill include funding for veterans\u2019 mental health care ($7.5 billion), women veterans\u2019 health care ($446 million), and funding for services to reduce veteran homelessness ($1.4 billion). \u201cI believe that this responsible bill is the best possible legislation given our current budgetary guidelines which require that we make tough choices,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cWe must do our best, however, to honor those who have served and sacrificed so much for their country. The programs and benefits available to our veterans are part of a commitment we must preserve.\u201d"},
{"title": "Honoring Our Heroes ", "date": ["Posted Fri, 05/22/2015 - 11:44"], "release": "More than a century and a half ago, as our nation faced its gravest crisis during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln spoke of the \u201cmystic cords of memory, stretching from every patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land.\u2019\u2019 From the founding of our great nation to the conflicts of today, the men and women of our armed forces strengthen those mystic cords. From generation to generation, they add new and everlasting strands of valor, devotion to duty, and sacrifice. This Memorial Day, throughout Maine and across America, we gather again to express our gratitude. In countless villages, small towns, and big cities, we raise our voices in song and bow our heads in prayer in honor of those who gave their all for each of us. As we do these things, we are again reminded that freedom is a gift purchased at the greatest possible price. As we come together in our shared gratitude, as we look down the rows of headstones, the flowers, and the flags, we see our history. It is a history written not by conquerors, but by ordinary men and women who answered the extraordinary call to defend liberty. Many brave American men and women have given their lives overseas fighting for the freedom of others. As retired General and former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, \u201cWe have asked for nothing in return except the ground to bury them in.\u201d As the recent loss of six Marines performing rescue operations following the earthquake in Nepal reminds us, our servicemembers also are courageous and committed humanitarians. The very origins of Memorial Day speak to these values. It is significant that a day dedicated to the deepest of human emotions \u2013 grief, remembrance and gratitude \u2013 began not by decree from any high authority, but with the spontaneous, heartfelt actions of ordinary people. As the Civil War ravaged the countryside and took an ever greater and more ghastly human toll, Confederate widows and grieving mothers began placing wildflowers on the graves of their loved ones, and on the graves of Union soldiers -- the loved ones of widows and mothers they did not know but with whom they shared a sacred bond. Union widows and grieving mothers soon adopted that custom. Those origins, those mystic cords, connect to our time. Were we to gather at any veterans\u2019 cemetery throughout America or abroad, in December, we would look down the rows of headstones decorated with rings of balsam and ribbons of red. The Wreaths Across America project is Maine\u2019s unique way of expressing the gratitude that is felt worldwide. As we honor the fallen, we also honor those who served and returned home, and those who serve today. One of my greatest privileges as a Senator has been the opportunities I\u2019ve had to visit our troops overseas, in Korea, in Kosovo, and three times in Iraq and Afghanistan. In them, I see the same courage and compassion that have been the true insignia of America\u2019s armed forces throughout our history. And while we thank our men and women in uniform, we also thank the families \u2013 the husbands and wives, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, and mothers and fathers \u2013 who endure the separation, the anxiety, and, all too often, the grief that is also part of freedom\u2019s price. We owe our veterans and their families our deepest gratitude. As a Senator, I am committed to ensuring that they have the care and services earned through their sacrifices and contributions. Memorial Day 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. In Europe, the final, bloody push into Nazi Germany led to VE Day. In the Pacific, the path to VJ Day went through horrifying battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa. One of my earliest childhood memories is of my father taking me to the Memorial Day parade in my hometown of Caribou. He would hoist me high upon his shoulders and from there, the best vantage point along the parade route, I would see the hats come off and the hands go over hearts as our Flag went by. Some years, he would wear his old Army jacket. It was not until many years later that I learned the terrible price he had paid for it \u2013 the Battle of the Bulge, the Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts. That quiet courage, that modest heroism, that desire to do nothing more after conflict\u2019s end but to return home to a peaceful and productive civilian life is part of the history we celebrate today. It is a history we see from the shoulders of generations of such Americans. Two and a half years after an inaugural address that reminded Americans of the ties that bind our nation together, President Lincoln gave what many regard as the first Memorial Day speech. It was given not on a warm May morning after the Civil War, but on a chilly November afternoon while the war raged on and the outcome remained in doubt. It was given in a place called Gettysburg. His words are as true today as they were all those decades ago: \u201cThe world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us\u2014that from these honored dead, we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.\u201d May God bless those who defend our freedom, and may God bless America."},
{"title": "Bill To Improve Health Care Access For Rural Veterans Passes The Senate", "date": ["Posted Fri, 05/22/2015 - 19:37"], "release": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 The Access to Community Care for Veterans Act of 2015, legislation co-sponsored by U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King, passed the United States Senate today by unanimous consent. This legislation would require the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to expand eligibility of the Choice Program to cover veterans who reside more than 40 miles driving distance from the closest VA facility that offers the specific care they need.\u00a0The bill must now be considered and passed by the House of Representatives before it can be sent to the President. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThis common-sense change is an enormous victory for veterans both in Maine and across our nation who often face barriers to accessing care, particularly those living in rural communities,\u201d said Senator Collins.\u00a0\u201cThis improved access would relieve many veterans who struggle with the time and effort it takes to drive long distances for specialty health services.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMaine\u2019s veterans deserve accessible, high-quality medical care \u2013 but too often obstacles like long drives or dangerous weather can stand in the way of a trip to the VA,\u201d Senator King said. \u201cBy allowing veterans to receive care outside of the VA and take advantage of health services provided by clinics in their local communities, we are ensuring that veterans have the type of flexibility necessary to best meet their individual health care needs. When our veterans have sacrificed so much for us, the least we can do is make sure that the government is a partner when it comes to getting medical care, not just another barrier \u2013 and that\u2019s what this fix helps accomplish.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In February, Senators Collins and King led a bipartisan group of 42 Senators in expressing concerns about the implementation of the Choice Program   Robert McDonald. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In March,   and discussed many issues important to Maine veterans, including the 40-mile rule as it relates to the Veterans Choice Card Program. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 One week later, the VA announced that it would make a critical change to the 40-mile rule, rejecting the \u201cas the crow flies,\u201d or a straight line distance measurement. With the change in calculating the actual distance that the veteran would have to travel, the number of eligible veterans nationwide who can receive care in their communities roughly doubles. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 While that change was an important first step, the Choice Card rules still did not consider the type of care available within 40 miles of where a veteran lives. In April, during a VA Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, Senator Collins raised this concern with Secretary McDonald, asking the VA to \u201cfurther expand eligibility of the Choice Program to cover veterans who reside more than 40 miles driving distance from the closest VA facility that offers the specific service sought by the veteran.\u201d The bill passed today by the Senate would direct the VA to make this necessary change. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Senators Collins and King joined Senators Jerry Moran (R-KS), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Ron Wyden (D-OR), in introducing the Access to Community Care for Veterans Act of 2015.\u00a0"},

Senator Susan Collins\u2019 remarks, as prepared for delivery:   \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Thank you, Brenda. \u00a0I'm proud to be a life member of the Ladies Auxiliary Post in Caribou. \u00a0First Lady LePage, Director Horn, men and women of America\u2019s armed forces, veterans, honored guests, and the loved ones of the fallen: I am honored to join you on this most solemn day.\u00a0 I thank the VFW Ladies Auxiliary for bringing us together so that we who enjoy the blessings of freedom may pay our deepest respect to those who have defended it.  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is an honor to share the podium today with so many who exemplify this respect, including Lt. Col. Gibson, the Maine Army National Guard Chaplain and two remarkable women, Anne LePage and Adria Horn. First Lady LePage doesn\u2019t just go the extra mile for the patriots who serve our country -- last summer she jumped 10,000 feet straight down with a parachute on her back for them.\u00a0   \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 During my years in the Senate, I have had the honor of having many veterans and service members on my staff.\u00a0 While I was sad to see her leave my Portland office, I am proud that Adria Horn, an Army reservist, recently became the Director of Maine\u2019s Bureau of Veterans\u2019 Services.\u00a0   \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 More than a century and a half ago, as our nation faced its gravest crisis, President Abraham Lincoln spoke of the \u201cmystic cords of memory, stretching from every patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land.\u2019\u2019  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 From the founding of our great nation to the conflicts of today, the men and women of our armed forces strengthen those mystic cords.\u00a0 From generation to generation, they add new and everlasting strands of valor, devotion to duty, and sacrifice.  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And throughout this nation, we gather today to express our gratitude.\u00a0 In countless villages, small towns, and big cities, we raise our voices in song and bow our heads in prayer in honor of those who gave their all for each of us.\u00a0 When we do so, we are reminded that freedom is a gift purchased at the greatest possible price.  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As we come together today in our shared gratitude, as we look down the rows of headstones, the flowers, and the flags, we see our history.\u00a0 It is a history written not by conquerors, but by ordinary men and women who answered the call to defend liberty.\u00a0 It is a history cherished not by a power seeking domination, but by a people seeking peace.\u00a0   \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Many brave American men and women have given their lives overseas fighting for the freedom of others.\u00a0 As retired General and former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, \u201cWe have asked for nothing in return except the ground to bury them in.\u201d  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As the recent loss of six Marines performing rescue operations following the earthquake in Nepal reminds us, our service members also are courageous and committed humanitarians.  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The very origins of Memorial Day speak to these values.\u00a0 It is significant that a day dedicated to the deepest of human emotions \u2013 grief, remembrance and gratitude \u2013 began not by decree from any high authority, but with the spontaneous, heartfelt actions of ordinary people.\u00a0   \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As the Civil War ravaged the countryside and took an ever greater and more ghastly human toll, Confederate widows and grieving mothers began placing wildflowers on the graves of their loved ones -- and on the graves of Union soldiers -- the loved ones of widows and mothers they did not know but with whom they shared an sacred bond. Union widows and grieving mothers soon adopted that custom.  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Those origins, those mystic cords, connect to our time.\u00a0 Were we to gather here, or at veterans\u2019 cemeteries throughout America or abroad, in December, we would look down the rows of headstones decorated with rings of balsam and ribbons of red.\u00a0 The Wreaths Across America project is Maine\u2019s unique way of expressing the gratitude that is felt worldwide.  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 On this day, as we honor the fallen, we also honor those who served and returned home, and those who serve today.\u00a0 One of my greatest privileges as a Senator has been the opportunities I\u2019ve had to visit our troops overseas, in Korea, in Kosovo, and three times in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u00a0 In them, I see the same courage and compassion that have been the true insignia of America\u2019s armed forces throughout our history.  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And while we thank our men and women in uniform, we also thank the families \u2013 the husbands and wives, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, and mothers and fathers \u2013 who endure the separation, the anxiety, and, all too often, the grief that is also part of freedom\u2019s price.\u00a0 We owe our veterans and their families our deepest gratitude.\u00a0 As a Senator, I am committed to ensuring that they have the care and the services they have so fully earned through their sacrifices and contributions.  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Memorial Day 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.\u00a0 In Europe, the final, bloody push into Nazi Germany led to VE Day.\u00a0 In the Pacific, the path to VJ Day went through horrifying battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa.\u00a0 Let me conclude with some thoughts about one of the heroes who is very special to me.  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 One of my earliest childhood memories is of my father taking me to the Memorial Day parade in my hometown of Caribou.\u00a0 He would hoist me high upon his shoulders and there, from the best vantage point along the parade route, I would see the hats come off and the hands go over hearts as our Flag went by.  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Some years, he would wear his old Army jacket.\u00a0 It was not until many years later that I learned the terrible price he had paid for it \u2013 the Battle of the Bulge, the Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts.\u00a0 That quiet courage, that modest heroism, that desire to do nothing more after conflict\u2019s end but to return home to a peaceful and productive civilian life is part of the history we celebrate today.\u00a0 It is a history we see from the shoulders of generations of such Americans.  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Two and a half years after an inaugural address that reminded Americans of the ties that bind our nation together, President Lincoln gave what many regard as the first Memorial Day speech. It was given not on a warm May morning after the Civil War, but on a chilly November afternoon while the war raged on and the outcome remained in doubt. It was given in a place called Gettysburg.\u00a0 His words, which so eloquently described the debt those who enjoy the great gift of freedom owe to those who secured it, are as true today as they were all those decades ago:  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us\u2014that from these honored dead, we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.\u201d  \u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 May God bless you all, and may God bless America."},

The hearing\u2019s witnesses included Brittany Dixon, a former homeless youth and current education technician from Auburn, Maine, and True Colors Fund Co-Founder and Grammy, Emmy and Tony Award winning artist, Cyndi Lauper. In her opening remarks, Senator Collins began by highlighting the severity of youth homelessness across America, stating the staggering statistic that, \u201cAccording to HUD\u2019s 2014 Point-in-Time (PIT) Count, there are more than 194,300 homeless children and youth, representing nearly one-third of all homeless people. Of this total, 45,205 were unaccompanied homeless children and youth, which is nearly eight percent of the total homeless population.\u201d Senator Collins continued, \u201cEnding youth homelessness requires cooperation and coordination across federal agencies, at different levels of government, and in partnership with the philanthropic and non-profit sector.\u201d Senator Collins also highlighted the importance of federal funding in Maine to help meet the needs of homeless youth, \u201cNew Beginnings in Lewiston, and the Preble Street Resource Center in Portland, have used these resources to connect young people who need food, safe shelter, health services, and educational support with those who can provide those services,\u201d said Senator Collins. Brittany Dixon, a former homeless youth from Auburn, gave powerful testimony on her personal experience with homelessness. After becoming homeless at 18 years old, Brittany was connected with New Beginnings, a non-profit organization that provides emergency services and transitional living programs for youth throughout the state of Maine. In her testimony, Brittany said, \u201cNew Beginnings provided many resources I could use to succeed, including assistance with college applications and financial aid\u2026 New Beginnings has helped me to develop critical life skills and to become self-sufficient.\u201d With guidance from the New Beginnings team, Brittany attended the University of Maine at Farmington and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Elementary Education. She now works full time as an Educational Technician for Washburn Elementary School in Auburn and is planning to become a kindergarten teacher. Brittany concluded her testimony by stating, \u201cPrograms that support homeless youth are important to so many young people like me. It gives young people the chance to have a safe place to stay while they get their footing and figure out what they want to do in their lives. It is important for every youth who faces homelessness to have funding for transitional and temporary programs that help them learn, be supported and have a safe place to stay. I didn\u2019t need to be supported forever, only until I could move to the next level for myself. Thank you for the opportunity to share my experience and for supporting programs like these.\u201d In the hearing, Senator Collins pointed to the importance of legislation such as the Runaway and Homeless Youth Trafficking Prevention Act, which despite receiving a majority vote, fell short of the 60-vote threshold required for inclusion in the final passage of the anti-trafficking bill last week.

While the personal care products industry is projected to exceed $60 billion in U.S. revenue this year, federal regulations on these products have not been updated in 75 years. The bill, which is the result of numerous discussions with stakeholders and extensive consultation with the FDA, is supported by the following companies: The bill is also supported by the following consumer groups: \u201cI am pleased to be working with Senator Feinstein on legislation to modernize FDA regulation of cosmetics and personal care products, which are widely used by consumers often on a daily basis,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cBy improving FDA oversight of the ingredients in cosmetics and personal care products, this legislation aims to protect consumers while also providing regulatory certainty for manufacturers, enabling them to plan for the future.\u201d \u201cFrom shampoo to lotion, the use of personal care products is widespread, however, there are very few protections in place to ensure their safety,\u201d said Senator Feinstein. \u201cEurope has a robust system, which includes consumer protections like product registration and ingredient reviews. I am pleased to be introducing this bipartisan legislation with Senator Collins that will require FDA to review chemicals used in these products and provide clear guidance on their safety. In addition, the legislation has broad support from companies and consumer groups alike.\u201d Consumer and health advocates are concerned about the use and concentration of some chemicals in personal care products. For example, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, short-term exposure to formaldehyde, which is used in smoothing hair treatments, has been reported to cause a range of negative health effects. Initially, these can include headaches and shortness of breath in consumers and the professionals who apply the chemicals. However, long-term exposure to formaldehyde has been associated with increased risk of cancer, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires salon owners to provide their workers with protective equipment, including masks and goggles, when applying this chemical. In another example, propyl paraben, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products, mimics estrogen and may be appropriate only in certain concentrations. According to scientific studies, chemicals that mimic estrogen can disrupt the endocrine system and have been linked to a wide range of health effects, including reproductive system disorders. The bill would require the FDA to evaluate a minimum of five ingredients per year to determine their safety and appropriate use \u2013 the two chemicals mentioned above are among those to be reviewed in the first year. The review process set forth in the bill would provide companies with clear guidance about whether ingredients should continue to be used and if so, what the concentration levels should be and whether consumer warnings are needed. For example, a chemical may be deemed inappropriate for use in children\u2019s products, or appropriate for professional application only. The first set of chemicals for review includes: The bill would provide streamlined federal standards so that the personal care products industry knows what to expect and companies can plan for the future with certainty.

Specifically, Senator Collins stated that she was \u201cpleased to see the Administration continue to highlight the importance of the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery Program (TIGER),\u201d but was disappointed that the President\u2019s budget used gimmicks and unrealistic channels to fund this important program. Senator Collins went on to say that she has \u201cadvocated for TIGER since joining the Appropriations Committee in 2009 and seen first-hand how this program supports economic growth and job creation, nationally, regionally, and locally. It has been essential to many bridge, railroad, and port projects in my home state of Maine that would not have otherwise been undertaken when they needed to be.\u201d Since 2009, Senator Collins has been able to successfully secure more than $90 million through the TIGER program for key projects throughout the state of Maine, including the replacements of bridges in Kittery, Dresden-Richmond, and Rumford, and the breakwater in Eastport. Given the increase in transportation of crude oil by rail, Chairman Collins questioned Secretary Foxx about the need to finalize the rulemaking regarding tank cars and oil spill response plans. Senator Collins underscored the tragic incident that occurred two years ago in Lac Megantic, a Canadian town which is near the Maine border, as evidence for the necessity of regulations that would require comprehensive oil spill response plans for all railroads that transport crude oil. In response, Secretary Foxx noted that he shared Senator Collins\u2019 concerns and that the Department takes this issue very seriously.

As part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program, this funding will go towards targeted vouchers that offer permanent supportive housing opportunities to veterans experiencing homelessness.

The federal law that ensure the ingredients in these products are safe has not been updated in more than 75 years. Understandably, there is significant concern from consumer groups, manufacturers, and health professionals alike that the current system fails to protect consumer safety. Individual consumers and salon professionals should have the ability to evaluate whether the products they are applying to skin or using to wash hair are safe, just as they have the right to know that the foods they are consuming are safe. For instance, propyl paraben, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products, mimics the female hormone estrogen, and concerns have been raised that it may be appropriate only in certain concentrations. According to scientific studies, chemicals that mimic estrogen can disrupt the endocrine system and have been linked to a wide range of health effects, including reproductive system disorders. Similarly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, short-term exposure to formaldehyde, which is used in certain hair treatments, has been reported to cause a range of negative health effects. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires salon owners to provide their workers with protective equipment, including masks and goggles, when applying this chemical. Exposure may initially include headaches and shortness of breath in consumers and the professionals who apply the chemicals, and long-term exposure has been associated with increased risk of cancer. The United States has fallen behind in establishing a modern regulatory process for personal care products. Europe, on the other hand, has a robust system, which includes consumer protections like product registration and ingredient review. This April, I joined Senator Dianne Feinstein in introducing bipartisan legislation that would give the FDA broader oversight on personal care products by setting up a basic regulatory structure, with registration of manufacturers and products, and a uniform national standard. Under our bill, companies would report adverse health events, follow good manufacturing practices, and keep safety records. The FDA would be required to review at least five ingredients used in personal care products each year to ensure their safety and appropriate use, including what concentration levels are appropriate and whether consumer warnings are needed. For example, a chemical may be deemed inappropriate for use in children\u2019s products, but appropriate for professional application. Using the model that is currently in place for medical devices and pharmaceuticals, the legislation would be fully paid for by user fees from the companies that register. This bill has broad support from personal care product manufacturers, such as Proctor & Gamble, Johnson and Johnson, Revlon, Estee Lauder, Unilever, and L\u2019Oreal. Similarly, a wide range of consumer groups have expressed support for the bill, including the Environmental Working Group, Society for Women\u2019s Helath Research, National Alliance for Hispanic Health, and HealthyWoman. By modernizing the oversight of personal care products, consumers will be better protected and companies will have better regulatory certainty. I look forward to continuing to work closely with Senator Feinstein to get this important and common-sense legislation passed."},

The trade case, which was initiated by the U.S. Coalition for Fair Paper Imports and includes Madison Paper Industries, is targeted toward the extensive subsidies received by Port Hawkesbury Paper in Nova Scotia. Senators Collins and King and Congressman Poliquin strongly support the ongoing investigation. \u201cThis investigation is vitally important to Madison Paper Industries, which produces supercalendered paper in Maine and employs 200 workers in a rural area of our state,\u201d Senators Collins and King and Congressman Poliquin wrote. In January 2015, Senators Collins and King and Congressman Poliquin   urging her to do everything legally within her power to address this issue and stop these unfair Canadian trade practices in the paper market. In February, Senator Collins  during a hearing about these ongoing subsidies. On the same day, the Coalition filed a petition seeking a countervailing duty investigation regarding supercalendered paper from Canada. In April, the lawmakers also wrote to the International Trade Commission in support of the trade case against Port Hawkesbury. On April 10, 2015, the Department of Commerce announced that it would investigate extensive Canadian subsidies that are unfairly harming U.S. producers of supercalendered paper, including Madison Paper Industries (MPI) located in Madison, ME. At present, the Department will investigate Port Hawkesbury Paper in Nova Scotia and Resolute Forest Products in Quebec, but will not include the other two producers of supercalendared paper in Canada: Catalyst Paperin British Columbia, which recently acquired a paper mill in Rumford, Maine, that employs 800 workers, and Irving Paper in New Brunswick. Because they are not currently being investigated by the Department of Commerce, Catalyst and Irving are likely to be assigned a duty rate that is largely based upon the massive Port Hawkesbury subsidies. \u201cIn support of a fair and fact-based investigation, we urge you to investigate all four Canadian supercalendered paper producers within the current timeframe\u2026 In doing so, we strongly encourage the Department to dedicate any additional resources as necessary to ensure that the quality of the investigation is not jeopardized,\u201d the lawmakers continued. \u201cWe believe these steps are the surest way to protect the jobs at the Madison mill, ensure the financial health of the mill in Rumford, and provide an appropriate remedy for foreign subsidies that make it difficult, if not impossible, for American mills to compete.\u201d  or read the full text of the letter below: The Honorable Penny Pritzker Secretary of Commerce U.S. Department of Commerce 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20230 Dear Secretary Pritzker: The Department of Commerce is currently conducting a countervailing duty investigation of supercalendered paper from Canada (Case no. C-122-854), an investigation we strongly support and ask to be concluded without delay. This investigation is vitally important to Madison Paper Industries, which produces supercalendered paper in Maine and employs 200 workers in a rural area of our state. We are concerned, however, that the Department has selected as mandatory respondents only two of the four producers of supercalendered paper in Canada. This decision could negatively affect the two businesses that were not selected as mandatory respondents, both of which employ hundreds of Maine workers. On April 10, 2015, the Department announced that it would investigate Port Hawkesbury Paper in Nova Scotia and Resolute Forest Products in Quebec. Since 2012, Members of Congress have raised serious concern about the extensive subsidies received by Port Hawkesbury Paper that are harming U.S. producers of supercalendered paper, including Madison Paper Industries. We fully support the Department\u2019s decision to select both Port Hawkesbury Paper and Resolute Forest Products as mandatory respondents. We are concerned, however, that the Department declined to investigate Irving Paper in New Brunswick and Catalyst Paper in British Columbia, which recently acquired a paper mill in Rumford, Maine, that employs 800 workers. If the Department fails to individually investigate Catalyst and Irving, these two companies will be subject to a duty rate that is unrelated to any actual subsidies that they may have received. These companies would instead be subject to what is known as the \u201call others\u201d rate, which would reflect the average of the subsidies received by Port Hawkesbury Paper and Resolute Forest Products. To ensure that each company\u2019s duty rate reflects any subsidies that company may have received, we respectfully ask that the Department investigate each Canadian producer of supercalendered paper and assess individual duty rates accordingly. Moreover, we believe that the Department\u2019s decision to limit its inquiry only to Port Hawkesbury Paper and Resolute Forest Products may be inconsistent with the law governing countervailing duty investigations. We understand that the Department is required by statute to calculate an individual subsidy margin for every known producer in a given country, but may select fewer respondents only if a country has a \u201clarge number\u201d of producers. We respectfully disagree with the Department\u2019s position that four \u2013 the number of supercalendered paper producers in Canada \u2013 is a large number. In fact, the Court of International Trade has ruled on three occasions that four respondents is not a large number. It would be unfair and inconsistent with statutory regulations governing countervailing duty investigations, as well as Court of International Trade precedent, to select only two of four possible mandatory respondents in this case. In support of a fair and fact-based investigation, we urge you to investigate all four Canadian supercalendered paper producers within the current timeframe established for this investigation, which calls for a preliminary determination by July 27, 2015, and a final determination 75 days thereafter. In doing so, we strongly encourage the Department to dedicate any additional resources as necessary to ensure that the quality of the investigation is not jeopardized. We also urge the Department to reject any attempt to treat these subsidies as \u201cupstream\u201d or other efforts that would lead to any delay in the existing case. To that end, both Catalyst and Irving have affirmed to us, in writing, that they will not ask the International Trade Administration for an upstream subsidy investigation if they are accepted as mandatory respondents. We believe these steps are the surest way to protect the jobs at the Madison mill, ensure the financial health of the mill in Rumford, and provide an appropriate remedy for foreign subsidies that make it difficult, if not impossible, for American mills to compete. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter."},

The Maine Track Program was created to accomplish three goals: to address the shortage of doctors in Maine, especially in our rural areas; to offer Maine\u2019s brightest students the financial means to pursue a career in medicine; and to develop an innovative curriculum focused on community-based education. The program was established through an educational partnership between Tufts University School of Medicine and Maine Medical Center. This unique partnership offers a rigorous training program focused on the needs of Maine while also giving students firsthand experience providing care in local communities throughout the state. See below for a full copy of Senator Collins\u2019 remarks, as prepared for delivery Senator Susan M. Collins May 2, 2015 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you, Dr. Bates.\u00a0Members of the Maine Medical Center and Tufts University School of Medicine communities, families, and friends, it is a pleasure to be with you today. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMost of all, congratulations to this outstanding Maine Track Class of 2015.\u00a0 I am honored to be part of this special moment in your lives. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cIt is wonderful to share the podium today with another Aroostook native, Caleb Swanberg.\u00a0 It is even more wonderful to know that, after his residency, he intends to return to our hometown of Caribou to apply his knowledge and dedication. \u00a0All of you who follow the path to the practice of rural medicine \u2013 whether in the town you are from or someplace new \u2013 will find a community that is warm, welcoming, and deeply grateful for your commitment. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cTo illustrate, I want to tell you the story of my Uncle Doug Collins.\u00a0 A graduate of the University of Maine and Harvard Medical School, my Uncle could have practiced anywhere after his residency in internal medicine at Mass General.\u00a0 He chose to come home to Caribou where he practiced for many years and was known to be particularly gifted at diagnosis, a skill that was honed by taking care of generations of the same family.\u00a0 He once spared a very elderly patient from a lung biopsy by being able to tell the specialist that the spot on the man\u2019s lung had been there unchanged for decades and had been present in the patient\u2019s father\u2019s lung too.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cAfter many years of practicing in Caribou, he became one of the first directors of the Maine-Dartmouth Family Medicine program in Augusta.\u00a0 He enjoyed getting the program established and teaching.\u00a0 But eventually the pull of his patients was just too strong, and after several years, he returned to Caribou where he practiced until he retired.\u00a0 His patients loved him, and he loved them. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cHe was well-respected not only by his patients but also by his fellow physicians.\u00a0 Years ago, I met Surgeon General David Satcher who asked after my Uncle Doug and commented that they had worked together on an Institute of Medicine study. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cLike my Uncle Doug, the same sense of compassion and the desire to be of service that led you to the field of medicine in the first place is guiding you to your next destination.\u00a0 I hope it will be in Maine, in a community where you, too, will love your patients and they will love you.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe story of how the Maine Track program came to be is a great example of the kind of practical thinking that produces solutions.\u00a0 In 2008, a longstanding problem in Maine health care was becoming a crisis.\u00a0 Nearly a quarter of all Maine physicians were nearing retirement.\u00a0 Fourteen of our 16 counties were designated by the federal government as medically underserved areas.\u00a0 Our State trailed the nation \u2013 in 49th place that year, 50th in others -- in the number of students applying to medical schools, with the leading cause being financial barriers. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cDr. Bates, the administration, and the trustees at Maine Medical Center joined forces with Dean Harris Berman and his colleagues at Tufts to craft a visionary, three-pronged solution:\u00a0 recruit high-achieving Maine students to careers in medicine, help to make a medical education affordable, and encourage graduates to practice in rural communities.\u00a0 Community hospitals across our State agreed to host the hands-on training that proves a quality medical education can be gained in a rural setting.\u00a0\u00a0 Scholarships made possible by support from individuals, businesses, foundations, and the State of Maine were established to overcome the financial barriers.\u00a0 The Maine Track program was launched in 2009, and today we celebrate its third class. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWith the exception of this Celebration, probably the most exciting \u2013 and certainly the most nerve-wracking -- day in the life of a medical student is Match Day, when resident positions are offered.\u00a0 While the first Maine Track graduates, the Class of 2013, are still in their residencies in Maine and across the nation, the outlook is very encouraging.\u00a0 On average over the first three years of the program, one-third of Maine Track students sought and obtained residencies in our State.\u00a0 In addition, many who took residencies elsewhere say they intend to return to Maine.\u00a0 These are powerful indications that Maine Track is on the right track.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe qualities of compassion and vision that got us here are invaluable, but as a matter of public policy, we must continue to address the distinct challenges faced by rural communities and their implications for health care. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThe Maine Track program helps many students afford a medical education, but that affordability remains the single greatest impediment to graduate education.\u00a0 Far too many medical students already carry significant debt from their undergraduate years which, when combined with the high cost of medical school, makes the higher-paying positions of urban or suburban settings not just desirable, but often necessary. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThat is why the National Health Service Corps\u2019 scholarship and loan repayment programs are so important.\u00a0 Not only do they make the high cost of medical school more affordable, they also help communities struggling with shortages of key health care professionals.\u00a0 As a Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue to work hard to increase funding for these programs so that Mainers have better access to quality health care. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cWe also need to ensure that rural practitioners do not feel cut off from their colleagues and the latest research.\u00a0 Telemedicine, including remote patient monitoring, offers great promise in closing this gap, but our nation must do more to expand broadband access.\u00a0 Maine has long been in the forefront of telehealth initiatives, but during your nine-month clerkships in rural hospitals, some of you students may have noticed that the Information Superhighway still has some potholes. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou know that rural America presents some particular challenges, such as higher rates of smoking, diabetes, and poverty.\u00a0 Substance abuse and mental health issues are problems everywhere, but they are exacerbated in rural communities due to a lack of treatment options and, in some cases, by cross-border smuggling operations.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMany of you are also likely to encounter the tsunami of Alzheimer\u2019s cases in your practices.\u00a0 Alzheimer\u2019s is the only one of our nation\u2019s top ten deadliest diseases without an effective means of prevention, treatment or cure.\u00a0 That is why I support a dramatic increase in our federal investment in Alzheimer\u2019s research.\u00a0 At a time when the United States is spending $226 billion a year to care for Alzheimer\u2019s patients, we are spending less than $600 million a year on research.\u00a0 We currently spend $5.4 billion a year for cancer research, $3 billion a year for research on HIV/AIDS, and $2 billion for cardiovascular research, all investments that have paid dividends.\u00a0 Surely we can do more for Alzheimer\u2019s given its tremendous human and economic price. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cOur health care system now stands directly in the path of a tidal wave of aging baby boomers who will be retiring at the rate of 10,000 a day for the next 20 years. And Maine is the state with the oldest median age in the nation.\u00a0 That system will clearly have to adapt to survive the impact.\u00a0 Physicians will be on the front lines of these changes. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI cite these issues fully confident that they will not discourage you in the least from rural medicine.\u00a0 In fact, I am quite certain each of you can add to the list.\u00a0 Consider this, instead, a long compliment of the highest degree: you know the challenges and are eager, trained, and ready to take them on.\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cMany of you are drawn to rural practice in part by the quality of life \u2013 outdoor recreation, natural beauty, friendly people, and safe communities.\u00a0 So consider this as well: you will be adding immeasurably to that quality of life by your very presence.\u00a0 You will make a real difference. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI often conclude remarks at celebrations such as this by urging the students to stay in Maine after graduation.\u00a0 As you head off to your residencies, some of you will do just that, while others will get a glimpse of our State in your rear view mirror.\u00a0 If that is the case, drive safely and know that we look forward to the day when you will once again be looking at this beautiful and welcoming place through your windshield. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThank you, Class of 2015, congratulations and good luck.\u201d"},
{"title": "Helping America\u2019s Homeless Youth Find Their Confidence And Voice", "date": ["Posted Sun, 05/03/2015 - 13:50"], "release": "Every night, hundreds of thousands of homeless children and youth are homeless. That is nearly one-third of the entire homeless population. Even more shocking is the fact that tens of thousands of children and teens face the danger and despair of homelessness alone, unaccompanied by a parent or guardian. It is important to note that these distressing federal statistics reflect a survey of a single point in time in 2014. The reality is that many more young people find themselves homeless for a period of time throughout the course of a year. In fact, the Department of Education\u2019s most recent data reported that more than 1.2 million students experienced homelessness at some point during the 2012-2013 school year, including 75,940 unaccompanied youth. As Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee with oversight of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, I recently chaired a hearing to assess the Department\u2019s efforts to prevent and end youth homelessness. In 2010, the Administration set the goal of preventing and ending child and youth homelessness by 2020. This hearing addressed two important purposes. The first was to help increase Congress\u2019 understanding of how federal programs can be strengthened to better support homeless youth while operating within the tight financial constraints we face. The second was to explore partnerships since successfully ending youth homelessness cannot be done through federal funds alone. Ending youth homelessness requires cooperation and coordination across federal agencies, at different levels of government, and in partnership with the philanthropic and non-profit sector and families. Two of our hearing witnesses made just that point with testimony that was personal and powerful. One was Brittany Dixon of Auburn, Maine. The other, was the world-famous, award-winning singer Cyndi Lauper. Both of these remarkable women overcame homelessness as teens to build productive lives and to serve others. Both were helped through those extraordinarily difficult years by the public-private partnerships we must cultivate and support. Brittany Dixon may not be as famous as Cyndi Lauper, but she is certainly just as inspiring. Left homeless at age 18, she told the Subcommittee, \u201cNothing can prepare a teenager for the overwhelming and frightening feelings of being alone and having nowhere to go and no one to turn to.\u201d With the aid of the domestic violence help line Safe Voices, Brittany was referred to New Beginnings, an outstanding Lewiston-based organization that provides emergency services and transitional living programs for youth throughout the state of Maine. New Beginnings helped her regain a sense of safety and the security of having a place to call home, and provided her with other resources to succeed \u2013 from assistance with college applications to developing such life skills as living on a budget, shopping wisely, and using public transportation. Most important, New Beginnings helped Ms. Dixon develop self-esteem and confidence. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Maine Farmington at 2013, now supports herself as an educational technician at an elementary school in Auburn, and aspires to teach kindergarten. As for her journey to self-reliance, she told the Subcommittee this: \u201cI didn\u2019t need to be supported forever, only until I could move to the next level for myself.\u201d Ms. Lauper also shared her personal story as a homeless teen. With the help of a youth hostel program, she got off the streets, earned her GED, and with talent and hard work, became a successful singer and songwriter. Ms. Lauper also told the Subcommittee she uses her \u201cbig voice\u201d to speak for disenfranchised youth. She is the co-founder of the True Colors Fund, which works nationally to end homelessness among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth. While only 7 percent of the overall youth population is LGBT, they comprise up to 40 percent of homeless teens and young adults. True Colors currently is working with federal agencies in Houston and Cincinnati to develop local, community-based youth homelessness prevention plans that can be models of collaboration nationwide. Homeless youth are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation, of which there have been horrifying cases here in Maine and across the nation. Ms. Lauper is an eloquent supporter of the bipartisan Runaway and Homeless Youth Trafficking Prevention Act that I cosponsored to strengthen critical preventive and treatment services. While this important legislation has failed to advance in the Senate, despite receiving a majority vote, I will continue to advocate for its passage. The importance of federal funding to support local efforts is clear here in Maine. New Beginnings in Lewiston, Shaw House in Bangor, and the Preble Street Resource Center in Portland are among those that have used federal resources to connect young people who need food, safe shelter, health services, and educational support with those who can provide those services. The inspiring stories of Brittany Dixon and Cyndi Lauper are strong evidence that collaboration among the various levels of government and local initiatives can truly make a difference in the lives of the most vulnerable among us."},

Precision medicine is an exciting approach to disease prevention and treatment that effectively tailors medical treatment to the individual genetic profile of each patient.\u00a0\u00a0 In his 2015 State of the Union Address, President Obama unveiled   of a Precision Medicine Initiative which would set the foundation for a new model of patient-powered research to better understand health and disease through a cohort of one million or more patient volunteers. In the hearing, Senator Collins questioned Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the National Institute of Health, about concerns she heard from brain tumor research advocates from Maine representing the National Brain Tumor Society. The Senator also asked whether there is \u201ca role for precision medicine in neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and ALS.\u201d To this question, Dr. Collins answered in part, \u201cfor any disease that is common enough that you are going to have thousands in your one million strong cohort, you will have an opportunity to study those on a scale that has not been previously possible\u2026I think one of the exciting aspects of having this very large cohort is that it doesn\u2019t have to be just about heart disease, or just about diabetes, or just about Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It can be about all of those things because it will have the scale to do so.\u00a0 We have waited a long time to reach the point where the technology would make that possible and the time is now.

Excerpts from today\u2019s profile can be read below: Maine\u2019s Susan Collins a force for consensus By Jessica Meyers May 6, 2015 WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate\u2019s first attempt at regular bipartisan lunches this year began with a telling choice: the tastes of Maine. \u2026 The ingredients for this buffet of good will came from the home state of Senator Susan Collins, a Republican long known for her moderate views and willingness to find compromise. \u2026 As senators struggle to pass even innocuous bills, Collins is emerging as a lifeline for moderate Democrats and a counterbalance to the GOP\u2019s right flank \u2014 a catalyst for compromise in a sea of intractable ideologies. \u2026 The sedate, 62-year-old senator, heralded for her help defusing the 2013 government shutdown, quickly dove into the Senate\u2019s thorniest issues after Republicans took control in January. When lawmakers nearly failed to fund the Department of Homeland Security in February over a dispute about President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, Collins introduced a bill that separated immigration from the rest of the spending measure. Her legislation augmented a broader deal that prevented a partial department shutdown. Her negotiating skills also helped break a Senate logjam this month over abortion language in a bipartisan bill to combat sex-trafficking. Collins and Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, proposed a method to pull the abortion reference out of the bill. The move helped propel the negotiations that led to the bill\u2019s unanimous passage last month and broke a GOP blockade of the nomination for attorney general. \u2026 \u201cShe\u2019s been steadfast in her ability to operate independently,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s even more important now.\u201d \u2026 \u201cI see my role as someone who has credibility with senators on both sides, who deals in good faith, and . . . is willing to put the time in to figure out what matters most to each side,\u201d Collins said. \u2026 Numerous senators credit Collins for easing the Senate past a 2013 government shutdown over the federal budget that stretched more than two weeks. Collins recalls sitting in her office \u2014 alone, because her staff had been furloughed. She got up and walked to the Senate floor, where she implored lawmakers to work with her on a compromise. The Common Sense Coalition was born, sparking a discussion that helped end the stalemate. ... Those kinds of big breakthroughs are rare. Collins\u2019s compromises are often a steppingstone to consensus rather than the deal itself. And while she points to the Senate\u2019s 20 women as fellow collaborators, the one major issue they have united on \u2013 human trafficking legislation \u2013 stalled for weeks on the Senate floor. \u2026 \u201cJust the ability to have a certain air of civility and to be able to have conversations and establish relationships, that is the basis to solving real problems,\u201d said Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat who helped create the supper group. \u2026 Placement on key committees also enhances her negotiating power. Collins heads the Special Committee on Aging, leads a transportation subcommittee on the highly influential Appropriations Committee, and sits on the health and select intelligence committees. \u2026 To read the full article, click  ."},
{"title": "Senator Collins\u2019 Statement Following Passage Of Conference Report On Budget Resolution", "date": ["Posted Wed, 05/06/2015 - 14:47"], "release": "Washington, DC\u2014 U.S. Senator Susan Collins issued the following statement after her vote in support of the conference agreement on the Budget Resolution, which passed the Senate by a vote of 51-48 today: \u201cFor the first time since 2009, both the Senate and House of Representatives have successfully passed a joint congressional framework to get our nation\u2019s overwhelming debt under control. Despite my disagreement with certain parts of the final conference agreement on the Budget Resolution, I ultimately determined that it was important to move forward and establish priorities to address our massive $18 trillion debt. \u201cWithout a budget, deficits will continue to expand, and the debt will continue to grow. Failure to pass a budget would keep our nation on a dangerous trajectory where by the year 2025, interest payments on the debt will be the third largest expenditure in the federal budget, exceeded by only Social Security and Medicare. \u201cWhile the budget agreement is not the one I would have written, many troubling provisions have been abandoned through the bipartisan conference process such as the House\u2019s proposal to shift to a premium support system for Medicare. \u201cI am pleased that the budget recognizes the serious and growing threats around the world and allows for increased expenditures to support training for our troops and equipment maintenance to ensure that our military can remain prepared to meet current and future threats. \"While this budget is a positive first step, more work is needed. Congress must make decisions and set priorities to meet the needs of the American people, not based on arbitrary caps or formulas such as the harmful, across-the-board cuts that result from sequestration. As the budget framework moves forward, Congress must come together and develop a bipartisan budget solution to ensure this is the case. \u201cAlthough I remain concerned about the failure to invest in a number of domestic priorities, even an imperfect budget will help to guide Congress through the appropriations process and set priorities when spending bills are considered. \u201cI will continue to work diligently to bridge the partisan divide and forge solutions that will address the many challenges we face as a nation.\u201d"},
{"title": "Addressing Aging Issues In Maine And Across Our Nation", "date": ["Posted Fri, 04/10/2015 - 12:51"], "release": "I recently had the opportunity to speak at the 10th Annual Geriatrics Day Conference at Maine Medical Center in Portland. The fact that this is often a sold-out conference with a waiting list illustrates the importance of aging issues to medical professionals throughout our State. With Maine being the oldest state in the nation by median age, the active involvement of health care providers is essential, and it was an honor to meet with them. Maine\u2019s growing population of older individuals, the rapidly changing demographics of our nation, and the challenges created by these changes are among the reasons why I pursued a leadership position on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, a Committee on which I have served since I joined the Senate. Throughout its history, this committee has spurred Congress to action on issues important to older Americans through its hearings, investigations, and reports. One disease that takes a tremendous toll on far too many of our older citizens is diabetes. As the co-chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have learned a great deal about this terrible disease that affects 29 million Americans. It also has a cost to our nation of $174 billion and consumes nearly one out of three Medicare dollars. Fortunately, we have seen some encouraging breakthroughs and are on the threshold of a number of important new discoveries. This is particularly true for the estimated 1.2 million Americans living with type 1 diabetes. Advances in technology, like continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), are helping patients control their blood glucose levels, which is key to preventing costly and sometimes deadly diabetes complications. We are also moving closer and closer to our goal of an artificial pancreas, which would control blood glucose levels automatically and revolutionize diabetes care. The National Institute of Health and the Food and Drug Administration have been extremely supportive of these innovations in diabetes care. I was therefore troubled to learn that insulin-dependent Medicare beneficiaries are being denied coverage for continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs. More than 90 percent of private insurers cover CGMs, yet Medicare lags behind and does not do so. To fix this problem, I have joined New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen in introducing legislation to create a separate benefit category under Medicare for these monitors. It simply makes no sense that Medicare does not provide coverage for CGMs, and I am working to change this policy. Another important issue is home care and hospice. Our health care system now stands directly in the path of a tidal wave of aging baby boomers who will be retiring at the rate of 10,000 a day for the next 20 years. That system will clearly have to adapt and change if it is to survive the impact. One of the most important things we can do is to shift our orientation from institutional to community and home-based care, where appropriate. Advances in technology and medical practice have made it possible for older adults who previously would have been hospitalized or moved into a nursing home to stay just where they want to be, in the comfort, privacy and security of their own homes. Yet, Medicare beneficiaries continue to face unnecessary barriers in getting home health services. To ensure that our Medicare patients get the home care they need, when they need it, I have introduced the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act to allow advance practice nurses and physician assistants to order home health care for their Medicare patients. I have also introduced legislation to extend the modest increase in payments for home health services in rural areas that otherwise will expire on January 1 of next year. The delivery of home health services in rural areas can be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly because of the extra travel time required to cover long distances between patients, higher transportation expenses, and other factors. If this rural payment is not extended, agencies may be forced to decline service to rural patients with greater care needs. Not long ago, I participated in a National Action Conference on End-of-Life Care. This can be a difficult topic for many families to address. Too many Americans fail to plan for their health care, and, as a result, their care may not be what they would have chosen. Working with former Senator Jay Rockefeller, I authored the law to include a discussion regarding advance care planning during the initial physician visit to which all Medicare beneficiaries are entitled. We must do more, however, to encourage families to have these important discussions, difficult as they may be. Among my highest priorities as Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee is to ensure that the goals set forth in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer\u2019s disease are achieved. That is why I recently authored a bipartisan amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution that calls for an increase in our federal investment in Alzheimer\u2019s research. I have also been joined by my colleague, Senator Amy Klobuchar, in introducing a resolution declaring that that the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer\u2019s by 2025 is an \u201curgent national priority.\u201d Our resolution calls on the Senate to double the amount of funding the United States spends on Alzheimer\u2019s in fiscal year 2016 and develop a plan to meet the target of $2 billion in research funding recommended by experts. According to Alzheimer\u2019s Association, if the federal government were to invest this amount, it would recoup its investment within the first three years a treatment or means of prevention becomes available. As I presided over a recent Committee hearing on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the packed hearing room was filled with hundreds of Alzheimer\u2019s advocates from throughout the nation, including many from Maine, who wore the color purple to symbolize their support for finding a cure. This \u201csea of purple\u201d served as a stark reminder that 5 million Americans suffer from a disease for which there is no cure, no effective treatments, and no means of prevention. The color purple currently represents support for Alzheimer\u2019s research, the patients and their families. I hope that someday the color purple will be worn by Alzheimer\u2019s survivors. The changing demographics of our nation will affect every facet of our society. But at the heart of it all is the work that medical professionals do day in and day out. I applaud them for their expertise, dedication, and compassion."},

The address, \u201cIncivility and Hyperpartisanship: Is Washington a Symptom or a Cause,\u201d discussed the prevalence of polarization, division, and dysfunction in our nation\u2019s capital and how we can address these challenges to achieve progress. In her speech, Senator Collins stressed the need for civility and respect for differing viewpoints in our effort to find solutions in our communities and in our government, \u201cIn Washington, we who represent the people of this great nation must put progress over partisanship, statesmanship over stridency, and compromise over conflict. That would produce a very different legislative climate, one in which the objective is to solve the problem, not just to score political points.\u201d First elected in 1996, Senator Collins is currently serving her 4th term in the U.S. Senate where she is known for her work in facilitating bipartisan compromise. The full text of Senator Collins\u2019 remarks, as prepared for delivery, can be read below: Incivility and Hyperpartisanship: Is Washington a Symptom or a Cause Senator Susan M. Collins (As prepared for delivery) \u201cThank you, President Hunter. I\u2019m honored to give the Margaret Chase Smith Lecture at a time that we celebrate the University of Maine\u2019s 150th anniversary. I know that Senator Smith would be very pleased that I was just introduced by the University\u2019s first female president \u2013 and I also know that she would be proud of the excellent job that you are doing. \u201cPeople in our State and throughout the nation have made it clear that they are fed up with the incivility and gridlock that have prevented congressional action on too many of the serious problems facing our nation. But that divisiveness and animosity raise a larger question: Is the hyperpartisanship that grips Washington a symptom or the cause of the incivility that we see throughout our society? \u201cIn asking this question, I am reminded of the response former Senator Lowell Weicker gave to an unhappy constituent. When the constituent angrily denounced Senator Weicker and his colleagues, saying \u201cyou are all a bunch of liars, thieves, and womanizers,\u201d Senator Weicker calmly replied, \u201cWell, it is, after all, a representative form of government.\u201d \u201cThe \u201csymptom or cause\u201d question may seem to be a variation on the famous \u201cchicken or the egg\u201d dilemma that has puzzled philosophers and scientists from Aristotle to Stephen Hawking. When it comes to the role of civility in all aspects of life, we do well to remember that we get a chicken by hatching the egg, not by smashing it. \u201cIt is entirely reasonable to think that the poisonous atmosphere in Washington is both part symptom and part cause. Here\u2019s one way to look at it. If you have ever been between two mirrors that face each other, such as in a barbershop, you have seen the endless line of images fading into the distance. One reflection generates another, seemingly into infinity. \u201cIn much the same way, incivility by political leaders sends a message to our society that such discourse is acceptable, while the increasing coarseness in our society is a green light to divisive politicians. Each reflects the other. One insult generates another, ad infinitum and ad nauseum. \u201cPerhaps it is time that we stop focusing on these damaging reflections and turn the mirror on ourselves. \u201cLet me begin by setting the stage, as I see it, with a discussion of the arena of discourse with which I am most familiar, the United States Senate. As our Constitution was being developed, legend tells us of a conversation between George Washington and Thomas Jefferson in which our first president applied the metaphor of the cooling saucer to the Senate. He compared the House to hot tea, which was then poured into the cooling saucer of the Senate, a metaphor reflecting the Senate\u2019s more deliberative approach. The conversation may be apocryphal, but there is no doubt that the founders of our nation recognized the need for a legislative chamber in which the heat of political passions could cool. \u201cThe Senate was designed expressly for that purpose. It is there that the interests of small states and of the minority point of view are to be protected. It is there that raw political power should give way to statesmanship. It is an ideal we have seen carried out by the great Senators of the past, like Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and Arthur Vandenberg. It is an ideal that we have embraced in Maine by sending thoughtful and respected leaders to Washington like Margaret Chase Smith, Ed Muskie, Bill Cohen, George Mitchell, and Olympia Snowe. \u201cTo be sure, that ideal is not always met. In a 1935 radio broadcast, the humorist Will Rogers examined the courtliness of the Senate and found it, at times, to be less than sincere. The polite terms of address for the opposing party \u2013 such as \u201cmy good friend from Maine\u201d or \u201cmy distinguished colleague from Oregon\u201d \u2013 were sometimes delivered with such barely concealed dislike that Rogers suggested it would have been more honest for members to address each other as \u201cthe coyote from Maine\u201d or \u201cthe polecat from Oregon.\u201d \u201cJust so nobody gets the wrong idea, I do not believe that the other Senator from Maine is a coyote, and Angus King is, in fact, \u201cmy good friend.\u201d \u201cEighty years later, there is all too often no attempt whatsoever to conceal disdain. And increasingly, those tensions appear to break down along partisan or philosophical lines. \u201cI am not endorsing phony politeness for appearances\u2019 sake. But Senate courtesies are meant to be the external evidence of the Senate\u2019s abiding culture. It is a culture that is built upon a foundation of respect and cooperation that is meant to transcend partisanship. It is a culture in which legislative goals are reached with patience, persuasion, and perseverance, not with raw power. These Senate traditions are important because they are intended to depersonalize the debate and to remind heated adversaries that when their current legislative dispute is over, they will be working again with their opponents on a different issue on which they may agree. \u201cSince I joined the Senate 18 years ago, I have witnessed a withering of this culture. Ideology and partisanship dictate far too much of our conduct. Obstructionism is too often employed for its own sake. Base motives are impugned for reasonable policy differences, allowing legitimate differences to evolve into bitter personal disputes. The cooling saucer more and more resembles an overheated skillet. \u201cI am uncertain who first described politics as the \u201cart of compromise,\u201d but that maxim, to which I have always subscribed, seems woefully out of fashion today. Sitting down with those on the opposite side of an issue, figuring out which issues matter the most to each side, negotiating in good faith, and attempting to reach a solution are actions often vilified by hard-liners on both the left and the right. Far too often, reaching across party lines \u2013 even when it produces results \u2013 is greeted with scorn by strident partisans who accuse the compromiser of being a \u201csell out.\u201d \u201cFor too many today, achieving solutions is not the primary goal; rather, it is to draw sharp distinctions and score political points, even if that means that the problems confronting our country go unresolved. That is surely one reason that Congress is held in such low esteem by the American people. \u201cHistorians would tell you that the degree of civility in Congress has ebbed and flowed over the years and would point out that at least we don\u2019t have one member caning another into unconsciousness, as happened in 1856 when a Representative from South Carolina flogged a Massachusetts Senator with a cane on the Senate floor. But in modern times, I have not seen the degree of bitter divisiveness and excessive partisanship now found in the Senate. The weapon of choice today is not a metal-topped cane, but poisonous words. \u201cSo how did we get here? What are the factors? And are these factors symptoms or causes of a broader decline in civility? It is not always easy to tell. Let me start with a familiar example. Resentments have built in the Senate due to rule changes that diminished the role of the minority party. In the Senate, which used to pride itself on being the bastion of free and open debate, procedural tactics were increasingly used to prevent minority amendments during the last Congress. That caused the minority to overuse the filibuster to stop bills to which it could not offer amendments. That, in turn, led to the majority party breaking the Senate rules to change Senate rules \u2013 no small irony there \u2013 in order to prevent the filibuster in certain circumstances. The minority, appropriately, cried \u201cfoul.\u201d An election occurred, the minority became the majority, but guess what? The new majority then changed its mind and decided that it liked these new rules after all, now that they favored their side. \u201cAnother negative development that has contributed to the decline in civility is campaigning against one\u2019s colleagues. When I was a freshman Senator in 1997, Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, as fine a gentleman as has ever graced the Senate chamber, advised me never to campaign against those with whom I served \u2013 a practice I immediately adopted. The Senate is too small a place to campaign against your colleagues, he counseled. It will poison your relationship with them and make it much harder to work together. \u201cWas he ever right. \u201cBack then, most Senators followed the \u201cChafee Rule,\u201d But that soon changed. Now many Senators enthusiastically campaign against their colleagues across the aisle. Some Members even campaign against incumbent Senators in their own caucus. \u201cI know how maddening this can be because it has happened to me. One example: when I supported reasonable background checks for gun buyers to prevent criminals and individuals with severe mental illness from buying firearms, a Republican colleague helped raise money for a far-right group that produced negative television ads in which I morphed into -- Barack Obama. \u201cBy the way, I showed the ad to the President and he was quite amused -- in fact, he said he thought my hairstyle looked good on him. \u201cThe problem is that personal attacks in campaigns have detrimental effects that last long after Election Day. Successful legislative partnerships depend on trust. It is difficult to consider someone a potential trusted legislative partner when that person has taken the extraordinary step of traveling to your home state to criticize both you and your work. \u201cThere is no shortage of party groups, special interest groups, and super PACs to do that kind of campaigning \u2013 there is no reason for Senators to be doing it to each other. \u201cThese and other bruising campaign tactics make it harder for the Senate \u2013 and the country \u2013 to transition from campaign mode to governing mode. The seemingly constant campaign cycle is aided and abetted by cable and radio shows whose ratings often depend on reaching small but highly partisan members of the electorate. Certain television shows will invite only those who will inflame the debate. Those who will suggest compromise or tone down the rhetoric won\u2019t be invited. \u201cThe tactics of the campaigns and talk shows now leak into the halls of Congress, even during formal ceremonies. Consider the House member from my party who interrupted President Obama\u2019s speech to a joint session of Congress a few years ago by yelling \"You lie!\" Or the House Democratic member whose contribution to the health care debate consisted of asserting that Republicans had a two-word plan \u2013 \u201cDie Quickly.\u201d \u201cMore recently, the letter from most my Senate Republican colleagues to the Ayatollahs in Iran was, in my view, unwise, inappropriate, and an ill-advised break from Senate tradition. It was not, however, despite the cries of some, \u201ctreasonous.\u201d There is a considerable amount of ground between a serious policy mistake and a crime that is punishable by death. \u201cWhich brings us to the other side of the equation \u2013 the role that society plays in Washington\u2019s division and dysfunction. From how we recreate, to what we think, and even to where we live, America appears to be pulling apart into factions. We are isolating ourselves from those who aren\u2019t just like ourselves. \u201cTwenty years ago, the social scientist Robert Putnam wrote an essay, later a best-selling book, titled Bowling Alone. In these works, Dr. Putnam surveyed the decline in what he termed \u201csocial capital\u201d in the United States since 1950. Using bowling as an example, he found that the recreational leagues that used to bring people from all walks of life together had all but disappeared. Where once these leagues gave the bank president and the auto mechanic, the teacher and the retiree, the opportunity to get to know one another, Americans were now bowling in solitude and isolation. \u201cThis stands in stark contrast to the observation made by the French social scientist Alexis de Tocqueville during his visit to America in the 1830s. A great strength of our young nation \u2013 especially here in New England \u2013 was the willingness of citizens, regardless of wealth, occupation, or level of education, to join in voluntary associations. From building schools to aiding the poor, shared goals were achieved. \u201cToday, polarization even shows up in where we chose to live. Through a phenomenon called \u201cresidential sorting,\u201d a Pew Research Center study finds that conservatives are consolidating in rural areas and outer suburbs, and liberals in inner suburbs and urban centers. Never mind bowling leagues; people of different political beliefs aren\u2019t even seeing one another in everyday activities. \u201cResidential sorting is exacerbated by the desire for political advantage. And this can take strange shapes \u2013 literally. \u201cCan we have the slide please? Does anyone know what this is? It is not a Rorschach test \u2013 it is the outline of a Congressional district in Pennsylvania. \u201cSo is this. You see, the district has to be contiguous. \u201cAnd this. It looks like my idea of what the Aleutian Islands look like. \u201cThe redesign of congressional districts that is necessary after every census is increasingly partisan, with each party seeking to gerrymander districts to maximum advantage. With only two districts, Maine is relatively immune. But as you can see, in many states, the boundaries of districts can be truly byzantine, with politics destroying the sense of community built by history and geography. As a consequence of packing highly partisan voters into discrete districts, moderates and independents are marginalized and their influence diminished. \u201cIt is particularly alarming that the Pew study found that a growing number of Republicans and Democrats view each other not just as the opposition party, but actually as a threat to our nation\u2019s well-being. The more politically engaged a person is, the more likely it is that he or she has adopted this apocalyptic view of people who could be neighbors, soccer coaches, and school-board members. It seems that we need to revise the old saying that familiarity breeds contempt, as the evidence mounts that unfamiliarity is the real culprit. \u201cThis tendency to live with people who think as we do is an example of Washington reflecting society, as both the Republican and Democratic caucuses have less and less to do with each other. This exacerbates the incivility problem because, as one of my colleagues observed to me recently, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to hate someone you really know.\u201d \u201cSomething as simple as sharing a meal together can help build these relationships. To that end, I co-hosted the first of what I hope are many bipartisan Senate lunches this year. \u201cI have a reputation as being someone who has a knack for putting together a bipartisan agreement. My secret is very simple \u2013 you have to understand what motivates all the parties involved. I applied that lesson to my bipartisan luncheon. In order to ensure that the event was a success, I served fresh Maine lobster prepared using my favorite University of Maine lobster salad recipe. It will come as no surprise that, despite the very busy schedule that Senators keep, we had nearly perfect attendance. I need to make one thing clear. Civility does not require us to stifle our disagreements. We still can and should vigorously debate issues and even tell unpleasant truths. Otherwise, we would be left with nothing more than polite but meaningless discourse devoid of passion and principle. The point is, there is a right way and wrong way to have these disagreements. A famous example from history illustrates the point. \u201cThe great leader we honor today provided a shining example of how a vigorous discussion of a challenging issue should be conducted \u2013 and her foil in this story is a perfect example of how such a discussion should not be conducted. \u201cWhen Senator Margaret Chase Smith went to the Senate floor on June 1, 1950, to deliver her famous \u201cDeclaration of Conscience,\u201d she did so not to demonize Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy as a person \u2013 as tempting as that probably was \u2013 but instead to denounce his actions. She certainly gave him great offense, but she spoke the truth about his tactics of ruining reputations, crushing free speech, and smearing his opponents. \u201cJust as important, when she condemned the accusations of \u201ccommunist\u201d and \u201cfascist\u201d that were flying about the Senate chamber, she was addressing both sides of the aisle. It was an incredibly bold move that resonated with the American people and helped to bring the Senate back to its senses. Americans again felt the touch of what President Lincoln used to refer to as \u201cthe better angels of our nature.\u201d \u201cContrast that with the infamous speech Senator McCarthy gave four months earlier in Wheeling, West Virginia. His opening remarks that February day were intended to honor Abraham Lincoln\u2019s birthday, but Senator McCarthy had clearly evaded his better angels. His speech was a tirade of accusation, fear-mongering, and name-calling. That speech was not corrective, but merely destructive. \u201cHistory has judged these two approaches and declared a clear winner. Today, Senator Smith is revered as a model of leadership who left a remarkable record of accomplishment. Senator McCarthy is but a sad chapter in our history who left only a scar. \u201cLet me now turn to the role that the Internet plays in this whole discussion. The Internet has the potential to bring people together by making new information and different points of view available to all. Ironically, it all too often has the opposite effect. Studies by the Pew Research Center have found that the Internet is displacing face-to-face contact and that Websites devoted to political and social issues increasingly are tending to the extremes, where alternate views are either ignored or misrepresented and ridiculed. \u201cThe divisiveness of social media is fostered by the prevalence of anonymous commenters who are shielded from any repercussions to their ugly and false statements. Personally, I have never understood why anyone would care what \u201cmaddog38\u201d and \u201chippiegal\u201d think about an issue, but that is the trend. \u201cWe have all seen routinely how seemingly mundane discussions deteriorate into online food fights. A fairly innocuous op-ed I submitted to a Maine newspaper last month illustrates the now-familiar pattern. I was explaining my view that federal agencies have an obligation to use the most current and accurate scientific information in their decisions, and that members of Congress have an obligation to provide oversight to ensure that was done. This was not exactly the type of article that would capture the imagination or inflame the American public. \u201cMy piece generated 48 reader comments. All but four were anonymous. The very first comment accused Republicans of being greedy; the second called Democrats stupid. That was basically the high point of the discussion \u2013 it went downhill from there. Very few of the comments had anything to do with the subject of the article I wrote. \u201cThe harsh, anonymous comments appended to news articles are harbingers of the much more dangerous online phenomenon of cyberbullying. This is an enormous problem, and it is growing worse. We have all heard the heartbreaking stories of young girls and boys who have committed suicide due to relentless and cruel on-line taunting. \u201cBullying in politics has become increasingly common as well. And, in addition to harming the workings of our government and discouraging good people from getting involved, it can have tragic personal consequences as well. \u201cWe saw this one month ago in Missouri. Tom Schweich was the popular and effective State Auditor. Previously, he served as the lead investigator into the Waco siege, as chief of staff to our Ambassador to the United Nations, and as head of our counternarcotics initiatives in Afghanistan. Early this year, he announced that he was running for governor of Missouri. \u201cWhat happened next to Tom Schweich defines the term \u201cthe politics of personal destruction.\u201d First, he was attacked by an anonymously funded radio ad that, among other things, mocked his slight physical stature and called him \u201ca little bug\u201d that should be squashed. Then, a whispering campaign began that he was Jewish, a clear appeal to the world\u2019s oldest bigotry, anti-Semitism. On February 26, Tom Schweich took his own life. \u201cThe eulogy at Mr. Schweich\u2019s funeral early this month was delivered by John Danforth, a former Missouri Senator. Senator Danforth\u2019s words were filled with admiration for his friend and of heartfelt condolence to Mr. Schweich\u2019s wife and children. \u201cBut his remarks also were a powerful indictment of what politics has become. To be sure, he said, politics has always been combative, but this wasn\u2019t combat; it was character assassination. To those who said Mr. Schweich should have been less sensitive, that he should have been tougher and able to take the attacks in stride, Senator Danforth answered that such a view blames the victim and \u201ccreates a new normal, where politics is only for the tough, and the crude, and the calloused.\u201d \u201cFrom the pulpit, Senator Danforth asked this crucial question: \u201cIf this is what politics has become, what decent person would want to get into it?\u201d And he posed this challenge, not just to the mourners, but to every American: \u201cIt\u2019s now our duty, yours and mine, to turn politics into something much better than its now so miserable state.\u201d \u201cWhether Washington leads the nation in incivility or merely reflects our society, we each can play an important role in elevating the level of discourse in our own homes, schools, and communities. \u201cIn Washington, we who represent the people of this great nation must put progress over partisanship, statesmanship over stridency, and compromise over conflict. That would produce a very different legislative climate, one in which the objective is to solve the problem, not just to score political points. \u201cIf I am correct that a return to civility and a spirit of compromise must be driven by concerned citizens, then you will have to lead the way. That means working in your community for a renewed social climate characterized by civility and respect for differing viewpoints. \u201cThe challenge we face today was recognized by Senator Margaret Chase Smith in her \u201cDeclaration of Conscience\u201d 65 years ago. While she avidly supported her party, she did not want to it ride to political victory with the \u201cFour Horsemen of Calumny \u2013 Fear, Ignorance, Bigotry, and Smear.\u201d Let us put those four out to pasture, and saddle up the one called \u201cCivility.\u201d We might be surprised at how far it will take us.\""},
{"title": "Restoring Civility In Washington And In Our Communities", "date": ["Posted Mon, 04/06/2015 - 10:43"], "release": "People in Maine and throughout the nation have made it clear that they are fed up with the incivility and gridlock that have prevented congressional action on too many of the serious problems facing our nation. But that divisiveness and animosity raise a larger question: Is the hyperpartisanship that grips Washington a symptom or the cause of the incivility that we see throughout our society? I recently addressed this issue in the Margaret Chase Smith Lecture at the University of Maine. It is my hope that these thoughts will help spark much-needed reflection among both political leaders and the citizens who elect them. It is entirely reasonable to think that the poisonous atmosphere in Washington is both part symptom and part cause. Incivility by political leaders sends a message to our society that such discourse is acceptable, while the increasing coarseness in our society is a green light to divisive politicians. Each reflects the other. Today, the art of compromise seems woefully out of fashion. Since I joined the Senate 18 years ago, I have witnessed a withering of statesmanship in Washington. Far too often, reaching across party lines \u2013 even when it produces results \u2013 is greeted with scorn by strident partisans who accuse the compromiser of being a \u201csell out.\u201d Bruising campaign tactics make it harder for the Senate \u2013 and the country \u2013 to transition from campaign mode to governing mode. The seemingly constant campaign cycle is aided and abetted by cable and radio shows whose ratings often depend on reaching small but highly partisan members of the electorate. Certain television shows will invite only those who will inflame the debate. Those who will suggest compromise or tone down the rhetoric won\u2019t be invited. On the other side of the equation is the role that society plays in Washington\u2019s division and dysfunction. From how we recreate, to what we think, and even to where we live, America appears to be pulling apart into factions. We are isolating ourselves from those who aren\u2019t just like ourselves.

A verifiable diplomatic agreement that prevents Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and dismantles its nuclear infrastructure remains the desired outcome, but it's not clear that the proposed framework will accomplish that goal. \"First, the framework appears to delay, rather than eliminate, Iran's path toward becoming a nuclear weapon state. It apparently would allow Iran to retain troubling capabilities that constitute a threshold nuclear weapon state. \"In addition, existing UN Security Council resolutions require Iran to address questions about the possible military dimensions of its nuclear program. Rather than resolving these questions in the framework, they remain unsettled, as they have been for many years. \"I hope President Obama will seek Senate review and a vote on this agreement.

{"title": "U.S. Senator Susan Collins Delivers Distinguished Lecture At Colby College", "date": ["Posted Fri, 04/10/2015 - 09:41"], "release": "Waterville, ME \u2013 U.S. Senator Susan Collins delivered the 2015 Senator George J. Mitchell International Lecture at Colby College this evening. Senator Collins\u2019 address was titled, \u201cBipartisanship and Moderation: The Formula for Progress\u201d and discussed one of her highest priorities in the U.S. Senate: facilitating strong bipartisan compromise to achieve progress. First elected in 1996, Senator Collins has earned a national reputation as an effective legislator who works across party lines to seek consensus on our nation\u2019s most important issues. Since 2005, the Senator George J. Mitchell Distinguished International Lecture Series has brought a prominent foreign policy leaders to Colby College for a lecture and a dinner. Past speakers have included the Honorable Madeline Albright and former U.S. Senator Thomas A. Daschle. Senator Collins received an honorary degree from Colby College at the inauguration of the College\u2019s 20th president, David A. Greene, in September of 2014. See below and  for a full copy of Senator Collins\u2019 remarks, as prepared for delivery: Sen. Susan M. Collins April 9, 2015 Bipartisanship and Moderation: The Formula for Progress Thank you, Senator Mitchell. I am honored to have you here tonight. From Waterville to Washington and from Northern Ireland to the Middle East, Senator Mitchell has created a legacy of accomplishment and service. Our nation and the world are grateful for his dedication. Even as he has built a remarkable national and international reputation, George Mitchell has never forgotten where he came from. His love of Maine always shines brightly. I am honored to be here again at Colby College. Last year, Colby awarded me an honorary degree, which meant so much to me. It was exactly 100 years after my great-aunt, Clara Collins Piper, received her Colby degree. What a remarkable woman she was. She first attended Colby as a 17 year-old girl in 1909, but then ran out of money and had to leave in 1911 to teach school to earn enough to complete her degree, which she did in 1914. How unusual that must have been in those days -- particularly for a young woman -- to want an education that much! The journey from Capitol Hill to Mayflower Hill is one I always enjoy, particularly when my destination is the Goldfarb Center for Public Affairs and Civic Engagement. Before I begin, let me say that I am aware that last month\u2019s lecture was on the longstanding tradition of satire and mockery in American politics \u2013 particularly directed at those in political office. I am just hoping that those of you who attended that event saw it as a fascinating history lesson and not as an instruction manual. At least not for tonight. My topic this evening is why moderation and bipartisanship lead to progress. The flip side of that premise, of course, is how the hyperpartisanship and incivility in Washington and throughout our nation elevate extremism and prevent progress. If you feel like you are living in one of the most partisan times in modern American history, there is a reason for that \u2013 you are. I make this statement based on an analysis of party unity voting in Congress recently published by the well-known Washington news magazine CQ Weekly \u2013 a publication that covers Congress in a decidedly non-partisan manner. Because we have the good fortune to have this lecture\u2019s namesake here tonight, let\u2019s look at the percentage of \u201cparty unity\u201d votes that occurred in the Senate when George Mitchell was Majority Leader. By party unity votes, I am referring to the percentage of Senate votes where the majority of Republicans vote one way and the majority of Democrats vote the other. During Senator Mitchell\u2019s six-year tenure as Leader, with one exception, the percentage of party unity votes hovered around 50 percent each year. In fact, in Senator Mitchell\u2019s first year as Leader, the percentage of party unity votes was only 35 percent. In contrast, last year, it was 67 percent. This was actually an improvement over two years ago, when it was 70 percent. Another way to look at this is by considering the votes of individual Senators to see how often each votes with his or her own party \u2013 whether the votes are controversial or not. Last year, all but three of my Republican colleagues voted with their caucus on more than 80 percent of all votes cast. By the way, Lisa Murkowski, Kelly Ayotte, and I were the three Senators. The discerning individuals in this hall will notice what these less-partisan Senators have in common. On the other side of the aisle, only one Democrat voted with his party fewer than 93 percent of the time. In fact, eight Democrats voted with their party 99.5 percent of the time \u2013 and 11 Democrats did so on 100 percent of all votes cast last year. I support the two-party system, and I am not trying to imply that over the previous half-century everyone got along all the time. But, like most Americans, I have never believed that either party has a monopoly on good ideas. The strength of the Senate is that it is the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body \u2013 where proposals are intended to be considered from all possible points of view, debated \u2013 even argued about \u2013 and then eventually advanced or rejected through negotiation and compromise. But, as you can see, the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body didn\u2019t do much deliberating last year. I have my own theories about what causes the hyperpartisanship that we see in politics today -- and the great thing about being a Senator is that I can set forth my ideas tonight without the years of painstaking research and mountains of documentary evidence that the scholars in the audience need to produce to support their theories. While there are myriad causes, I will highlight four interconnected factors that contribute to the problem. First is the general lowering of the level of discourse that we have seen in the Internet Age, as media such as Twitter and anonymous online comments have emerged as the preferred arena for political debate. Studies by the Pew Research Center have found that the Internet is rapidly displacing face-to-face contact and that Websites devoted to political and social issues increasingly are tending to the extremes, where alternate views are either ignored or misrepresented and ridiculed. In short, people tend to congregate online with people who think as they do. When they encounter opposing viewpoints, the trend is to attack, rather than debate. We have all seen routinely how seemingly mundane discussions deteriorate into online food fights. And while I have never understood why anyone would care what \u201cChickadee 38\u201d and \u201cForest Grump\u201d think about an issue, these anonymous posts can certainly get a reaction. A fairly innocuous op-ed I submitted to a Maine newspaper last month illustrates the now-familiar pattern. I was explaining my view that federal agencies have an obligation to use the most current scientific information in their decisions, and that members of Congress have an obligation to provide oversight to ensure that is done. This was not exactly the type of article that would capture the imagination or inflame the American public. My piece generated 48 reader comments. All but four were anonymous. The very first comment accused Republicans of being \u201cgreedy\u201d; the second called Democrats \u201cstupid.\u201d That was basically the high point of the discussion \u2013 it went downhill from there. Very few of the comments had anything to do with the subject of the article I wrote. A second factor is a close cousin to the bruising Internet chatter \u2013 that is, the cable and radio shows whose ratings depend on reaching small but highly partisan members of the electorate. Certain television shows will invite only those who will inflame the debate. Those who will suggest compromise or tone down the rhetoric won\u2019t be invited. The tone of these discussions has leaked into the halls of Congress, even during formal ceremonies. Consider the House member from my party who interrupted President Obama\u2019s speech to a joint session of Congress a few years ago by yelling \"You lie!\" Or the House Democratic member whose contribution to the health care debate consisted of asserting that Republicans had a two-word plan \u2013 \u201cDie Quickly.\u201d A third related factor is that we live in a time of never-ending campaign cycles. When I started in the Senate, some in Washington would cynically refer to odd-numbered years in Congress as \u201cwork years\u201d and even-numbered years as \u201ccampaign years.\u201d If only we could keep to that schedule now, it would actually be an improvement. And speaking of campaigns -- can we have the slide please? Does anyone know what this is? It is not a Rorschach test \u2013 it is the outline of a Congressional district in Pennsylvania. So is this. You see, the district has to be contiguous. And this. It looks like my idea of what the Aleutian Islands look like. As you might suspect, gerrymandering of Congressional districts is the fourth factor. Gerrymandering is an old concept, but it is being elevated to an art form to create one-party Congressional districts. With only two districts, Maine is relatively immune. But in many states the boundaries of districts can be truly byzantine, where the sense of community built by history and geography is giving way to the desire to create so-called \u201cRed\u201d or \u201cBlue\u201d districts, perpetually safe from electoral challenge. In a primary election, candidates from the extremes of the political spectrum tend to have an advantage. The check on this is that in the general election, the victorious candidate is often the one who can win the votes of the center. So in a balanced district, you have an imperfect but relatively effective equilibrium where the system incentivizes primary voters to select candidates with broader appeal. This incentivizes candidates to take more reasonable positions. In unbalanced gerrymandered districts, however, that equation gets turned on its head. The primary winner in an overwhelmingly Red or Blue district is the odds-on favorite to win the general election. In these districts, independents and moderates are marginalized. As a result, the districts produce more Members of Congress from the extremes. When you combine these four factors, it gets harder and harder to convince people to work together. I am uncertain who first described politics as the \u201cart of compromise,\u201d but that maxim, to which I have always subscribed, seems woefully out of fashion today. Sitting down with those on the opposite side of an issue, figuring out which issues matter the most to each side, negotiating in good faith, and attempting to reach a solution are actions often vilified by hard-liners on both the left and the right. Far too often, reaching across party lines \u2013 even when it produces results \u2013 is greeted with scorn by strident partisans who accuse the compromiser of being a \u201csellout.\u201d For too many today, achieving solutions is not the primary goal; rather, it is to score political points, even if that means that the problems confronting our country go unresolved. That is surely one reason that Congress is held in such low esteem by the American people. As the title of my talk indicates, I firmly believe that bipartisanship and compromise lead not only to action but also to better results. And I also believe that the converse is true. Partisanship and intransigence lead to worse results. When we act unilaterally, we tend to either make bad decisions or spiral into dysfunction \u2013 or both. A recent example involves Senate rule changes surrounding the filibuster. In the Senate, procedural tactics were increasingly used to prevent minority amendments during the last Congress. That caused the minority to overuse the filibuster to stop bills to which it could not offer amendments. That, in turn, led to the majority party breaking the Senate rules to change Senate rules \u2013 no small irony there \u2013 in order to prevent the filibuster in certain circumstances. The minority, appropriately, cried \u201cfoul.\u201d An election occurred, the minority became the majority, but guess what? The new majority then changed its mind and decided that it liked these new rules after all, now that they favored their side. It doesn\u2019t have to be like this. Many of the great accomplishments that we have had in Congress have been the product of bipartisan efforts. An historic example that is fresh in my mind is the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Last month, I had the good fortune to attend 50th Anniversary celebration in Selma, Alabama, of the passage of this historic law. Our delegation included Senator Tim Scott, the first African-American Senator elected from the South since 1881, and the great civil rights icon, John Lewis, who is now a Congressman from Georgia. We commemorated the march for voting rights across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, the scene of the infamous \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d attack on March 7, 1965. Just as an aside, I have to tell you how moving Congressman Lewis\u2019s remarks were at the ceremony. He demonstrates an amazing capacity for forgiveness. There was not a trace of bitterness in his retelling of the repeated beatings and jailings he endured as he fought for justice and equality as the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. At the ceremony, Congressman Lewis stood near Peggy Wallace Kennedy, daughter of Governor George Wallace who ordered the state troopers to assault the peaceful marchers. How wonderful that she was present, too. The powerful themes of redemption and forgiveness resonated throughout the weekend. The Voting Rights Act was dependent on a bipartisan effort in Congress. Senator Mike Mansfield, the Democratic Leader, and Senator Everett Dirksen, the Republican Leader, wrote the bill together in close consultation with President Johnson. Senators Mansfield and Dirksen worked together to overcome the many obstacles the bill faced getting through Congress: fighting back delays in Committee, rounding up votes to overcome amendments and filibusters that would kill the bill, and strategizing how to get the bill through conference. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 79-18, with just one Republican voting in opposition along with 17 Democrats. In Selma, Luci Baines Johnson told me a story of her father, President Johnson, signing this historic law. As a teenager, watching her father at the bill signing ceremony, she saw him give the first signing pen to Senator Dirksen. \u201cDaddy,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhy did you give that pen to that grumpy old Republican?\u201d \u201cBecause, Luci Baines,\u201d he replied, \u201cwithout the Republicans, that would have been just a bill, not a law.\u201d There is a reason why President Johnson\u2019s biographer, Robert Caro, described him as the \u201cMaster of the Senate.\u201d Let me further illustrate the power of bipartisanship with the story of the repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask/Don\u2019t Tell.\u201d In 2010, I joined Senator Joe Lieberman in leading the fight to repeal this law that prevented patriotic gay and lesbian Americans from serving in the armed forces unless they concealed their sexual orientation. My view was that we ought to be expressing our gratitude to those willing to serve, not drumming them out of our armed forces. Keep in mind that Don\u2019t Ask/Don\u2019t Tell was signed into law by a Democratic President, Bill Clinton, in 1993 and enjoyed bipartisan support for many years. Its successful repeal was going to require Republican as well as Democratic votes. As difficult as it may be to imagine now, in 2010 outright repeal was still controversial. For example, while the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified in favor of repeal, the Commandant of the Marine Corps was strongly opposed to repealing this 17-year-old discriminatory law. In March of 2010, during consideration of the huge defense policy bill by the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Joe Lieberman, an Independent, the Chairman Carl Levin, a Democrat, and I, a Republican, pressed the case for repeal. Two Democrats on the Committee, one with extensive military experience, argued against repeal, as did former POW and Republican presidential candidate John McCain. After a contentious debate, the Committee voted 16 to 13 to include repeal in the defense bill \u2013 not exactly an overwhelming vote. Nevertheless, this was a significant first step, even though at the time I was the only Republican to vote in favor of repeal. But I was optimistic that, ultimately, I could convince others to join me. In December, during the final days of the legislative session, the giant defense bill, which included the repeal provisions, was brought up on the Senate floor. But dysfunction in the Senate and disagreement over amendments stalled the defense bill and almost killed repeal of DA/DT. We appeared to be stymied. Senator Lieberman and I talked about how to respond to this big setback. We decided to introduce a separate bipartisan bill to repeal DA/DT. But the clock was ticking, and we were worried about how we would get our bill brought to the Senate floor. That weekend, the Assistant Democratic Leader from the House, Steny Hoyer, called me. He proposed that the House, then under Democratic control, would pass a separate repeal bill but wanted a guarantee from Joe and me that we could round up a sufficient number of Republican votes to pass it in the Senate. I told him that I thought we could. For the next 10 days, Senator Lieberman and I worked night and day to round up Republican votes even as the clock on the 111th Congress ran down. Many people thought ours was an impossible task, but we made the case persistently, one-on-one with our colleagues. When the Senate clerk began to call the roll on our bill, I was anxious but confident that the Republican votes needed to put the bill over the top were there. And they were. The final roll call on December 20th was a filibuster-proof 65 to 31, and history was made when the bill was signed into law two days later. My point is, that as with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, without bipartisan leaders, and without the votes of members of both parties, DA/DT would not have been repealed that year. And because there was bipartisan support, there has not been any serious attempt to delay or turn back the clock on repeal. The government shutdown a year and a half ago provides another clear example of the damage caused by ideological polarization, and its resolution once again demonstrates the power of bipartisan compromise. The shutdown started on October 1, 2013, because Congress and the Administration failed to reach an agreement to fund the federal government for the new fiscal year that began on that date. It is estimated that the 16-day shutdown cost the American economy $24 billion. Hard-working people in Maine paid a high price for Washington\u2019s hyperpartisanship. Small businesses \u2013 such as the inns, gift shops, and restaurants -- around Acadia National Park lost some $16 million, or $1 million each day, due to the closure of the park during the peak fall foliage season. That hurt not just the business owners but also the wait staff, store clerks, and housekeepers. On Saturday, October 5, as the shutdown ended its first week, I was alone in my Senate office listening to the highly partisan debate in the Senate. All of my staff was furloughed. The debate on the Senate floor consisted of a Democratic Senator followed by a Republican Senator, alternating back and forth, each blaming the other side with no one offering a solution. I thought, \u201cThis must stop.\u201d I drafted a plan I believed both parties could live with, rushed over to the Senate floor, and implored my colleagues to work to end the impasse. I said it was time both sides came out of their partisan corners, stopped fighting, and started legislating in a manner worthy of the people of this great nation. No sooner did I leave the Senate floor than my cellphone started ringing. First to call was Lisa Murkowski from Alaska who said, \u201cCount me in; I want to help.\u201d The next call was from Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire with much the same message. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also called. The discerning in the room will once again recognize the same pattern I alluded to earlier\u2026 We also attracted a few good men, I hasten to say. Very quickly, I was leading a bipartisan group of seven Republicans, six Democrats, and one Independent, my Maine colleague Angus King. We worked night and day to come up with a compromise to reopen government. Reaching across party lines, we broke through the partisan impasse. Instead of finger-pointing and blame-fixing, we offered a solution. It showed that the two parties could come together, negotiate, and reach an agreement in an atmosphere of mutual respect and good faith. I call our bipartisan group the \u201cCommon Sense Coalition,\u201d and we continue to seek solutions across the partisan divide. Compromise is difficult, but governing without it in a democracy is impossible. Rather than second best, a bipartisan solution reached by honest debate and consideration of alternate viewpoints very often is not just the one with the best chance to prevail, but also the best answer. Often, what makes a policy issue challenging is that there are valid arguments and concerns on both sides. In such cases, the optimal resolution accommodates the concerns of the opposing sides to the greatest extent possible. For many of the issues we address in Washington are not about fundamentals, about right versus wrong. The vast majority of policy decisions \u2013 whether on tax policy, spending priorities, environmental decisions, or a host of other subjects \u2013 require a careful and informed balancing of different points of view. In short, they require compromise. There is no magic bullet. Washington is unlikely to change unless those outside of Washington demand it. We who represent the people of this great nation must put progress over partisanship, statesmanship over stridency, and compromise over conflict. I hope that the examples I have provided will underscore this crucial point: unyielding adherence to an extreme position is easy. It is compromise, the hard work of bringing people together to find common ground that requires determination, intellect, and courage. It may not be easy to be passionate about compromise, but it is easy to be passionate about justice, opportunity, and progress. Thank you, and I am happy to take your questions."},
{"title": "Senator Susan Collins Gives Keynote Address To 10th Annual Geriatric Day Conference In Portland", "date": ["Posted Fri, 04/10/2015 - 10:10"], "release": "Portland, ME \u2013 Senator Susan Collins, who is Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, gave the keynote address at the 10th Annual Geriatrics Day Conference today at the Maine Medical Center in Portland. Senator Collins\u2019 address updated the Conference on her leadership of the Aging Committee and her work to address the increasing challenges facing older Americans throughout Maine and across our country. At the request of Senator Collins, Dr. Heidi Wierman, Division Director of Geriatrics at the Maine Medical Center recently testified at a Senate Aging Committee hearing to discuss Alzheimer\u2019s disease and its toll on our nation. The full text of Senator Collins\u2019 remarks, as prepared for delivery, can be read  and below: Geriatrics Day Conference Remarks of Senator Susan Collins April 8, 2015 Thank you, Dr. Wierman, for that very kind introduction. I also want to thank you again for appearing as a witness before the Senate Special Committee on Aging during the recent hearing I called to examine our nation\u2019s fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Your service as a geriatric physician is so crucial to our state, and your insight into caring for patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia, are truly invaluable. Each one of you is keenly aware that the number of Americans over the age of 65 is projected to double from 40.2 million in 2010 to more than 88.5 million in 2050. And the number of people over age 85 will nearly quadruple in that same period, increasing from 5.8 million to 19 million. With Maine being the oldest state in the nation by median age, your professions could not be more critical to our aging nation. The fact that this is often a sold-out conference with a waiting list for those who wish to attend, illustrates the importance of the issues you are addressing today. Maine\u2019s population of older individuals, the rapidly changing demographics of our nation, and the challenges that result from these changes are among the reasons why I pursued a leadership position on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, a Committee on which I have served since 1997. Throughout its history, this committee has spurred Congress to action on issues important to older Americans through its hearings, investigations, and reports. I appreciate this opportunity to update you on my work on the Aging Committee. Some of you may know Barbara Smith, also known as \u201cB.\u201d, as a former supermodel who has graced the cover of fashion magazines. She was a restauranteur, author, and radio and television host. In her own words, she now has the \u201cmost important job of all,\u201d which is to make a difference in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Through very moving and emotional testimony, Ms. Smith recently described her struggles with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s at a hearing before the Senate Aging Committee. Right by her side, literally and figuratively, is her husband Dan Gasby, who says this cruel disease has taken away a person who was at the peak of her abilities. During this hearing, we asked this question: \u201cIs our nation on track to finding a treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease by 2025?\u201d This is the goal called for in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, as well as by many experts. As I presided over the hearing, I looked onto a standing-room-only hearing room that was filled with hundreds of Alzheimer\u2019s advocates from throughout the nation, including many from Maine, who wore the color purple to symbolize their support for finding a cure. This \u201csea of purple\u201d served as another stark reminder that five million Americans suffer from a disease for which there is no cure, no effective treatments, and no means of prevention. In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer\u2019s costs the United States more than $226 billion a year, including $153 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid. These costs will skyrocket as the baby boom generation ages. Already our nation\u2019s most expensive disease, Alzheimer\u2019s is projected to cost more than $1.1 trillion in 2050 if nothing is done to change its current trajectory. It is now estimated that nearly one in two baby boomers reaching 85 will develop Alzheimer\u2019s. As a consequence, chances are that members of the baby boom generation will either be spending their golden years with Alzheimer\u2019s or caring for someone who has it. It is imperative that we dramatically increase our investment in Alzheimer\u2019s research. Take a look at this chart on the screen behind me. At a time when the United States is spending $226 billion a year to care for Alzheimer\u2019s patients, we are spending less than three tenths of one percent of that amount less than $600 million a year on research. You can barely see the expenditure on the chart. Alzheimer\u2019s receives funding that is clearly disproportionately low compared to its human and economic toll. We currently spend $5.4 billion a year for cancer research, $3 billion a year for research on HIV/AIDS, and $2 billion for cardiovascular research, all investments that have paid dividends. These investments in research for other diseases have yielded tremendous results: patients have access to new treatments, and death rates for some diseases are decreasing. Yet, at the same time, mortality due to Alzheimer\u2019s is escalating dramatically. Surely we can do more for Alzheimer\u2019s given its tremendous human and economic price. Fortunately, there is promising research that holds hope for Alzheimer\u2019s patients and their families. The research community is poised to make important advances through clinical trials and investigating new therapeutic targets. I recently had the opportunity to visit the Memory Disorders Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital to learn about exciting research being conducted at this facility. Advancements in imaging, for example, hold great promise for more effective and early diagnosis. During our recent hearing, we also heard from Dr. Ron Petersen, Director of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center. He described encouraging advancements in the effort to better identify so-called \u201cbiomarkers\u201d that indicate development of the disease. Identifying the disease as early as possible could help prevent further damage from being done to a patient\u2019s brain. These research developments hold great promise, but require significantly more funding. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer\u2019s is a result of legislation I authored with former Senator Evan Bayh. The plan calls for prevention and an effective treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease by 2025. To meet that goal, the Chairman of the federal Alzheimer\u2019s Advisory Council says we need to devote $2 billion a year to Alzheimer\u2019s research. Increasing our nation\u2019s investment in Alzheimer\u2019s research to just one percent of what we are currently spending on Alzheimer\u2019s would lead to better treatments and ultimately a means of prevention or a cure for this awful and expensive disease. Among my highest priorities as Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee is to ensure that the goals set forth in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer\u2019s disease are achieved. That is why I recently authored a bipartisan amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution that calls for an increase in our federal investment in Alzheimer\u2019s research. I have also been joined by my colleague, Senator Amy Klobuchar, in introducing a resolution declaring that that the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer\u2019s by 2025 is an \u201curgent national priority.\u201d Our resolution calls on the Senate to double the amount of funding the United States spends on Alzheimer\u2019s in fiscal year 2016 and develop a plan to meet the target of $2 billion. According to Alzheimer\u2019s Association, if the federal government were to invest this amount, it would recoup its investment within the first three years a treatment or means of prevention becomes available. The color purple currently represents support for Alzheimer\u2019s research, the patients and their families. I hope that someday the color purple will be worn by Alzheimer\u2019s survivors. Another disease that I know takes a tremendous toll on far too many of your older patients is diabetes. As the co-chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have learned a great deal about this terrible disease that affects 29 million Americans. It also has a cost to our nation of $174 billion as well as one out of three Medicare dollars. Fortunately, we have seen some encouraging breakthroughs and are on the threshold of a number of important new discoveries. This is particularly true for the estimated 1.2 million Americans living with type 1 diabetes. Advances in technology, like continuous glucose monitors, are helping patients control their blood glucose levels, which is key to preventing costly and sometimes deadly diabetes complications. We are also moving closer and closer to our goal of an artificial pancreas, which would control blood glucose levels automatically and revolutionize diabetes care. The NIH and FDA have been extremely supportive of these innovations in diabetes care. I was therefore surprised and troubled to learn that insulin-dependent Medicare beneficiaries are being denied coverage for continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, because CMS has determined that they do not meet the Medicare definition of durable medical equipment and do not fall under any other Medicare category. As a consequence, we are seeing situations similar to what we saw with insulin pumps in the late 1990s B where individuals with type 1 diabetes have had coverage for their continuous glucose monitor on their private insurance, only to lose it when they age into Medicare. CGM are an effective, and in some cases, life-saving way to help manage Type I diabetes. It is no wonder that about 95 percent of commercial insurers provide coverage for CGM devices. The ironic thing is that it is only because of advances in diabetes care like the continuous glucose monitor that people with type 1 diabetes can expect to live long enough to become Medicare beneficiaries. I recently joined my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, in introducing the Medicare CGM Access Act of 2014 to create a separate benefit category under Medicare for the continuous glucose monitor and to require coverage of the device for individuals meeting certain medical criteria. It simply makes no sense that Medicare does not provide coverage for CGMs, and I am working to change this policy. Finally, I want to touch on issues affecting home care and hospice. I need not tell any of you that the challenges facing our nation\u2019s health care system are driven by demographics. Our health care system now stands directly in the path of a tidal wave of aging baby boomers who will be retiring at the rate of 10,000 a day for the next 20 years. That system will clearly have to adapt and change if it is to survive the impact. One of the most important things we can do is to shift our orientation from institutional to community and home-based care. Advances in technology and medical practice have made it possible for older adults who previously would have been forced to move to a hospital or nursing home to stay just where they want to be, in the comfort, privacy and security of their own homes. Yet, Medicare beneficiaries continue to face unnecessary barriers in getting home health services. To ensure that our Medicare patients get the home care they need, when they need it, I have introduced the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act to allow advance practice nurses and physician assistants to order home health care for their Medicare patients. These health care professionals are playing increasingly important roles in the delivery of health care services, particularly in rural and medically underserved areas of our country where physicians are in short supply. Medicare already pays them to provide physician services that are within their scope of practice. They can also certify that a Medicare patient is eligible for skilled nursing services. Nurses and health care practitioners should be able order less costly home health services for their patients. I have also introduced legislation to extend the modest increase in payments for home health services in rural areas that otherwise will expire on January 1 of next year. The delivery of home health services in rural areas can be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly because of the extra travel time required to cover long distances between patients, higher transportation expenses, and other factors. If this rural payment is not extended, agencies may be forced to make decisions not to accept rural patients with greater care needs. I recently had the opportunity to participate in a National Action Conference on End-of-Life Care, hosted by the Institute of Medicine. This can be a difficult topic for many families to address. Too many Americans fail to plan for their inevitable demise, and, as a result, their care may not be what they would have chosen. Working with former Senator Jay Rockefeller, I authored the law to include a discussion regarding advance care planning during the initial \u201cWelcome to Medicare\u201d physician visit to which all Medicare beneficiaries are entitled. We must do more, however, to encourage families to have these important discussions, difficult as they may be. The changing demographics of our nation will affect every facet of our society. But at the heart of it all is the work that all of you do day in and day out. Thank you again for inviting me to speak today. I would be happy to now answer some of your questions."},
{"title": "ICYMI: \u201cCollins: Compromise Key To Progress\u201d", "date": ["Posted Mon, 04/13/2015 - 17:09"], "release": "Click   or see below to read the full story: Collins: compromise key to progress Maine\u2019s senior senator delovers Mitchell lecture Morning Sentinel By: Kaitlin Schroeder April 9, 2015 Maine's senior senator focused on the need for moderation and compromise to achieve progress in Washington. It takes moderation and bipartisanship to achieve progress in national government, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said Thursday night at a lecture at Colby College. \u201cThe flip side of that premise, of course, is how the hyperpartisanship and incivility in Washington and throughout our nation elevate extremism and prevent progress,\u201d said Collins. The Republican senator\u2019s remarks came on the heels of her recent decision to join with six other Republican senators and to decline to side with the rest of the party in sending a letter to the Iranian government attempting to undermine nuclear talks with the White House. \u201cI decided not to sign that letter because I thought it was completely inappropriate. I did not think as a senator that I should be writing to the ayatollah in Iran when the president was engaged in very sensitive negotiations,\u201d she said during a question and answer session following the talk. Collins, known for her moderate approach to politics, was speaking Thursday as the special guest and speaker at the 2015 George J. Mitchell International Lecture Series at Colby College. Each year a prominent policy leader is invited to speak at the lecture series, which honors Mitchell, a Waterville native and former U.S. Senate majority leader remembered as a mediator and peacemaker. Mitchell, in his introduction of Collins, said she represented a pragmatic kind of politics that he called \u201csomething that our country is sorely in need of.\u201d Collins pointed out that in Mitchell\u2019s first year as majority leader \u2014 1989 \u2014 the U.S. Senate voted along party lines 35 percent of the time, whereas last year it was 67 percent of the time. She said that last year, all but one Democrat voted with their party 93 percent of the time or more, and all but three Republicans voted with their caucus on more than 80 percent of all votes cast. \u201cBy the way, Lisa Murkowski, Kelly Ayotte and I were the three senators. The discerning individuals in this hall will notice what these less partisan senators have in common,\u201d she said. Collins blamed the increasingly partisan environment of the Internet for replacing face-to-face communication and lowering the level of discourse, cable and radio shows that \u201cwill invite only those who will inflame the debate,\u201d never-ending campaign cycles and gerrymandered one-party congressional districts. \u201cWhen you combine these four factors, it gets harder and harder to convince people to work together,\u201d she said. The senator highlighted examples of past bipartisan resolutions, such as the repeal of Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell in the military. She said the 1993 law banning lesbians and gays from openly serving in the military was passed with support from both sides of the aisle, and it needed bipartisan support to repeal it. She said it took Republicans and Democrats working together to reach the filibuster-proof vote of 65 to 31 to repeal. Collins also cited the successful end of the government shutdown in 2013 as a time when the two parties worked together to move forward. She said the majority of policy decisions include the informed balancing of different points of view. \u201cIn short, they require compromise,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no magic bullet. Washington is unlikely to change unless those outside of Washington demand it.\u201d Following the talk, several students who attended responded favorably to the senator\u2019s remarks. Kennebec Valley Community College student Michael Stevens said he felt Collins made good points when she pointed out problems such as gerrymandering and Internet rhetoric as things that were driving partisanship. \u201cI thought she made some very key points on why we have some bipartisan issues in Congress,\u201d he said. Colby College student Will Levesque, who described himself as an independent, said he was also impressed by her work to reach across party lines. \u201cIt is inspiring to see someone so committed to bipartisan issues,\u201d he said."},

Following the vote, Senator Collins released this statement: \u201cIt is my goal to ensure first and foremost that the Department of Homeland Security is fully funded to perform its dangerous and vital mission to protect our people. \u201cWe must also put the Senate on record in strong opposition to the President\u2019s extraordinarily broad immigration executive order issued last November as a huge abuse of his executive authority that undermines the separation of powers doctrine in our Constitution.

The vote was 51 to 48 with a motion to reconsider the vote pending."},

The President does not have the authority to make sweeping changes in our immigration laws by executive fiat, as he himself has said publicly more than 20 times. \"In keeping with this preliminary court ruling, I would urge my colleagues to pass the compromise that I proposed to resolve the impasse over the executive orders and the funding for the Department of Homeland Security. My proposal would fully fund the Department so that it can carry out its vital mission, would not affect the President's more targeted 2012 executive orders that apply to children who were brought to this country by their parents years ago (the 'dreamers'), but would halt implementation of the broad November executive order consistent with the federal court's ruling. \"The fact that there are now an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States is irrefutable evidence that our immigration and border security systems are badly broken. That's why I believe Congress should consider comprehensive immigration reform and why I supported the bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013. While I was disappointed that immigration reform legislation of some sort did not become law, its failure cannot serve as justification for the action taken by the President last November.\""},
{"title": "Senator Collins Leads Effort To Prevent DHS Funding Lapse, Stop President's Executive Overreach", "date": ["Posted Thu, 04/16/2015 - 13:58"], "release": "WASHINGTON, DC \u2014 Senator Collins spoke on the Senate floor today in support of the bill she authored, the \u201cImmigration Rule of Law Act,\u201d and on the need to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). She offered the bill as a compromise to end the impasse over funding for the Department which oversees our nation\u2019s border protection and immigration agencies. The Senate voted 57 to 42 to proceed to Senator Collins\u2019 bill, but under the Senate rules, 60 votes were required to proceed to debate. Earlier today the Senate approved a \u201cclean\u201d DHS funding bill as part of the compromise Senator Collins helped to craft. As the former Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee and current Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Collins is keenly aware of the risks our country faces from those who would do us harm here at home. The Immigration Rule of Law Act would prevent the extraordinarily broad immigration action issued by the President in November 2014 from going into effect \u2014 an action that a federal court also has blocked. Senator Collins has long called for, and supported, comprehensive immigration reform in our nation; however, the President\u2019s November 2014 immigration executive action exceeds his constitutional authority. In her floor speech Senator Collins said, \u201cThe President\u2019s overreach usurps the role of Congress and undermines our constitutional system of checks and balances. The failure of Congress to pass a law to the President\u2019s liking cannot become an excuse for the President to infringe upon the powers of the legislative branch. The President knows that he lacks the authority to write the law, as he has said on 22 different occasions.\u201d The Senator\u2019s bill would in no way alter or impede the \u201cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u201d (DACA) program for so called \u201cDREAMERS\u201d \u2013 children who were brought to this country at a young age and meet certain criteria \u2013 that was announced by the President in 2012. The program would remain open to individuals who were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012; came to the U.S. before age 16; have lived in the U.S. continuously since June 15, 2007; are in school or have graduated or obtained a GED or have served honorably in the armed forces; and have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanors and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security. More specifically, Senator Collins\u2019 Immigration Rule of Law Act includes three major provisions: - It would bar the Administration from using funding to implement the 2014 immigration orders issued by the President last November, but would leave in place the much more limited 2012 order creating DACA; - It would direct the Department of Homeland Security to give the highest enforcement priority to the deportation of foreign nationals in our country illegally who have been convicted of domestic violence, child abuse, exploitation or a sex crime; and - It includes a Sense of Congress resolution that the executive branch should not act to give foreign nationals who are here illegally an edge in competing for jobs against American citizens or green card holders. In January, the House of Representatives introduced a DHS funding bill that included provisions to block the President\u2019s sweeping immigration action issued last November as well as earlier executive actions related to immigration. Senate Democrats refused to consider that proposal. Since then, Senator Collins has worked to find a compromise upon which both parties could agree. By separating the executive actions from the DHS funding bill, Senator Collins provided the opportunity to vote on a full-year funding bill that could garner the 60 votes necessary to be approved by the full Senate."},

{"title": "Collins, Wyden Offer Bill To Authorize Trade Adjustment Assistance ", "date": ["Posted Thu, 04/16/2015 - 15:55"], "release": "Washington, DC\u2014 Today, Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) and the Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) introduced legislation for a six-year reauthorization of Trade Adjustment Assistance, a critical job training and worker assistance program that strengthens the American workforce and helps make certain the United States can continue to compete successfully in the global economy. \u201cWhen the American workforce is negatively affected by foreign competition, we should ensure that opportunities and resources exist for affected employees to learn new skills. In Maine, TAA has been a crucial lifeline for many employees in trade-impacted industries who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. TAA has been able to provide these workers with job training and other critical services necessary to prepare for and successfully obtain new employment opportunities,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cI look forward to continuing to work closely with Senator Wyden in this bipartisan effort to make certain that these essential programs continue to invest in the American workforce.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud our bill expands Trade Adjustment Assistance programs to broad new segments of the workforce, including service workers and those in manufacturing, to receive training so they can better compete and win in the global economy. TAA is a critical component for our workforce, and expanded TAA should be prioritized in our trade policy.\u201d Senator Wyden said. \u201cThis bill we\u2019re introducing today doubles job training funding. It makes the program whole after the recent cuts it faced in 2014 by supporting workers who were denied TAA or did not apply because they were ineligible to start to receive assistance right away. It also provides a backstop for our fishermen, farmers, and small businesses by providing for a long-term extension of their trade adjustment programs.\u201d Trade Adjustment Assistance provides necessary federal assistance to Americans who have been adversely affected by foreign competition. It can include training programs, skills assessments, and job search assistance. According to the Department of Labor, Maine received $5.4 million and Oregon received nearly $16 million in TAA funding in 2013. Nationwide, the TAA program covered nearly 105,000 workers in 2013, the latest year where data is available. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Enhancement Act of 2015 would authorize the TAA programs under parameters that were set in a bipartisan, bicameral agreement in 2011. The bipartisan bill extends TAA programs through June 30, 2021 and would make new workers eligible for assistance to ensure employees in all sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, services and agriculture, receive the training and assistance they need. The bill also reinstates a critically important expired provision so workers can be eligible to receive TAA if their jobs were outsourced to countries where we do not have free-trade agreements, including India and China."},

The Every Child Achieves Act takes important steps in the direction of improved student performance and closing achievement gaps while providing more flexibility over how to meet the needs of students. \u201cIt is also important that students in rural America have the same access to federal dollars as those who attend school in urban and suburban communities. Federal competitive grant programs, however, tend to favor large school districts that have the ability to apply for those grants because of these districts\u2019 larger staffs. I am pleased that the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP), which I authored with former Senator Kent Conrad in 2002, has been extended with this bill. It provides financial assistance to small and high-poverty rural districts to help them address their unique local needs and meet federal requirements. REAP has helped to support new technology in classrooms, distance learning opportunities, and professional development activities, as well as an array of other programs that help support students and teachers in rural districts.\u201d In this week\u2019s HELP Committee markup, Senator Collins offered a bipartisan amendment that would improve a pilot program to support states like Maine that are designing alternative assessment systems based on student proficiency and competency, not just traditional annual tests. The Collins-Sanders Amendment passed 22-0 and makes certain that five states will be able to participate in this pilot program and that school districts have the full five years of the program to scale up their systems statewide. \u201cIn Maine, educators are working hard to develop high quality assessments that could not only help students learn, but also measure their growth better than the traditional testing methods mandated by the No Child Left Behind law,\" Senator Collins said. \"I am particularly pleased that this bill includes an Innovative Assessment and Accountability pilot program, which would support states that are designing assessment systems beyond annual testing and that are focused on student growth and proficiency.\u201d Several other amendments cosponsored by Senator Collins passed the Committee unanimously, including support for quality after-school and summer programs through 21st Century Community Learning Center program, and literacy and arts education programming for disadvantaged students and children with disabilities.

{"title": "Are 52 Million Americans At An Unnecessary Risk For Identity Theft?", "date": ["Posted Fri, 04/17/2015 - 17:16"], "release": "As Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I oversee the Committee\u2019s Fraud Hotline (1-855-303-9470). This hotline has been a useful tool to enable seniors and their loved ones to report instances of scams and fraud targeted at our nation\u2019s seniors. The hotline has also provided Committee investigators with useful information as we work to educate seniors about these scams and help put a stop to them. The hotline recently received a call from an individual in Maine who had just celebrated his 65th birthday, reaching the eligibility age for Medicare. He applied for Medicare, which is a routine process, and a few weeks later, he received his Medicare card in the mail. When he opened the envelope containing his card, he was surprised and alarmed to learn that Medicare cards prominently display Social Security Numbers (SSNs). This card, he explained, puts him at a great risk of identity theft, especially if it were lost or stolen. This individual has good reason to be concerned, as do the more than 52 million Americans that have Medicare cards. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), identity theft has been the most common consumer complaint over the past 15 years. In 2014 alone, more than 332,000 Americans, including 693 Mainers, reported being victimized by someone who had stolen their identity. Also according to the FTC, 20 percent of identity theft complaints in 2014 were reported by individuals over age 60. In 2004\u2014more than a decade ago\u2014the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that the widespread use of SSNs as identifiers by both public and private sector organizations provided ample opportunity for criminals to obtain and use these numbers to commit identity theft. Subsequently, in 2007, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed all federal agencies to develop plans for reducing unnecessary usage of SSNs and transition to alternative identifier numbers. Since then, many federal agencies that had used SSNs as identifiers, including the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, have ultimately removed SSNs from their identification cards. In recent years, other organizations, such as private health insurers and state agencies, also discontinued use of SSNs as identifiers in order to protect individuals from identity theft. In Maine, for example, a drivers\u2019 license now bears a seven-digit number as an identifier, rather than a driver\u2019s SSN. Since the GAO initially raised this issue, the agency has made numerous subsequent recommendations that SSNs be removed from Medicare cards. Inspectors General for the Department of Social Security Administration have made similar recommendations as well. Most recently, in its 2015 High Risk Series report, the GAO again designated Medicare as a high-risk program and recommended that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) \u201ceffectively and cost-effectively identify, design, develop, and implement an information technology solution that addresses the removal of Social Security numbers from Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 health insurance cards.\u201d Yet, despite all of these warnings, it does not appear to be a priority of CMS to take this important step toward helping to protect our nation\u2019s seniors from identity theft. Early last month, the Aging Committee\u2019s Ranking Member, Claire McCaskill and I sent a letter to CMS to inquire about this important issue. In our letter, we asked specific questions about what actions CMS has taken to remove SSNs from Medicare cards. In addition, Congress recently passed legislation that directs CMS to take this important action. But by all accounts, the agency appears no closer than it ever was to making this important, common-sense change to Medicare cards. Recent massive cyberattacks by hackers\u2014including a breach of Anthem, the nation\u2019s second largest health insurance company\u2014may have compromised sensitive information of more than 312,000 Mainers and as many as 80 million current and former Anthem customers nationwide. These attacks have justifiably prompted renewed calls for CMS to remove SSNs from Medicare cards. It is critical that this issue be a high priority for CMS. I will continue to press CMS to do more to protect the identity of our nation\u2019s seniors and Medicare card holders."},
{"title": "Impressions From My Journey To Selma", "date": ["Posted Fri, 03/13/2015 - 18:54"], "release": "As a young girl growing up in Northern Maine, the turmoil in the South during the 1960\u2019s seemed a world away to me. Our schools focused mainly on earlier periods of American history. We learned about the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation, but as students, we were not fully aware of the discrimination, marches, and violence roiling our country, including the bloodshed in Selma, Alabama. So when Senator Tim Scott, the first African-American Senator elected from the south since 1881, invited me to the Faith & Politics Pilgrimage to Selma to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march known as \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d I quickly accepted. During that weekend, I learned of extraordinary courage, astonishing forgiveness, and changed lives. A discussion of our journey must start with our leader, John Lewis, a congressman and civil rights hero who led the marchers as they began their walk from Selma to Montgomery across the infamous Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7, 1965. At Brown Chapel at Selma\u2019s AME Church, he described to us in vivid detail organizing the march for voting rights and then leading the 600 \u201cfoot soldiers,\u201d marching peacefully two-by-two along the sidewalk on the bridge, only to be confronted by a wall of Alabama State Troopers and sheriffs who clubbed the unarmed demonstrators and choked them with tear gas. John Lewis\u2019s skull was fractured, and it was not certain that he would live. Catholic nuns at a nearby hospital took in the wounded and cared for them. Congressman Lewis is eloquent when he describes the injustices of those times. In Lowndes County, Alabama, the population was 80 percent African-American, yet not a single black citizen was registered to vote. Those who tried to register were confronted with impossible barriers like having to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar, or were handed a bar of soap and asked how many bubbles it contained. Literacy tests and poll taxes were common as was a requirement that a white person vouch for the black American\u2019s character. But what most amazed me about Congressman Lewis was his infinite capacity for forgiveness. Not a trace of bitterness is present in his retelling of the repeated beatings and jailings he endured as he fought for justice and equality as the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He told a moving story of one of his attackers coming to his office many years later to ask for forgiveness. Peggy Wallace Kennedy, daughter of Governor George Wallace who ordered the state troopers to assault the peaceful marchers, was one of the participants of the ceremony at the Bridge. The powerful themes of redemption and forgiveness resonated throughout the weekend. African-American churches played an enormous role in the civil rights movement. Not only were many of the leaders ministers, such as John Lewis, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Sr., but also the churches were gathering places, sources of inspiration, and sanctuaries for the marchers. There were so many poignant moments during our pilgrimage. We visited the 16th Street Baptist Church where four young girls were killed by a KKK bomb during choir practice in 1963, a crime so heinous that it proved to be a turning point in the struggle. Another were the remarks of Mary Liuzzo Lilleboe, whose mother Viola Liuzzo, a white woman from Michigan and mother of five young children, was shot by the Klan as she helped drive the protesters. Mary described the last call from her mother at 8 p.m., saying that she was fine. The children marched around the living room with homemade signs in support of their mom and the marchers. Mary once was asked how could her mother have gone to Alabama, to which she replied, \u201cwhy wasn\u2019t everyone in Alabama?\u201d I met David Goodman, whose brother Andrew Goodman was one of three white civil rights activists murdered in Mississippi. David was just 17 when the call came that Andrew, age 20, had been murdered. Thousands came to Alabama from all over the country to stand tall for justice and voting rights for African-Americans. They marched and were protected by the National Guard. Their actions, led and inspired by the pioneers of the movement like John Lewis who was arrested 40 times and suffered so much, led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Luci Baines Johnson told me this story of her father, President Johnson, signing this historic law. As a teenager watching her father at the ceremony, she saw him give the first signing pen to Republican Leader Senator Everett Dirksen, who coauthored the bill with Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield. \u201cDaddy,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhy did you give that pen to that grumpy old Republican?\u201d \u201cBecause, Luci Baines,\u201d he replied, \u201cwithout the Republicans, that would have been just a bill, not a law.\u201d The weekend was capped off by an eloquent speech by President Obama and the powerful presence of President Bush and his wife. I cannot remember the last time a former President came to an event not to speak but to bear witness. Then we all marched in unity on that infamous bridge, commemorating the heroes who sacrificed so much. I am grateful for the opportunity to have participated in a weekend where I learned so much and met so many inspiring people who risked everything for justice."},
{"title": "Senators Collins And Schumer Introduce Legislation To Make Home Health Care More Accessible To Medicare Patients", "date": ["Posted Wed, 03/04/2015 - 13:38"], "release": "WASHINGTON, DC-- As leading proponents of home health care and ensuring that Medicare patients have access to this crucial health care option, Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) have authored the \u201cHome Health Care Planning Improvement Act.\u201d The bill will improve the access Medicare beneficiaries have to home health care by allowing physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and certified nurse midwives to order home health services, all of which are playing increasingly important roles in the delivery of health care, particularly in rural and underserved areas of our nation. Under current law, only physicians are allowed to certify or initiate home health care for Medicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the with the patient\u2019s case as the non-physician provider. In some cases, the certifying physician may not even have a relationship with the patient and must rely on the recommendation of the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist or certified nurse midwife to order the medically necessary home health care. In too many cases, these requirements create obstacles, delays and unnecessary paperwork to the process before home health care can be provided. The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act removes the needless delays in getting Medicare patients the home health care they need simply because a physician is not available to sign the form required by law. Senator Collins said, \u201cI have learned of far too many cases of seniors who experienced unnecessary delays in accessing home health care simply because of the burdensome requirement that only physicians can order such services. Home health care is a crucial component to quality health care and should be more accessible to Medicare patients. It is common sense that other medical professionals \u2013 who in many cases are the patient\u2019s primary care provider -- should be able to order these services.\u201d Senator Schumer said, \u201cOur seniors should not have to wait unnecessarily or experience unreasonable delays in their health care because a doctor is unavailable to sign the form that will approve them for home health services. Our top-notch nurse practitioners, midwives and specialists, who often develop the relationships with these patients, should also be able to provide the final sign-off needed to bring some of our most vulnerable community members the quality care they need in the comfort of their own home. This bill will help us remove red tape and streamline the process so we can bring these seniors quality home health care as soon as possible.\u201d The Collins-Schumer legislation is supported by a broad coalition of organizations, including the AARP, the National Council on Aging, the American Geriatrics Society, the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, the American Nurses Association, the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American College of Nurse Midwives, and the Visiting Nurse Associations of America."},

Her speech also identified areas for further reform in the intelligence community to address emerging challenges. Senator Collins\u2019 full remarks, as prepared for delivery, can be read below: \u201cThank you, John [Negroponte], for that kind introduction. I am delighted to kick off today\u2019s events. This room is brimming with dedicated public servants and patriots, including the two other past Directors of National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell and Admiral Blair, and I understand the current DNI will participate later today. \u201cLet me begin by describing the all-consuming five months of legislative activity that led to the enactment of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. That history has ramifications for the substance of the bill that was ultimately signed into law. \u201cWhen I reflect on those five months, there were three factors that led to the passage of the sweeping Intel Reform law. \u201cFirst, when the 9/11 Commission released its final report on July 22nd, 2004, the Senate leadership assigned Senator Joe Lieberman and me the task of developing legislation to implement its recommendations. I was chairman of the then-Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, and Joe was the ranking member. \u201cDespite our party differences, Senator Lieberman and I shared two attributes that were notably absent in Washington then and now: we had always worked together on a bipartisan basis and had a solid record of actually passing legislation. \u201cSo, rather than sending the 9-11 Commission\u2019s recommendations to the Armed Services, Intelligence, or Judiciary Committees, all of which felt that they had jurisdiction but where the bureaucratic turf war we needed to rise above might be exacerbated, the Senate Leaders assigned to our Committee the job of translating the recommendations into legislation. \u201cThe second key to producing a bill was an agreement that Senator Lieberman and I made the very next day, on July 23rd, 2004. We agreed to work out any differences we had in private, and to always present a united bipartisan front to our Committee, our respective caucuses, the White House, and the public. \u201cThe third, and most important factor, was the support of the 9/11 families and of the co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission \u2013 Lee Hamilton and Tom Kean. \u201cIt is difficult to overstate the heightened atmosphere in which this legislation was being developed. One hearing coincided with the third anniversary of 9/11; other hearings took place during a time of an elevated terrorist alert in Washington and New York and overlapped with construction workers installing security barricades at the Capitol. \u201cSeveral hearings occurred during the sacred August recess as Joe and I cut short our time in our home states and returned to Washington. \u201cWe heard from more than two dozen witnesses, including the directors of the FBI and the CIA, intelligence experts, field operatives, and members of the 9/11 families. I\u2019ll never forget the words spoken by Mary Fetchet, whose son, Brad, died in the World Trade Center: \u2018When American lives are at stake, indifference or inertia is unacceptable \u2026When critical reforms are implemented to make our country safer, I will know that neither Brad\u2019s life, nor the lives of nearly 3,000 others who perished on September 11th, were lost in vain\u2019 \u201cThose were the words that motivated me throughout the difficult negotiations. After much debate and consideration of some 300 amendments, the comprehensive, bipartisan bill that we had reported out of our Committee unanimously passed on the Senate floor by a vote of 96 to 2. It would be easy to misconstrue this overwhelming vote in the Senate as a sign that the legislation would have smooth sailing, but in fact, rocky shoals lay ahead of us. \u201cThe key issues in the conference between the House and the Senate were the respective powers of the DNI and the Counterterrorism Center, and the relationship between the new DNI and the Department of Defense. The lead conferees on the House side, former Representatives Jane Harman and Peter Hoekstra, largely agreed with the Senate bill. \u201cNevertheless, conference was like that arcade game Whack-a-Mole \u2013 just as one issue was resolved, another popped up. Many days I thought the bill was dead, but by November 20th, 2004, we thought we had all the moles whacked. \u201cThen, in the late afternoon, the House adjourned for Thanksgiving without voting due to objections from two powerful House chairmen who did not want a reform bill. \u201cWe called that day \u201cBlack Saturday\u201d because the conventional wisdom was that the bill was dead. Nobody would want to come back for a few days after Thanksgiving to work on so difficult a bill. But those of us who believed in the bill and who were inspired by the 9/11 families who refused to give up. \u201cIn order to get a bill, we had to figure out how to satisfy the concerns of the House Armed Services Committee chairman, Duncan Hunter, who was convinced that a strong DNI would somehow compromise the intelligence that flowed to our troops in Iraq and undermine the chain of command. It would be an understatement to say that Secretary Rumsfeld was not a fan of the bill despite the President\u2019s support for it. \u201cSecretary of State Colin Powell, a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had testified that our bill would improve the quality of military intelligence, but we couldn\u2019t convince the House chairman of that. \u201cOn the evening of Sunday December 5th, I was working late, consulting with my staff and the White House. Without an agreement by the next day, time would simply run out as there were very few days left in the session. \u201cWe proposed language saying that the bill shall \u201crespect and not abrogate\u201d the authority of the Cabinet Secretaries. The result was that the DNI would retain budgetary and personnel guidance for the intelligence community, while making clear that we were not seeking to alter the military chain of command. \u201cI sent a Blackberry message to Senator Lieberman who happened to be at the Kennedy Center that Sunday night. In the middle of Billy Joel playing a tribute to Elton John, he got my message and concurred with the change, without missing a beat. At 11:24 p.m. on that Sunday night, we finally had an agreement at the very last minute. \u201cOverall, I have no doubt that these reforms have made our country safer, although, of course, no law can make us completely safe, particularly in a world where we see the metastasizing of Islamist extremism. \u201cWe implemented nearly all of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, including creating the DNI and the NCTC and several reforms identified in previous intelligence panels. \u201cTo address intelligence failures regarding the extent of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction programs, we required the DNI to issue uniform Analytic Tradecraft Standards and to ensure that the input of every element of the community is heard when the most important intelligence assessments are produced. \u201cLet me describe in greater detail my view of the three organizational reforms made in the bill: the creation of the DNI, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. \u201cThe Director of National Intelligence was intended to give our intelligence community what Secretary Powell called \u201can empowered quarterback.\u201d Our concern with the structure at the time was that no one person has sufficient bandwidth to simultaneously lead the CIA and coordinate the activities of the broader community. \u201cThis concern was validated by testimony from previous DCIs and from the conclusion of the 9-11 Commission which said that good people can overcome bad structures, but they should not have to do so. \u201cToday, as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I am more aware than ever of the constant challenges facing the CIA director. As a result, I believe strongly that one person cannot fully fulfill the responsibilities of that role as well as the duties that Director Clapper is now performing as a full-time job. \u201cBuilding upon the arduous work of the first three DNIs to establish an office from scratch, Director Clapper now budgets, coordinates, and manages the activities of the Intelligence Community in a manner that we hoped the DNI would when we first drafted the bill in these ways: \u2022 \u201cHe servers the President as the nation\u2019s top intelligence adviser. \u2022 \u201cHe views the Community as a coordinated network that can increase value rather than as a forum to win and lose turf battles. \u2022 \u201cHis influence is derived as much from relationships he has built during his five decades of public service as it is from the authority granted to him by the law we authored. \u201cWhen we created the National Counterterrorism Center, we gave it the following mission: \u201cTo serve as the primary organization in the United States Government for analyzing and integrating all intelligence possessed or acquired by the United States Government pertaining to terrorism and counterterrorism\u2026\u201d \u201cTalk about a daunting task. I remember visiting the Terrorism Threat Integration Center set up by President Bush and headed by John Brennan. John had five different servers under his desk and a very small staff that was eager and smart, but extremely young and inexperienced. What a difference NCTC has made since then! \u201cThe progress at NCTC \u2013 whether measured in integration of intelligence, the expertise of its analysis, or the advances in technology -- is immense. The day after 9/11, few would have imagined that we would go 14 years without another catastrophic terrorist attack on the U.S. homeland. In this respect, more than any other institution established in the reform bill, NCTC has lived up to what we hoped it would be. \u201cUnfortunately, implementation of other reforms has been uneven. Such is the case of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, my biggest disappointment particularly since I fought hard for its creation. \u201cAfter 9/11, Senator Lieberman and I recognized that an overreaction in the aftermath of such a horrific attack could undermine the very values that we hold dear as Americans. We created the Board as a way to demonstrate our belief that we do not have to choose between security and protecting privacy and civil liberties. \u201cBoth the Bush and Obama Administrations failed to nominate members in a timely manner. As a result, the Board was not fully constituted or staffed until May 7, 2013 \u2013 this date was nine years after the passage of the Intel Reform bill. \u201cNow that the Board is up and running, I found the Board\u2019s second report regarding the implementation of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to represent the kind of oversight we envisioned the Board would perform. \u201cUnlike the Board\u2019s first divisive report issued last January on the NSA phone records program, the second report included findings that were unanimous among Board members, careful in its recommendations, and valuable in its contributions for policy-makers and the public alike. \u201cTen years after the passage of the intelligence reform law, it may seem appealing to ponder whether the DNI has sufficient authority to match the corresponding responsibilities Congress assigned to the Director ten years ago. \u201cWhile I have my own views on this subject, it is a distant priority in my mind compared to the urgency of implementing reforms to address the rapidly emerging cyber threats our country faces today. \u201cOther nations cannot match the strength of our military, our economy, and they likely cannot duplicate the sophistication of our intelligence gathering or offensive capability in the digital domain. \u201cIt is equally true, however, that no other country is as dependent as we are on the security of vulnerable networks for survival, the conduct of intelligence activities, and to project the very military power upon which our national security rests. \u201cThe cyber thefts and attacks against government and business targets in the last two years should leave no doubt that we have not begun to bring this problem under control: Anthem/WellPoint, Sony Entertainment, Home Depot, Target, the U.S. Postal Service, NOAA, and Nieman Marcus to name just a few of the red flags. The Department of Defense fends off literally millions of scans and probes each day. \u201cAs one former official told the 9/11 Commission last year in preparation of its valuable 10th anniversary report: \u201cWe are at September 10th levels in terms of cyber preparedness.\u201d I consider the Senate\u2019s failure to pass the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 that Senator Lieberman and I wrote to be the one major piece of unfinished business before our tenure as the heads of the Governmental Affairs and Homeland Security Committee was over. \u201cLet me share with you my view of the major reforms that should be made immediately to address this threat: \u201cFirst, Congress needs to pass legislation to make it easier for public and private sector entities to share cyber threat vulnerability information. That means some liability protections for the private sector. I expect the Senate Intelligence Committee will mark up such a bill as early as next week. \u201cSecond, owners and operators of the country\u2019s most critical infrastructure should be required to report significant cyber intrusions that could compromise their industrial control systems. \u201cNearly all states already require companies to notify consumers if certain personally identifiable information is breached, and national security contractors already must report intrusions of information systems that hold classified information pursuant to recent provisions in the defense and intelligence authorization bills. \u201cIf the loss of classified information and consumers\u2019 personal information warrant reporting of cyber incidents, cyber attacks that can disrupt the life-sustaining systems that our country depend upon warrant equal or greater reporting to the federal government. \u201cAnother urgent need is to address zero-day vulnerabilities. The Assistant Director of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division, Joe Demarest, testified before Congress that the malware in the North Korean cyber attack on Sony would probably have gotten past \u201c90 percent of the defenses that are out there today both in industry and in government.\" \u201cSimply put, intrusion detection systems like the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Einstein system cannot identify signatures they are not unaware of. \u201cNow more than ever, the Intelligence Community can benefit from the very type of private sector innovation that In-Q-Tel seeks to foster. The risk posed by insider threats, the challenge of securing information systems, and the exploitation of social media by terrorist groups are a few of the challenges where the creativity and insights of American high-tech companies could contribute to the extraordinary work already being performed in the Community. \u201cFinally, no discussion about the integrated intelligence community would be complete without addressing the challenge posed by insider threats aided by digital technology. \u201cEdward Snowden, and Private Manning before him, did not enjoy special access as a result of their high-rank or seniority; they did not have to rely upon unique computer tools, and I have seen no public evidence that they required any foreign assistance in stealing the information they took. \u201cHow is it possible, then, that an intelligence community capable of extraordinary cyber operations in the digital space failed to stop Edward Snowden in his tracks before he caused irreparable damage? \u201cThe hard truth is that it was a failure to implement basic security, rather than a failure of the \u201cneed to share\u201d culture, that allowed Edward Snowden to walk off with so many of the Community\u2019s digital secrets. \u201cAcknowledging this reality is crucial because some advocates of stove-piping and the \u201cneed to know\u201d culture of old have pointed to the Snowden theft as proof that a \u201cneed to share\u201d culture is incompatible with the security necessary to carry out intelligence activities. \u201cWorking together, Congress, the Intelligence Community, and industry can and must work together to prevent the cyber 9/11 that we know will happen if we do not take action now. \u201cAs Mary Fetchet reminded us more than a decade ago, indifference or inertia is unacceptable. Thank you, I am happy to take your questions."},

Many schools lack the right equipment and infrastructure for preparing meals with fresh, healthy ingredients. The School Food Modernization Act would establish a loan guarantee, grant, and technical assistance program within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to help schools acquire the new equipment needed to prepare healthier, more nutritious meals. \u201cWith more than 30 million children participating in the National School Lunch Program every school day, the food served to these children has a demonstrable effect on their health and well-being,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cIn Maine, 40 percent of children qualify for free or reduced-price meals based on household income, and we need to start school children off with the right food every day so they are able to concentrate in the classroom and succeed in their studies. The School Food Modernization Act will help assist schools in providing healthier meals to students throughout the country.\u201d School administrators or other eligible borrowers could obtain federal guarantees for 80 percent of the loan value needed to construct, remodel, or expand school kitchens, dining, or food storage infrastructure. Targeted grant assistance would give school administrators and food service directors the seed funding needed to upgrade kitchen infrastructure or purchase kitchen equipment such as commercial ovens, steamers, and stoves. The bill would also strengthen training and technical assistance to help school food service personnel meet nutrition standards. \u201cThe right kitchen tools and techniques save time and money, making it easier to serve the healthy, scratch-cooked meals that our students enjoy,\u201d said Melanie Lagasse, Food Service Manager for the New Sweden School Department in Aroostook County, Maine. \u201cOutdated equipment and limited professional training are serious obstacles to better school food, and investments that address these challenges would quickly benefit the health of kids in my district and across Maine.\u201d As schools across the nation work to meet USDA school meal standards and serve healthier, more nutritious meals, they must have access to the right tools to do so. Schools built decades ago often lack the infrastructure necessary to prepare meals rich in fresh ingredients and must rely on workarounds that are expensive, inefficient, and unsustainable. The School Food Modernization Act would help schools expand their services beyond just reheating and holding food for meal service."},
{"title": "Collins, King Support Gov. LePage's FEMA Request To Declare Major Disaster In Maine ", "date": ["Posted Thu, 03/05/2015 - 13:03"], "release": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 In a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Craig Fugate, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Angus King (I-ME) backed Maine Governor Paul LePage\u2019s request to declare a major disaster for Androscoggin, Cumberland, Sagadahoc, and York Counties. \u201cThe severity of the January 26-28 storm resulted in manpower, equipment, and materials expenditures that have exceeded the budgets of many communities throughout the State. This problem has been exacerbated by the constant onslaught of severe weather to hit the State and frigid temperatures that have kept snow banks high,\u201d wrote Senators Collins and King. \u201cSnow totals for January were more than twice the normal level, and totals for February were more than three times the normal level.\u201d Senators Collins and King previously sent a letter to Administrator Fugate on February 18th requesting assistance to towns in Washington County that had been his especially hard by successive snowstorms. Following the letter, FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate spoke with Senator Collins agreeing to reassess the policy that would have excluded Washington County from receiving federal assistance. FEMA generally considers only the snowfall from a single storm, rather than the cumulative total from multiple storms, in determining whether to provide assistance. The full text of the letter to Administrator Fugate can be read below: The Honorable Craig W. Fugate Administrator Federal Emergency Management Agency 500 C Street S.W. Washington, DC 20472 Dear Administrator Fugate: We are writing to express support for the request by Maine Governor Paul LePage, dated February 27, 2015, that you declare a major disaster for the State of Maine as a result of a snowstorm, severe winter storm, and flooding that occurred January 26-28, 2015. On January 26, 2015, the State activated its Emergency Operations Plan, and Governor LePage declared a statewide State of Emergency the following day. As a result of a series of severe winter storms that swept through the state this season, the State of Emergency remained in effect through February 27, 2015. The storm that struck sections of Maine from January 26-28 brought with it record snowfall, strong winds, severe wave action, coastal flooding, and blizzard conditions. In Androscoggin, Cumberland, Sagadahoc, and York Counties, snowfall totals ranged from 20 inches to more than 30 inches in some places. Local impacts included the cost of snow removal; airport closures; suspension of ferry, bus, and intercity train service; and damage to snow removal equipment. Several hospitals had staff shelter on-site to ensure that there would be sufficient staff to report to work. Maine requested a Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) for Snow Assistance and Public Assistance on February 12, 2015, for Androscoggin, Cumberland, Sagadahoc, and York Counties. Damage estimates verified by the PDA equate to more than $2.5 million or $1.91 per capita. While snow removal is a typical expense for which Maine communities plan, the severity of the January 26-28 storm resulted in manpower, equipment, and materials expenditures that have exceeded the budgets of many communities throughout the State. This problem has been exacerbated by the constant onslaught of severe weather to hit the State and frigid temperatures that have kept snow banks high. The City of Portland has received more than seven feet of snow so far this winter. Snow totals for January were more than twice the normal level, and totals for February were more than three times the normal level. Furthermore, these dangerous conditions are a reality across the entire State, not only in the counties included in Governor LePage\u2019s request. You will recall that we wrote to you in February about the large impact of storms in Washington County, where many towns face snow levels that are unparalleled in the past 100 years. We urge you to give expeditious consideration and approval of the Governor\u2019s request and declare a major disaster for Androscoggin, Cumberland, Sagadahoc, and York Counties."},

{"title": "Protecting Our Youth, Ending Human Trafficking", "date": ["Posted Fri, 03/06/2015 - 14:12"], "release": "This past New Year\u2019s Eve, a man and woman were arrested in Bangor for allegedly forcing a 13-year-old Maine girl into prostitution. This child, who was listed as a missing person, was being sold for sex through ads on the Internet. A Bangor police officer, posing as a \u201cjohn,\u201d arranged online to meet the girl at a motel, where she was freed from a life of slavery and returned to her home. This horrifying story is but the tip of an iceberg. These human traffickers prey upon the most vulnerable, often homeless runaways. They lure their victims into lives of commercial sex with promises of money and sometimes drugs, and keep them captive with lies, threats, and violence. Many criminals who once dealt drugs now participate in sex trafficking because it is more profitable and less risky. Every year, tens of thousands of American children and teenagers fall victim to sex traffickers in addition to the countless other young people smuggled into our country from overseas for this despicable purpose. Congress must do more to provide law enforcement with the tools it needs to pursue sex trafficking and to support preventive programs that help vulnerable young people who fall victim to trafficking. I recently had the opportunity to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of legislation that advances those goals. In January, I joined Senator Patrick Leahy in authoring bipartisan legislation, now pending in the Senate, for a preventive measure that would strengthen housing programs and services for homeless juveniles, who often fall prey to traffickers. No young person should have to choose between selling their bodies and a safe place to sleep. The Judiciary Committee already has passed two anti-trafficking bills that will be up for full Senate consideration. One would create a new source of financing for victim services and law enforcement with enhanced fines on criminals convicted of human trafficking and child pornography. The other would encourage states to treat those who are preyed upon by sex traffickers as victims instead of prosecuting them as criminals. The House has approved similar bills. Another story from Maine helps illustrate both the harrowing experiences faced by young sex trafficking victims and also the importance of service providers in changing the course of the survivor\u2019s life. In 2013, Preble Street, an organization that operates a homeless shelter and teen center in Portland, formed the Preble Street Anti-Trafficking Coalition \u2013 a group of outreach, health, case management, and legal service providers. With the support of a Department of Justice grant, this Coalition has brought together organizations such as Catholic Charities of Maine, the Sexual Assault Response Services of Southern Maine, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office. It is currently working with approximately 50 trafficking victims, whose ages range from 15 to 42. One young woman, now 20-years-old, had been a familiar face around the Preble Street Teen Center. She was in and out of the foster care system, and met other girls who introduced her to \u201csurvival sex\u201d \u2013 a way to trade sex for a place to sleep and other basic necessities. At age 16, she traded sex for a ride to Boston. Once in Boston, she met a man who prostituted her to other men, in Boston and back in Maine. She was sold to other pimps and endured physical abuse and violence for many years. When she eventually escaped and her traffickers were charged by police, she had nowhere to go but the local homeless shelter. In fact, police chiefs, prosecutors, and service providers in Maine tell me that the lack of aftercare services, including a safe place to sleep, is among the greatest challenges that victims face. Today, the Preble Street Anti-Trafficking Coalition is helping this young woman and others like her start a new life. She is doing well and was able to testify against her trafficker in court \u2013 a very brave and traumatic ordeal for a victim. It is not surprising that Portland\u2019s homeless shelter is a critical partner in the fight to end human trafficking. Approximately one in four homeless youth are victims of sex trafficking or engage in survival sex, and 48 percent of homeless youth have done so because they did not have a safe place to stay. The bill Senator Leahy and I authored, the Runaway and Homeless Youth Trafficking Prevention Act, reauthorizes critical preventive and treatment services that help homeless youth around the country. Despite the recent decline we have seen in chronic homelessness, there are still more than 1.6 million homeless teens in the United States. As Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, one of my goals is to make sure our nation\u2019s homeless youth have the same opportunity to succeed as other youth. Our health care workers in Maine are also tremendous partners in helping to address these crimes. St. Joseph Hospital in Bangor, Maine, has focused its efforts on educating and training clinicians and emergency medical providers to recognize the signs of human trafficking among their patients. With the proper tools and training, these clinicians can intervene in human trafficking cases and help these atrocities from continuing. Maine is doing its part to end this scourge, where the \u201cNot Here\u201d Justice in Action Network brings together law enforcement and service providers to raise awareness about trafficking. Maine\u2019s Sex Trafficking Action Response Team and the Attorney General\u2019s Human Trafficking Workgroup also provide statewide platforms for sharing resources. Those efforts, along with the work underway in Congress, are shining a bright light on some of the darkest stories imaginable."},
{"title": "ICYMI: \"Senator Collins: Selma A Testament To The Power Of Courage, Forgiveness\"", "date": ["Posted Tue, 03/10/2015 - 18:15"], "release": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 On the 50th anniversary of \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d U.S. Senator Susan Collins traveled to Selma, Alabama, to participate in the Bipartisan Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage. The trip commemorated the famous civil rights march that led to the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

The march was stopped by law enforcement who attacked the peaceful demonstrators with clubs and tear gas. Following the pilgrimage, Senator Collins wrote about her reflections from the trip. Senator Collins\u2019 op-ed was published in today\u2019s Portland Press Herald and can be read below. Sen. Susan Collins: Selma, a testament to the power of courage, forgiveness Fifty years after 'Bloody Sunday,' a Maine senator joins the march to honor civil rights-era heroes. As a young girl growing up in northern Maine, the turmoil in the South during the 1960s seemed a world away to me. So when South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only African-American in the Senate, invited me to the Faith and Politics Pilgrimage to Selma to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the infamous civil rights march known as \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d I quickly accepted. During that weekend, I learned of extraordinary courage, astonishing forgiveness and changed lives. A discussion of our journey must start with our leader, John Lewis, a congressman and civil rights hero who led the marchers as they began their walk from Selma to Montgomery across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 7, 1965. At Brown Chapel at Selma\u2019s AME Church, he described to us in vivid detail organizing the march for voting rights and then leading the 600 \u201cfoot soldiers,\u201d marching peacefully two-by-two along the sidewalk on the bridge, only to be confronted by a wall of Alabama state troopers and sheriffs who clubbed the unarmed demonstrators, turned on powerful fire hoses and choked them with tear gas. John Lewis\u2019 skull was fractured, and it was not certain he would live. Catholic nuns at a nearby hospital took in the wounded. Rep. Lewis is eloquent when he describes the injustices of those times. In Lowndes County, Alabama, the population was 80 percent African-American, yet not a single black citizen was registered to vote. Those who tried were confronted with impossible barriers like having to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar, or were handed a bar of soap and asked how many bubbles it contained. Literacy tests and poll taxes were common, as was a requirement that a white person vouch for the black American\u2019s character. But what most amazed me about Rep. Lewis was his infinite capacity for forgiveness. Not a trace of bitterness affects his retelling of the repeated beatings and jailings he endured as he fought for equality as chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. He told a moving story of one of his attackers coming to his office many years later to ask for forgiveness. Peggy Wallace Kennedy, daughter of Gov. George Wallace, who ordered the state troopers to assault the peaceful marchers, was one of the participants at the Edmund Pettus Bridge ceremony. The powerful themes of redemption and forgiveness resonated throughout the weekend. African-American churches played an enormous role in the civil rights movement. Many of the leaders were ministers, such as John Lewis, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy Sr., and the churches were gathering places, sanctuaries and sources of inspiration. There were so many poignant moments during our pilgrimage. We visited the 16th Street Baptist Church where four young girls were killed by a Ku Klux Klan bomb during choir practice in 1963, a crime so heinous it proved to be a turning point in the struggle. We listened to the remarks of Mary Lilleboe, whose mother, Viola Liuzzo, a white woman with five young children, was shot by the Klan as she helped drive the protesters. Mary described the last phone call from her mother at 8 p.m., saying she was fine. The children marched around the living room with homemade signs in support of their mom and the marchers. Mary once was asked how her mother could have gone to Alabama, to which she replied: \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t everyone in Alabama?\u201d I also met David Goodman, whose brother Andrew Goodman was one of three white civil rights activists murdered in Mississippi. David was just 17 when the call came that Andrew, age 20, had been murdered. Thousands from all over the country came to Selma to stand tall for justice and voting rights for African-Americans, and were protected by the National Guard. Their actions, inspired by leaders like John Lewis, who was arrested 40 times and suffered so much, led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Luci Baines Johnson told me this story of her father, President Johnson, signing this historic law. As a teenager watching her father at the ceremony, she saw him give the first signing pen to Republican Senate leader Everett Dirksen, who coauthored the bill with Democratic leader Mike Mansfield. \u201cDaddy,\u201d she asked, why did you give that pen to that grumpy old Republican?\u201d \u201cBecause, Luci Baines,\u201d he replied, \u201cwithout the Republicans, this would have been just a bill, not a law.\u201d The weekend was capped off by an eloquent speech by President Obama and the powerful presence of former President George W. Bush. I cannot remember the last time a former president came to an event not to speak, but to bear witness. Then we all marched in unity on that infamous bridge, commemorating the heroes who sacrificed so much. Please click   to read the op-ed on the Portland Press Herald website."},

The hearing was titled, \u201cBridging the Gap: How Prepared are Americans for Retirement?\u201d Witnesses included Maine Savings FCU official Rob Carmichael and Jean Chatzky, financial journalist and financial editor for NBC\u2019s Today Show Senator Collins said, \u201cThe issue of retirement security is of great importance not only to those in or nearing retirement, but also to all Americans who hope to enjoy their retirement years without fearing they will run out of money and fall into poverty.\u201d During the hearing, Dr. Alicia Munnell of Boston College, who also served as a witness, said that the estimated gap between the savings American households need to maintain their standard of living in retirement and what they have actually saved is an astounding $7.7 trillion. Witnesses discussed the many reasons for decline in retirement security, which include rising health care costs, the need for long-term care, the fact that Americans nearing retirement have more debt than those of previous generations, and the simple fact that Americans are living longer. Another contributing factor is that employees of small businesses are much less likely to have the option of participation in employer-based retirement plans. Along with Senator Bill Nelson, Senator Collins has authored the \u201cRetirement Security Act,\u201d to reduce the cost and complexity of retirement plans, especially for small businesses, and to encourage individuals to save for their retirement. Rob Carmichael described Maine Savings FCU\u2019s efforts to help their employees prepare for retirement though a 401 (k) plan the company offers. \u201cWe see on a daily basis, the struggles our employees and members encounter as they try to make ends meet and deal with the day to day events of their lives\u2026.As with many Americans, some of our employees struggle with significant credit card debt, thereby reducing the disposable income available for investing in their retirement.\u201d Carmichael said that the company has seen success and a high participation rate with their plan, in which employees are automatically enrolled, with the option of opting out. He said that the regulatory environment is an impediment that prevents small businesses from offering retirement savings plans. Jean Chatzky said that, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances, a typical working family in the pre-retirement years has about $104,000 in retirement savings. For more than half, that will not be enough, even when combined with Social Security and pensions. Witnesses as well as Senator Collins discussed the fact that many seniors may be taking their Social Security benefits early, at age 62, without knowing the financial benefits of waiting until age 66 or 70. Taking benefits early, which results in a reduce monthly benefit for the rest of a beneficiary\u2019s life, is another factor leading to the fact that far too many Americans do not have enough financial resources to maintain their standard of living in retirement. Senator Collins urged the Social Security Administration to provide seniors with detailed information about the benefits of retiring later, when that option is available to them. Retirement security is among Senator Collins\u2019 top priorities as Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging."},

This legislation would create a separate benefit category under Medicare for the continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and would require coverage of the device for individuals meeting specified medical criteria. A CGM is a physician-prescribed, FDA-approved medical device that can provide real-time readings and data about trends in glucose levels every five minutes, thus enabling someone with insulin-dependent diabetes to eat or take insulin and prevent dangerously low or high glucose levels. Currently, however, insulin-dependent Medicare beneficiaries are being denied coverage for CGMs because the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that they do not meet the Medicare definition of durable medical equipment and do not fall under any other Medicare category. In her floor speech Senator Collins said, \u201cThe continuous glucose monitor is a potential life-saving device because it prevents dangerously low and high blood glucose levels by alarming the wearer when glucose levels fall outside of a safe range\u2026.Still, even though 95 percent of private insurers cover CGM technology, Medicare does not. There are thousands of seniors with type 1 diabetes who are denied access to the CGM technology that would keep them healthy and safe.\u201d Senator Collins is the founder and co-chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus.

{"title": "Beware Of Tax Scams", "date": ["Posted Fri, 03/20/2015 - 16:29"], "release": "With the tax filing season upon us, criminals posing as IRS officials are increasing their attempts to defraud taxpayers, with seniors a particular target. It is my hope that this column will provide seniors, as well as their families and caregivers, the information they need to avoid becoming a victim of these cruel scams. As Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I oversee the Committee\u2019s fraud hotline (toll-free, 1-855-303-9470), which has helped shed light on a number of these scams, particularly phone scams. During the past few weeks, the number of reports of fraudsters who call seniors pretending to be IRS officials has soared. Through this scam, of which there are multiple variations, criminals generally accuse the potential victim of owing back taxes and penalties (most often erroneously). They threaten retaliation, such as home foreclosure and even arrest, if immediate payment is not made by a certified check, credit card, or pre-paid debit card. In one recent scam, a senior and disabled veteran in Maine received a call from someone claiming to be a U.S. Department of Treasury official. The caller told the would-be victim that he owed $2,400 in back taxes and that if he did not immediately return the call of this Treasury \u201cofficial,\u201d he would be arrested. The scammer eventually provided instructions to the would-be victim that included withdrawing money from his account, or purchasing a pre-paid debit card to be turned over to the con artist. Fortunately, the would-be victim became suspicious of the situation and reported it to the Aging Committee Fraud Hotline. But this scam is prevalent, and the tactics are typical of many tax scams. In another case, a Maine woman recently reported that she had received a letter in the mail from \u201cSun Trust Financial Services\u201d in Long Beach, California, indicating that she had won $250,000 in an international sweepstakes. The letter included an enclosed check for $4,650 for \u201cprocessing fees.\u201d She was instructed to deposit the check at her bank and then to immediately mail a certified check for the same amount to the address on the letter. Had this individual fallen for the scam, she would have later learned that the enclosed check was fraudulent, the company was a hoax, and she would have lost $4,650. With such scams reaching epidemic proportions across the country, the IRS has released several tips to help taxpayers identify suspicious calls that may be part of a scam. \u2022 The IRS will never call a taxpayer to demand immediate payment, nor will the agency call about taxes owed without first having mailed a bill to the taxpayer. \u2022 The IRS will never demand that a taxpayer pay taxes without giving him or her the opportunity to question or appeal the amount claimed to be owed. \u2022 The IRS will never ask for a credit or debit card number over the phone. \u2022 The IRS will never threaten to send local police or other law enforcement to have a taxpayer arrested. \u2022 The IRS will never require a taxpayer to use a specific payment method for taxes, such as a prepaid debit card. Should you receive a suspicious call, here are some tips on what you should do. In addition to calling the Aging Committee Fraud Hotline, seniors can report potential instances of scams or fraud to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) at 1-800-366-4484 or at  . The IRS also advises that if you receive a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS and you believe that you may owe taxes, you should call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040. IRS workers can help taxpayers with payment issues. The IRS has also advised taxpayers that the agency does not use unsolicited email, text messages, or any social media to discuss personal tax issues. And here is something else seniors and all taxpayers can do if they suspect they are being targeted by a phone scam: simply hang up on the caller. Remember, the IRS will never call a taxpayer demanding immediate payment. Putting a stop to scams, such as these IRS phone scams, is among my highest priorities as Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee. The committee\u2019s investigations this year are building upon our important work of the last Congress. For example, through its hearings and investigations, the Aging Committee brought to light the \u201cJamaican lottery\u201d phone scam, which targeted seniors in Maine and throughout the Northeast. Through this scam, fraudsters contact a would-be victim and tell them that have won the Jamaican lottery, or a new car. Victims are directed to send a \u201cfee\u201d to process their winnings, and that their winnings will be sent to them once the processing fee is received. But of course, the \u201cwinnings\u201d never arrive and more demands for money follow. As a result of the Aging Committee\u2019s work, several arrests were made in connection with the Jamaican lottery scam. The Aging Committee also has investigated and brought to light the \u201cGrandparent Scam,\u201d where scam artists claim to be a victim\u2019s grandchild or other relative who is in trouble and in need of money. And the committee held a hearing on precious metal investment scams that also have targeted seniors. Unfortunately, phone scams by ruthless individuals who want to defraud seniors out of their hard-earned savings are all too abundant. Diligence and information are among our most valuable allies in confronting this growing problem. Please keep the Aging Committee Fraud Hotline toll-free number handy (1-855-303-9470), and don\u2019t hesitate to call if you think you may have been targeted by a scam."},
{"title": "Senator Collins Discusses Homeless Veterans, Choice Card, With VA Secretary McDonald", "date": ["Posted Fri, 03/20/2015 - 16:36"], "release": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 U.S. Senator Susan Collins met with Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert McDonald for an hour this morning to discuss issues important to Maine veterans, including homelessness and the 40-mile rule as it relates to the Veterans Choice Card program. Senator Collins approached Secretary McDonald about a proposed partnership between the VA in Maine and Volunteers of America (VOA) to provide housing for homeless veterans on a parcel of land at the Togus VA hospital campus. The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have set a goal of ending veteran homelessness by the end of this year. To achieve that goal, however, continued investments are needed to meet the needs of homeless veterans. \u201cRecently Veterans Service Organizations from Maine met with me to explore the opportunity for the Togus campus to provide housing for homeless veterans,\u201d Senator Collins said. \u201cSince that time, I have explored this concept with the HUD Secretary and today, with VA Secretary McDonald, who has designated a top member of his team to work on this issue.\u201d \u201cI explained to Secretary McDonald that nationally, according to HUD\u2019s \u2018Point in Time\u2019 survey, the number of homeless veterans is down 11.7 percent from 2013. In Maine, however, veterans\u2019 homelessness has declined by only 7.9 percent when compared to 2013. We need a more concerted effort to help ensure that those Mainers who served our country in uniform are not homeless,\u201d Senator Collins continued. The 2014 count indicates that there are 152 homeless veterans in Maine. Senator Collins noted that many questions remain about financing the project, but that she hopes the high level attention of the Cabinet Secretaries working with Maine veterans groups, Togus officials, the Maine State Housing Authority, VOA, and other potential partners will produce progress. In addition, Senator Collins stressed the challenges faced by Maine veterans regarding the 40-mile rule in the Veterans Choice Card program. Last month, Senator Collins led a bipartisan group of 40 of her colleagues in expressing concerns about the implementation of the Choice Program enacted by Congress last year. This program allows veterans who live more than 40 miles from the closest VA facility, or who face a significant delay in scheduling an appointment, to access health care at non-VA facilities. Rather than measure the actual distance that the veteran would have to travel, the VA interpreted the 40-mile requirement to mean \u201cas the crow flies.\u201d The eligibility criteria is interpreted so narrowly that it excludes many veterans who are far away from the care they need. \u201cI was encouraged by Secretary McDonald\u2019s assurances that he is reviewing the interpretation of the 40-mile requirement. I gave him examples of veterans in rural Maine who would have to drive twice that distance to access care at a VA facility, even though \u2018as the crow flies,\u2019 the distance is under 40 miles,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cI am hopeful that our veterans will soon see a change in the VA\u2019s policy.\u201d Senator Collins said that she also had the opportunity to discuss care for women veterans, mental health services to reduce suicides among veterans, the VA budget, and other issues with the Secretary."},
{"title": "Following Request From Collins, King, VA Secretary Announces Expansion Of Health Care For Veterans", "date": ["Posted Tue, 03/24/2015 - 13:30"], "release": "Washington, D.C. \u2013 Following a push from U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced today that it will make a critical change in the way eligibility is determined for the Veterans Choice Card Program. Specifically, this change will adjust the way the distance requirement is calculated under the 40-mile rule, roughly doubling the number of eligible veterans nationwide who can receive care in their communities. In a joint statement, Senators Collins and King said, \u201cRegardless of where they live, our veterans deserve access to quality health care. We are pleased to hear that Secretary McDonald has listened to veterans\u2019 concerns and will adopt a common-sense interpretation of the 40-mile rule and implement the provision the way that Congress had intended. Today\u2019s announcement removes a significant roadblock and the program will take an important step forward to expand health care accessibility.\u201d The Choice Program is a three-year pilot program established by Congress in direct response to the nationwide crisis of access to care. The program allows veterans who live more than 40-miles from the closest VA facility, face significant burdens of travel, or are unable to schedule an appointment within 30 days to access non-VA care in their community. The VA interpreted the 40-mile requirement to mean \u201cas the crow flies,\u201d or a straight line distance, rather than measuring the actual distance that the veteran would have to travel. This narrow definition had excluded from the program many veterans that Congress intended to help. In response to congressional pressure led by Senators Collins and King, the VA announced that it will no longer use the straight line distance in its calculations and will instead use driving distance to determine eligibility. Last month,  , led by Senator Collins and joined by Senator King, urged Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald to use his existing authority to change immediately the way that the distance criterion is calculated. In addition, Senators Collins and King joined Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) in  legislation that would correct by force of law the VA\u2019s flawed interpretation of the 40-mile rule. This bill also clarifies that the distance measured must be to a VA facility that offers the precise health care services the veteran requires. Senators Collins and King continued, \u201cWhile today\u2019s announcement from the VA shows important progress, our work is not finished yet. We must make certain that those who served do not face undue burdens in accessing the care support services they have earned. At present, the VA still does not consider the type of care available within 40 miles of where a veteran lives. Across the nation, many veterans require specific services that are not offered at a VA hospital within a 40 mile radius, but they are still prevented for accessing this specialty care at a non-VA hospital in their local community.\u201d"},

This amendment creates a deficit neutral reserve fund to support the Federal Pell Grant Program and help students fulfill their dreams of a higher education.

When I worked at Husson University in Bangor, I saw first-hand the impact Pell Grants had for many of our students and their families,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cNow, I have two talented women on my staff whose education and subsequent success was made possible by Pell Grants. With this amendment, Congress is closer to ensuring that the unprecedented success of this program can continue for future students.\u201d Senator Collins has been a longtime advocate for Pell Grants and has consistently supported efforts to help make higher education more accessible. In fact, one of the first bills Senator Collins introduced when she joined the Senate was the College Affordability and Access Act. The Pell Grant program is one of the most successful need-based aid programs, assisting more than 8 million full- and part-time college and vocational school students last year."},
{"title": "Ending Alzheimer\u2019s\u2014Supporting The Search For A Cure", "date": ["Posted Fri, 03/27/2015 - 14:50"], "release": "Barbara Smith, also known as \u201cB.,\u201d is a well-known restauranteur, author and supermodel who was the first African-American to be featured on the cover of Mademoiselle magazine. In her own words, she now has the \u201cmost important job of all,\u201d which is to make a difference in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In very moving and emotional testimony, Ms. Smith recently described her struggles with the disease before the Senate Aging Committee, which I chair. Sadly, Ms. Smith has been diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease and is determined to raise public awareness to help others. Right by her side in this fight is her husband Dan Gasby, who says the disease has taken away a person who was at the peak of her abilities. They are determined to make something positive come from their personal struggle with this terrible disease. Alzheimer\u2019s is a devastating disease that takes a tremendous personal and economic toll on the individual, the family, and our nation. Today, more than 5 million Americans, are living with the disease that has no effective means of prevention, treatment, or a cure. Alzheimer\u2019s is now the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S. In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer\u2019s costs the United States an estimated $226 billion per year, including $153 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid. These costs will only skyrocket as the baby boom generation ages. Unless an effective treatment is developed before 2050, the costs will soar to more than $1.1 trillion, according to new estimates of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. Far too many families have experienced the pain of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. As a Senator representing the State with the oldest median age, Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, and Senate Co-Chair of the Congressional Alzheimer\u2019s Task Force, I am convinced that we must accelerate research to find a way to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Doing so is among my highest legislative priorities. That is why I authored a bipartisan amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution that calls for an increase in our federal investment in Alzheimer\u2019s research. I have also been joined by my colleague, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) in introducing a resolution declaring that that the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer\u2019s by 2025 is an \u201curgent national priority,\u201d as recommended in the National Plan to Address Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. The bipartisan resolution calls on the Senate to double the amount of funding the United States spends on Alzheimer\u2019s in fiscal year 2016 and develop a plan to meet the target of $2 billion, as recommended by experts, over the next five years. According to Alzheimer\u2019s Association, if the federal government were to invest this amount, it would recoup its investment within the first three years a treatment or means of prevention becomes available. It is now estimated that nearly one in two of the baby boomers reaching age 85 will develop Alzheimer\u2019s. As a consequence, chances are that members of the baby boom generation will either be spending their golden years with Alzheimer\u2019s or caring for someone who has it. If we are to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s from becoming the defining disease of the next generation, it is past time that we dramatically increase our investment in Alzheimer\u2019s research. When the United States is spending more than $200 billion a year to care for Alzheimer\u2019s patients, it is troubling that we are spending less than three-tenths of one percent of that amount B less than $600 million a year B on research. We currently spend $4.5 billion a year for cancer research, $3 billion a year for research on HIV/AIDS, and $2 billion for cardiovascular research-- all investments that have paid great dividends. Surely, we can do more for Alzheimer\u2019s given the tremendous human and economic price of this devastating disease. Sadly, there are 500,000 deaths each year that are attributed to Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias. This disease also takes a terrible toll on family caregivers. It is estimated that in Maine, these caregivers provide 77,000 hours of unpaid care to their loved ones. It is essential that a national Alzheimer\u2019s plan includes vigorous support for the families of those with the disease. The endless series of exhausting \u201c36 hour\u201d days inflicts serious emotional and physical hardship on family caregivers. This disease takes a particularly difficult toll on women since almost two-thirds of Americans living with Alzheimer\u2019s are women, and women are also more likely to be the family caregiver. I called the recent Aging Committee hearing to assess our progress in combating Alzheimer\u2019s. Among our witnesses was Dr. Heidi Wierman, Division Director of Geriatrics at the Maine Medical Center in Portland. Dr. Wierman told the Committee that dementia \u201cis a looming crisis for our state and the nation, with Alzheimer\u2019s being the most common.\u201d She said that diagnosis and treatment of patients with dementia is often not a part of clinical training for most health care providers. It is critical, she said, that our primary care system become better prepared to deal with cognitive assessment and care planning for dementia patients. That, too, must be among our national priorities. Fortunately, promising research holds hope for Alzheimer\u2019s patients and their families. The research community is poised to make important advances through clinical trials and investigating new therapeutic targets, but adequate funding is critical to advance this research. As I presided over the recent hearing, I looked onto a standing-room-only hearing room that was filled with hundreds of Alzheimer\u2019s advocates from throughout the nation, including many from Maine, who wore the color purple to show their support for Alzheimer\u2019s research, the patients, and their families. I hope that someday the color purple will be worn by Alzheimer\u2019s survivors."},

The program allows veterans who live more than 40 miles from the closest VA facility, or who face a significant delay in scheduling an appointment, to access non-VA care. \u201cThe VA is construing the eligibility criteria as it relates to the 40-mile rule so narrowly that it is excluding too many who are far away from the care that they need,\u201d wrote the Senators.

The Honorable Robert McDonald Secretary of Veterans Affairs U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 810 Vermont Avenue Washington, D.C. 20420 Dear Secretary McDonald: Since November 1, 2014, the Choice Card, as provided under the recently enacted Veterans Choice, Access, and Accountability Act of 2014, has been distributed to approximately 8.5 million Veterans nationwide, yet less than one percent of recipients \u2013 0.37 percent \u2013 have been authorized to access non-VA care through this program. With this in mind, we write to convey serious concerns regarding your implementation of the Choice Card Program with respect to funding for the program in connection with the Fiscal Year 2016 Presidential Budget Request and your interpretation of the 40-mile rule as provided under the Act. We ask you to address both of these concerns immediately. First, we were dismayed to learn from the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Request that the Department of Veterans Affairs intends to submit a legislative proposal that would reallocate part of the funding for the Veterans Choice Program to other programs within the VA. It is deeply disturbing that the Administration would try to reduce funding for this program before this program has even been allowed to work \u2013 being in existence for only a few short months \u2013 and as barriers to care continue to exist. Instead, the Department should make certain that funding provided by Congress is being used to implement the Veterans Choice Program to the fullest extent possible. Second, the VA is construing the eligibility criteria as it relates to the 40-mile rule so narrowly that it is excluding too many who are far away from the care that they need. As you know, the Choice Program provides Veterans with the option to receive non-VA health care rather than waiting for a VA appointment if there is a significant delay in scheduling an appointment or a Veteran has to travel more than 40 miles to receive VA care. While many Veterans are satisfied with care provided through the VA Health Care System, trips to VA medical centers can be difficult for rural Veterans, especially those who are elderly or ill. Because long drive times are a hardship for these individuals and can present a significant barrier to accessing care, many Veterans anticipated using their Choice Cards when Congress established the Choice Program last year. The VA\u2019s definition of the eligibility criteria is too narrow in two important respects. First, the VA does not consider the type of care available within 40 miles of where a Veteran lives. In many areas across the nation, the effect is that those who need services only available at a VA medical center, but who live near a Community-Based Outpatient Clinic, are prevented from using the Choice Card to access specialty care in their local community. While the Clinic may be within 40 miles, the VA hospital offering the required care is often more than 40 miles and hours of travel time away. Second, the VA measures the 40 miles \u201cas the crow flies\u201d and not the actual distance that the Veteran would have to travel. Congress\u2019 intent was to establish a pilot program that would allow Veterans to access non-VA care when they face an obstacle to care, whether it be an unacceptable distance to care or wait time for care. Given the clear intent of Congress to reduce barriers to care, it is perplexing that the VA is not using its authority to allow non-VA care for those who face a geographic challenge in accessing care, including long drive times or health conditions that make travel difficult. The impact of such an interpretation is to exclude from the program many of the Veterans for whom Congress aimed to make health care more accessible. For Veterans in remote and rural areas with limited transportation access, this could mean the difference between 30 minutes and half a day of travel. As Secretary, you already have the authority to modify the way that the distance criteria is calculated so that the Choice Program is implemented as Congress intended, and we urge you to rectify the overly narrow definition without delay. Additionally, we urge you to stop any attempt to propose a reallocation of funds designed to kill the Choice Card program in its infancy."},
{"title": "\"Oversight \u2013 An Essential Ingredient For Good Government\"", "date": ["Posted Fri, 02/06/2015 - 14:51"], "release": "As a native of Aroostook County, I know how important the Maine potato industry is to the families and communities it sustains. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I am committed to ensuring that federal food policies recognize the value of this affordable and highly nutritious vegetable. In recent years, unfortunately, the white potato has been under an unwarranted attack by the U.S. Department of Agriculture based on flawed science and outdated consumption data. Four years ago, I led the fight to overturn a misguided USDA rule that would have strictly limited servings of white potatoes in the National School Lunch Program, and would have banned potatoes altogether from the National School Breakfast Program. With the help of Maine food scientists, school nutrition experts, and farmers, we successfully prevented this arbitrary limitation. Building on that victory, I have been working to end the needless exclusion of fresh white potatoes from the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, food program. WIC is an invaluable supplemental food program designed to meet the special nutritional needs of low-income pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and children up to five years of age who are at nutritional risk. Inexpensive and packed with vital nutrients, the white potato is a perfect fit for WIC. The recently enacted 2015 federal funding bill includes my provision that the Senate expects USDA to change its arbitrary decision to exclude the fresh white potato from the WIC program, the only fresh vegetable to be excluded. My provision also specifies that vegetables with added sugars, fats, or oils cannot be purchased using WIC vouchers. In addition, USDA is required to review the entire WIC food package, including an evaluation of the nutrient value of all vegetables, to determine the long-term inclusion or exclusion of any fresh fruit or vegetable. Our cause received a major boost early this month with a report by the Institutes of Medicine recommending that USDA allow fresh, white potatoes to be eligible for purchase under the WIC program, consistent with the most current 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendations. The independent, nonprofit Institutes of Medicine is the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences. The USDA\u2019s decision ought to be driven by nutritional facts and the latest, accurate food science. In that kind of review, the fresh, white potato wins, hands down. The potato has more potassium than bananas, a food commonly associated with this nutrient, which is important for pregnant women and new mothers. Potatoes are cholesterol-free, fat-free, and sodium-free, and can be served in countless healthy ways. A medium baked potato contains 15 percent of the daily recommended value of dietary fiber, 27 percent of the daily recommended value for vitamin B6, and 28 percent of the daily recommended value of Vitamin C. The Institutes of Medicine review states that increased consumption of fresh, white potatoes could improve potassium intake for both women and children. It concludes with the recommendation that USDA allow white potatoes as a WIC-eligible vegetable. The USDA\u2019s ill-advised assault on the white potato seems to be driven by concern that children eat too many French fries and potato chips. I agree, but there are so many other ways to prepare this excellent vegetable \u2013 baked, boiled, roasted, in soups, chowders, and stews, to name but a few. For example, Maine school food service administrators tell me that many kids rave for baked potato bars where they can top potatoes with broccoli, shaved carrots, beans, chives, vegetarian chili, and salsa. Instead of prohibiting the purchase of the fresh potato, USDA should encourage its healthy preparation as it can help improve the nutrient intake and diet quality of WIC participants. One of my first jobs growing up in Caribou was picking potatoes for a local farmer. That is hard work. In Washington, I will continue to work hard for an industry that does so much for the economy of our State and for the good nutrition of all Americans."},

The effort is co-sponsored by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Patty Murray (D-WA) and companion legislation will be introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Susan Davis (D-CA) later today. \u201cThere is no place for discrimination in our judicial system,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cI am proud to join Senator Shaheen in working to make sure no one is prohibited from fulfilling his or her fundamental right and obligation to serve on a jury based on his or her sexual identity.\u201d \u201cDiscrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity has no place in our country,\u201d Senator Shaheen said. \u201cEvery citizen has the right and responsibility to sit on a jury and participate in the judicial process, and the jury selection process should represent our country\u2019s values of inclusion and acceptance.\u201d \u201cServing on a jury is one of America\u2019s most cherished civic duties,\u201d said Congresswoman Davis. \u201cIt is unjust to exclude a particular group of people from participating in civil society because of whom they love. The federal government already prohibits juror discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, and economic status. As we pursue greater equality for all Americans, LGBT Americans should also be free from juror discrimination.\u201d The United States Code currently prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin and economic status. However, there is no federal prohibition on discriminating against jurors based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The Jury ACCESS Act would amend the federal statute to include \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity,\u201d meaning that striking jurors on that basis would be prohibited in federal courts. Last year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to reconsider its earlier holding that it is unconstitutional for a juror to be excluded on the basis of sexual orientation and that sexual orientation warrants the same strong legal protections in jury selection as other categories, such as sex and race. The 9th Circuit Court\u2019s decision to not take up the issue again supports the concept behind Collins, Shaheen, and Davis\u2019 legislation, however the Jury ACCESS Act is still necessary to codify the 9th Circuit\u2019s ruling nationally."},

{"title": "Broken Trust: The Financial Exploitation Of Seniors", "date": ["Posted Fri, 02/13/2015 - 14:18"], "release": "In late 2012, a Maine jury found an Androscoggin County woman guilty of stealing from her own mother. The details leading up to this conviction were very troubling: This woman sold her mother\u2019s home and moved her into a camper located in her backyard. As if that were not bad enough, the daughter and her boyfriend went on to deplete her mother\u2019s life savings over the course of two years, leaving her penniless as well as homeless. In another troubling case, an 82-year old World War II veteran living in Cumberland County had his daughter living with him to help with his care after he suffered two strokes. By the time he had suspected that his daughter had misused his money and he contacted an attorney, his daughter had taken ownership of his home and depleted his savings account from more than $20,000 to $15. She created further financial problems by taking out a personal car loan, using him as a co-signer. Financial exploitation of older Americans is a growing epidemic that cost seniors an estimated $2.9 billion in 2010, according to the GAO. In Maine alone, there are 14,000 new reports each year of senior abuse, which includes financial abuse. And, in as many as 90 percent of financial cases, the senior is victimized by someone he or she knows well. The Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, recently held a hearing to examine financial exploitation that harms far too many of our nation\u2019s most vulnerable seniors. The Committee has brought to light many schemes that have defrauded seniors out of their hard-earned retirement savings. It is deeply troubling when a senior falls victim to one of these schemes. But even more egregious is when the perpetrator is a family member, caregiver, or trusted financial advisor. Unfortunately, the full story is even worse. Many of these cases are never reported because the victim is too ashamed to report financial exploitation, particularly when it involves a family member. As a consequence, the true incidence of this kind of abuse is not known. Identifying victims of financial exploitation in my state is particularly difficult because we Mainers pride ourselves on our self-sufficiency. It is difficult for many seniors to ask for help. In addition, since victims who have their assets taken by family members typically do not want their relatives to be criminally prosecuted, the stolen money is rarely recovered. This loss can undermine both the health of older adults and their financial security. Combating financial abuse of seniors is primarily the responsibility of state and local agencies, particularly Adult Protective Services Agencies, but the federal government also plays an important role. Experts agree that prevention and response to these cases of abuse requires coordinated efforts, which include federal, state and local agencies, law enforcement, the social work and medical community, and financial institutions. The Elder Justice Coordinating Council, which is led by the Department of Health and Human Services, has brought together 12 federal agencies to coordinate efforts to protect older individuals from abuse, including financial exploitation. I was pleased that Judith Shaw, who serves as the Securities Administrator for the State of Maine, came to Washington to appear as a witness during this hearing. Judith had a great deal to share with members of the Aging Committee because Maine is on the cutting edge of helping to combat financial abuse of seniors though programs like the innovative Senior$afe program, which is the first of its kind in the nation. Senior$afe is a collaborative effort by Maine\u2019s regulators, financial institutions, and legal organizations to educate bank and credit union employees about how to identify and help stop financial exploitation of older Mainers. Senior$afe has also published a brochure that provides useful tips to help seniors from becoming victim to financial exploitation and scams. For example: \u2022 Seniors are advised to monitor their credit reports at least annually by visiting   or by calling 1-877-322-8228; \u2022 Use caution when utilizing joint accounts as a method of planning for incapacity or getting help paying bills. Both parties are equal owners and have equal access. Seniors are advised to talk to their financial institutions, an attorney or local Area Agency on Aging to learn about options for assistance with finances. \u2022 Never convey or quitclaim an interest in real estate without consulting an attorney. To be clear, financial exploitation knows no socio-economic boundaries. Victims range from seniors who have very modest financial means to those who have amassed great wealth. While individuals of limited means are particularly vulnerable, even the wealthiest Americans are not immune to financial exploitation. During our recent hearing, the Aging Committee also heard from Philip Marshall, who is the grandson of well-known philanthropist Brooke Astor, who summered in Maine for decades. He described how his father, Anthony Marshall, mistreated his mother and mismanaged her assets while she suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. There are many instances when it is vital for a senior to have the assistance of a family member, friend, or other trusted financial advisor to help manage his or her finances wisely and prudently, particularly if that senior becomes ill or loses some cognitive ability. This is another factor that makes this issue so troubling and complicated. Through my work on the Aging Committee, I will continue to explore ways to fight financial exploitation and other scams targeted at seniors. Financial exploitation is truly a \u201cbroken trust\u201d that harms far too many of our nation\u2019s vulnerable population."},

For example, the town of Eastport has endured more than eight feet of snow since January 24, and more is predicted for this week. These back-to-back storms and accompanying single-digit and subzero temperatures have required extraordinary measures to clear roads, streets, and bridges, and to provide basic services to residents, particularly in many of the towns in the eastern part of the county. The storms have also severely taxed already stretched municipal snow removal budgets, equipment, and personnel. While we recognize that the threshold for snow removal assistance is usually measured by individual storm, we urge you to take into consideration the cumulative amount of snow that has fallen in Washington County over the past month. According to the National Weather Service in Caribou, Maine, the amount of snow that has fallen in eastern Washington County over the past three weeks is \u201cunparalleled\u201d in the past 100 years or so. Cleaning up after a series of storms that result in many feet of snow is more burdensome, difficult, and expensive than dealing with just one or two \u201csuper snowstorms.\u201d There are roads in the town of Lubec that still have only one lane accessible because it is just too difficult for crews to keep pace with the endless storms and enormous snowbanks. We appreciate your prompt attention to our request and ask that you give it every appropriate consideration.

{"title": "Helping Small Businesses Brew Jobs And Economic Growth", "date": ["Posted Fri, 02/20/2015 - 12:02"], "release": "As I travel throughout Maine, I am consistently impressed by the energy, imagination, and commitment of our small business community. From technology to the arts, Maine entrepreneurs are strengthening our economy and creating good jobs for the people of our State. One of the exciting small-business growth sectors in Maine is craft brewing. Our State is now home to more than 60 breweries that produce more than 200 different varieties. Maine craft breweries employ more than 1,400 people in jobs that will stay right here in Maine, jobs are not going to be outsourced. These are small businesses in our communities that are hiring people and making a difference. Maine beer is shipped around the country and, increasingly, overseas. It has developed a real following among connoisseurs who have come to appreciate Maine quality and craftsmanship. This, in turn, has led to new tourism opportunities as visitors are drawn to our State to sample our delicious craft beers. The rise of craft brewing is not just a Maine phenomenon. Nationally, small and independent brewers employ more than 110,000 full and part-time employees, generating more than $3 billion in wages and benefits, and pay more than $2.3 billion in business, personal, and consumption taxes. Craft beer now captures about 12 percent of the total U.S. beer market, double the market share of just five years earlier. Congress can help create an environment that encourages job creation. That is why I have introduced, along with Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland, the Small Brewer Reinvestment and Expanding Workforce Act, or Small BREW Act. My Maine colleague, Senator Angus King, is an original co-sponsor of our bipartisan legislation. The bill\u2019s title is more than just a clever acronym; it is a statement of what this legislation is all about. The Small BREW Act is a jobs bill, and those covered by the bill are small businesses, entrepreneurs who are taking risks and creating jobs in communities around our state and around the country. Our bill offers a practical means to spur the creation of new jobs as well as great products in this growing industry by reducing the federal excise tax on small craft brewers. This reduction would free up capital so these small business owners can reinvest in their companies and create more jobs. Under the current law, these small businesses pay $7 per barrel in federal excise tax on the first 60,000 barrels they brew and $18 per barrel on every barrel thereafter. The Small BREW Act would reduce these rates to $3.50 on the first 60,000 barrels and $16 for production between 60,000 and 2 million barrels. Thereafter, the rate would remain at $18 per barrel. We know from an economic analysis that such a change would have a significant positive economic impact. A 2013 study by a professor then at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government estimated that our bill would increase economic activity by $1 billion over 5 years, create more than 5,000 new jobs in the first year to 18 months after passage, and create approximately 400 new jobs annually thereafter. This change is long overdue. The small brewer threshold and tax rate were established in 1976 and have never been updated. Since then, the largest multinational producer of beer has increased its annual production from 45 million barrels to 97 million barrels domestically and 325 million barrels globally. Raising the ceiling that defines small breweries from 2 million barrels to 6 million barrels more accurately reflects the intent of the original differentiation between large and small brewers in the U.S. Because of differences in economies of scale, small brewers have higher costs for raw materials, production, packaging, and market entry compared to larger, well-established multinational competitors. Adjusting the excise tax rate would provide small brewers with an additional $65-$70 million each year they could use to start or expand their businesses on a local, regional, or national scale. As the craft beer industry grows, so too will demand for American-grown barley and hops, and American-made brewing, bottling, canning, and other equipment. In fact, I recently visited a family farm in Aroostook that is beginning to malt barley for the craft breweries throughout our State. In meeting with brewers across Maine, they always make clear to me how federal tax policy affects their businesses. The Small BREW Act would help reduce the tax burden placed on many small brewers across our country, allowing them \u2013 along with farmers and equipment manufacturers -- to thrive, create jobs, and further grow our economy."},

I am concerned that the current, arbitrary caps could prevent Medicare beneficiaries recovering from a stroke, hip fracture, or other diseases or conditions requiring extensive therapy from receiving all of the services they need. In addition, Medicare patients would have an incentive to seek services in the hospital outpatients setting, which are not subject to the caps and are more expensive. Arbitrarily capping these vital rehabilitation services would cause some beneficiaries to delay necessary care, force others to assume higher out-of-pocket costs, and disrupt the continuum of care for many seniors and persons with disabilities.\u201d \u201cWe need a full repeal of the existing caps on physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. These annual financial caps limit services often needed after a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or spinal cord injury, or to effectively manage conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, and arthritis. Arbitrary caps on these vital Medicare outpatient therapy services are simply unacceptable,\u201d said Senator Cardin, a member of the Finance Health Care Subcommittee. \u201cWe should be helping seniors receive services necessary to resume their normal lives, not erecting road blocks to recovery. Year after year, Congress has shown its disapproval for these arbitrary therapy caps.\u201d Limits on outpatient rehabilitation therapy services under Medicare were first imposed in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget Act. The decision to impose limits on these services was not based on data, quality-of-care concerns, or clinical judgment\u2014its sole purpose was to limit spending in order to balance the federal budget. Since 1997, Congress has acted over 12 times to prevent the implementation of the therapy caps through moratoriums and an exceptions process. While these short-term actions have provided necessary relief to our seniors, a long-term solution is essential to bring permanent relief and much-needed stability for both patients and providers. In a 2009 report issued by the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MEDPAC), it was estimated that the therapy cap, if enforced without an exceptions process, could negatively impact 931,000 Medicare beneficiaries. Arbitrarily capping outpatient rehabilitation therapy services would likely cause some beneficiaries to delay necessary care, force others to assume higher out-of pocket costs, and disrupt the continuum of care for many seniors and individuals with disabilities. The Medicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act is supported by a broad coalition of organizations representing the interests of patients, consumers and health care providers."},
{"title": "Senator Collins Questions Secretary Pritzker, Maine Delegation Responds To Coalition For Fair Paper Imports' Petition", "date": ["Posted Thu, 02/26/2015 - 17:27"], "release": "Washington, D.C. \u2013 In a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing today, Senator Susan Collins questioned Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker regarding the ongoing, unfair subsidies received by the Port Hawkesbury paper mill in Canada. In response to Senator Collins\u2019 questions, Secretary Pritzker reaffirmed her commitment to enforcing international trade obligations and committed to keeping the Maine delegation updated about their investigations into the matter.  It was also announced today that the Coalition for Fair Paper Imports \u2013 including Madison Paper Industries and Verso Corporations \u2013 filed a petition alleging that Canadian supercalendered paper producers are benefitting from subsidies by the Canadian government. Earlier this month, Madison Paper Industries temporarily laid of employees for two weeks citing, in part, competition from subsidized supercalendered paper. In response to news of the Coalition for Fair Paper Imports\u2019 petition, Senator Collins, Senator Angus King, and Congressman Bruce Poliquin said, \u201cWe will continue to urge the United States Department of Commerce to do everything within their power to help put an end to these unfair subsidies and protect our Maine jobs. These unfair trade practices are hurting our paper mills and leaving the lives of their hardworking employees and Maine families in uncertainty.\u201d In January, Senators Collins, King, and Congressman Poliquin wrote to Secretary Pritzker regarding the harm that these subsidies were causing for Maine workers, their families, and their communities. In her response, Secretary Pritzker said that the Department of Commerce would use the tools at its disposal to hold trading partners accountable. The January letter followed other congressional efforts to ensure that the U.S. government examine these harmful subsidies. In December 2012, Senator Collins led a bipartisan letter to then-U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk urging the Administration to examine these potentially illegal subsidies and, in February 2013, Senator King also directed a letter to Ambassador Kirk expressing his concern about the subsidies. A copy of the 2012 response to Senator Collins\u2019 letter can be viewed here."},

The conversation followed a  by Maine Senators Collins and King last week. Administrator Fugate has agreed to reconsider the policy. \u201cThese extreme and successive storms have crippled many of the towns in the eastern part of Washington County where municipal resources are stretched thin,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cI am encouraged by my positive conversation with Administrator Fugate and will continue to push for the assistance that is so greatly needed.\u201d In determining whether to provide assistance, FEMA generally considers only the snowfall from a single storm rather than the cumulative total. According to the national weather service in Caribou, Maine, the amount of snow that has fallen in eastern Washington County over the past several weeks is \u201cunparalleled\u201d in the past 100 years or so. Cleaning up after a series of storms that result in many feet of snow is more burdensome, difficult, and expensive than dealing with just one or two \u201csuper snowstorms.\u201d"},
{"title": "Improving Access To Health Care For Rural Veterans", "date": ["Posted Fri, 02/27/2015 - 16:34"], "release": "Increased access to health care for our veterans, especially those in rural areas, must be among our nation\u2019s priorities. The men and women who have served America deserve no less, regardless of where in America they live. We have made significant progress, and Maine has led the way. Twenty-eight years ago, Caribou was the proving ground upon which the Department of Veterans Affairs has built a nationwide system of Community-Based Outpatient Clinics to provide primary care close to home. More recently, Northern Maine was selected by the VA as one of five pilot sites for the Access Received Closer to Home, or ARCH, program. The program allows veterans to seek VA-covered services through providers outside of the VA network if they have to wait more than two weeks for an appointment or if travel to a VA center would be too long, burdensome, or detrimental to their health. Congress took another important step forward last year by passing legislation to create the Veterans Choice program. Established in response to the nationwide crisis of veterans\u2019 access to care and building on the success of ARCH, this program allows veterans who live more than 40 miles from the closest VA facility, or who face a significant delay in scheduling an appointment, to access non-VA care. Unfortunately, the VA has yet to implement Veterans Choice as it was envisioned by Congress. Since November 1, 2014, the Choice Card, which enables veterans to obtain care outside of a VA facility if the distance and time criteria are met, has been distributed to approximately 8.5 million veterans nationwide, yet far less than one percent of card recipients \u2013 0.37 percent \u2013 have been authorized to access non-VA care through this program. This extremely low approval rate is occurring because the VA is interpreting the 40-mile rule so narrowly that it is excluding many veterans who are far away from the care that they need. The VA\u2019s definition of the eligibility criteria is too narrow in two important respects. First, the VA does not consider the type of care available within 40 miles of where a veteran lives. In many areas across the nation, the effect is that those who need services only available at a VA medical center, such as Togus, but who live near a Community-Based Outpatient Clinic, are prevented from using the Choice Card to access specialty care in their local community. While the Clinic may be within 40 miles, the VA hospital offering the required care is often much farther and many hours of travel time away. Second, the VA measures the 40 miles \u201cas the crow flies\u201d and not the actual distance that the veteran would have to travel. That is an unrealistic, even absurd, interpretation of a key provision of our legislation. Congress\u2019 intent was to establish a program that would allow veterans to access non-VA care when they face an obstacle to care. It is unacceptable for VA to be creating new obstacles with an interpretation of the law that defies common sense. It also is dismaying that, according to the President\u2019s 2016 Budget Request, the VA intends to submit a legislative proposal that would reallocate part of the funding for the Veterans Choice Program to other programs within the VA. It is deeply disturbing that the Administration would try to reduce funding for this program before it has even been allowed to work \u2013 being in existence for only a few short months \u2013 and as barriers to care continue to exist. The VA should make certain that funding provided by Congress is being used to implement the Veterans Choice Program to the fullest extent possible. I recently led a bipartisan group of my Senate colleagues in urging Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald to use his authority to change immediately the way that the distance criterion is calculated so that the Choice Program is implemented as Congress intended. We also called upon the Secretary to stop any attempt to propose a reallocation of funds designed to kill the Choice Card program in its infancy. In addition, Senator Angus King and I have introduced bipartisan legislation that would correct by force of law the VA\u2019s flawed interpretation by stipulating that the 40-mile rule must be based upon driving distance. Our bill also makes clear that the distance measured must be to a VA facility that offers the precise health care services the veteran requires. Maine veterans often face barriers to accessing care, including long drives in dangerous winter weather. The VA should have implemented the Choice Program as Congress intended, which was to allow veterans to seek care within their local communities if the VA cannot provide the services they need within 40 miles. Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country. We owe them all that we can do to ensure they receive the best care possible as conveniently as possible."},

{"title": " Collins Urges Rejection Of Plan To Make Saving For College More Difficult", "date": ["Posted Tue, 01/27/2015 - 18:00"], "release": "Washington, D.C. \u2013 In a speech on the Senate floor today, and in a letter sent to leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, U.S. Senator Susan Collins urges rejection of President Obama\u2019s proposal to alter the 529 College Savings Plan.\u00a0 Senator Collins says the President\u2019s plan to begin taxing the earnings of 529 College Savings Plan accounts would, instead, make it more difficult for hardworking parents to save and plan for their children\u2019s education. The 529 College Savings Plan allows parents to make contributions to a tax-advantaged account with after-tax dollars from their paychecks. These contributions grow over time and have an enormous impact on what parents are able to save to help their children pursue an education. Changing the tax rules not only breaks a promise to parents who are working hard to provide opportunities for their children, but it also increases the burden of debt a student will face at a time when rising student loan debt is a national concern. In her letter and in her speech on the Senate floor, Senator Collins said, \u201cRather than help American families meet the onerous cost of a college education, this new tax would greatly diminish the benefits of a law that is helping millions of parents plan for their children\u2019s futures.\u00a0 The President\u2019s proposal undermines the very values that we should be promoting \u2013 families making sacrifices today in order to better provide for their children tomorrow.\u201d .

That is why I am perplexed at the President\u2019s proposal to tax the earnings of 529 College Savings Plan accounts. Rather than help American families meet the onerous cost of a college education, this new tax would greatly diminish the benefits of a law that is helping millions of parents plan for their children\u2019s futures.\u00a0 The President\u2019s proposal undermines the very values that we should be promoting \u2013 families making sacrifices today in order to better provide for their children tomorrow. The President\u2019s plan would also lead to more student loan debt for many young people at a time when rising debt is a major concern. One of the first questions new parents ask themselves is how will they be able to pay for their child\u2019s college education.\u00a0 For the past 14 years, 529 accounts have been an important part of the answer, allowing parents to save for their children\u2019s education in tax-advantaged accounts.\u00a0 Regular, affordable contributions, made with after-tax dollars from their paychecks, grow over time.\u00a0 When the college years start, those savings, and the earnings from their investment, can be withdrawn tax-free for education expenses.\u00a0 The small sacrifices made from payday to payday can have an enormous impact, making real the dream of higher education. Parents also know that receiving a college degree greatly improves their child\u2019s future earnings potential. According to data compiled by the United States Census Bureau in 2011, individuals with college degrees earn approximately $1 million more over the course of their careers than do workers with high school diplomas.\u00a0 Census data also show that people with higher levels of education are more likely to be employed full-time, year-round.\u00a0 College graduates also tend to have access to more specialized jobs that, in turn, yield higher wages. Data from the College Savings Foundation show that the average value of a 529 account is $19,774, countering the assertion that 529 plans disproportionately benefit very high-income families.\u00a0 Additionally, the average regular electronic contribution, such as that from paycheck withholding, is just $175 per month.\u00a0 That is clearly more in line with hard-working families trying to make ends meet than with affluent families who enjoy significant disposable income. My home state provides a great example of the benefits of 529 plans.\u00a0 Thousands of Maine families established these accounts after the law was changed in 2001 to allow tax-free withdrawals for college expenses.\u00a0 In 2008, the Harold Alfond Foundation, which was established by one of Maine\u2019s greatest philanthropists, created the Alfond College Challenge. Today, this program provides a $500 contribution to the college savings account of every baby born in Maine.\u00a0 To date, some 23,000 Maine families have used this generous gift to begin planning for the future education of their children. All told, 38,000 Maine residents now have 529 College Savings Plan accounts, with combined assets of $160 million. Nationally, nearly 12 million Americans have 529 College Savings Plan accounts, with combined assets of $244 billion. The 529 College Savings Plan program channels the virtue of saving into the tangible benefit of helping hard-working middle-income American families save for their children\u2019s college education.\u00a0\u00a0 Changing the tax rules for 529 accounts would break a promise to these families.\u00a0 I urge you to reject the President\u2019s proposal and to save the 529 College Savings Plan program. ###"},

According to data compiled by the United States Census Bureau in 2011, individuals with college degrees earn approximately $1 million more over the course of their careers than do workers with high school diplomas.\u00a0 Census data also show that people with higher levels of education are more likely to be employed full-time, year-round.\u00a0 College graduates also tend to have access to more specialized jobs that, in turn, yield higher wages. Data from the College Savings Foundation show that the average value of a 529 account is $19,774, countering the assertion that 529 plans disproportionately benefit very high-income families.\u00a0 Additionally, the average regular electronic contribution, such as that from paycheck withholding, is just $175 per month.\u00a0 That is clearly more in line with hard-working families trying to make ends meet than with affluent families who enjoy significant disposable income. My home state provides a great example of the benefits of 529 plans.\u00a0 Thousands of Maine families established these accounts after the law was changed in 2001 to allow tax-free withdrawals for college expenses.\u00a0 In 2008, the Harold Alfond Foundation, which was established by one of Maine\u2019s greatest philanthropists, created the Alfond College Challenge. Today, this program provides a $500 contribution to the college savings account of every baby born in Maine.\u00a0 To date, some 23,000 Maine families have used this generous gift to begin planning for the future education of their children. All told, 38,000 Maine residents now have 529 College Savings Plan accounts, with combined assets of $160 million. Nationally, nearly 12 million Americans have 529 College Savings Plan accounts, with combined assets of $244 billion. The 529 College Savings Plan program channels the virtue of saving into the tangible benefit of helping hard-working middle-income American families save for their children\u2019s college education.\u00a0\u00a0 Changing the tax rules for 529 accounts would break a promise to these families.\u00a0 I urge you to reject the President\u2019s proposal and to save the 529 College Savings Plan program. ###"},

Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) joined as original bill cosponsors. Thirty-nine percent of the homeless population is under the age of 18, and the average age at which a teen becomes homeless is 14.7 years old.\u00a0 A 2013 study by the   offers startling details about the connection between youth homelessness and human trafficking. The Leahy-Collins Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act reauthorizes programs that help youth obtain housing, education and job training. The bill includes training for service providers to identify victims of trafficking, and it includes a new provision that prohibits grantees from denying services based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Leahy and Collins introduced similar legislation last year, which earned bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee but stalled in the Senate. With winter snowstorms in New England and the Mid-Atlantic regions threatening the safety of thousands of Americans, the Senators said it is especially urgent that Congress pass this bipartisan bill. \u201cWe often talk about human trafficking as an international problem, but the sad truth is that it is a major problem right here at home,\u201d Senator Leahy said. \u201cIf we are to make a real difference to end modern day slavery, we must protect those who are most vulnerable and prevent the exploitation in the first place.\u00a0 We cannot simply focus on ending demand and arrest our way out of this problem; we must eliminate the conditions that make these children so vulnerable. Passing the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act is an important step in that direction.\u201d \u201cDespite the recent decline we have seen in chronic homelessness, there are still more than 1.6 million homeless teens in the United States,\u201d Senator Collins said.\u00a0 \u201cAs Chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, one of my goals is to address chronic homelessness.\u00a0 We must make sure our nation\u2019s homeless youth have the same opportunity to succeed as other youth.\u00a0 The programs reauthorized by this bill are critical in helping homeless youth stay off the street and find stable, sustainable housing.\u201d Senator Booker and Senator Ayotte also urged the Senate to take up and pass the bipartisan legislation. \u201cNo young person should face the pain and dangers of homelessness,\u201d\u00a0Senator Booker said.\u00a0\u201cIn urban, suburban, and rural communities all over the country, many of these\u00a0vulnerable youth deal not only with the obvious hazards of homelessness, but also fall victim to emotional and physical exploitation. We have a responsibility and moral obligation to help them. I am grateful to my colleagues Senators Leahy and Collins for their leadership in introducing this legislation which will provide a pathway to housing and the life skills these young people need.\u201d \u201cNo child should have to go without a home, yet right now in New Hampshire, one in every four homeless people are children.\u00a0 That\u2019s a heartbreaking statistic,\u201d Senator Ayotte said.\u00a0 \u201cWe need to find solutions to this pervasive problem, including strategies to address issues like human trafficking and sexual exploitation that can sometimes lead to or coexist with homelessness.\u00a0 By reauthorizing these critical programs, we can help families in New Hampshire and across the nation overcome homelessness and lead independent, fulfilling lives.\u201d The bill is supported by the National Network for Youth, the Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking,\u00a0the True Colors Fund, the Center for American Progress, and the Human Rights Campaign, among many others.\u00a0 A copy of the bill is available  . # # # # #"},
{"title": "Retirement Security: A Path Forward", "date": ["Posted Wed, 01/28/2015 - 13:57"], "release": "WASHINGTON, DC\u2014 Nationally, one in four retired Americans has no source of income beyond Social Security; in Maine, that number is one in three. In addition, a Gallup survey published in 2012 found that more than half of all Americans are worried that they will not be able to maintain their standard of living in retirement. Ensuring that more Americans are better prepared financially for their retirement is a top priority for Senator Susan Collins, Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. This week, Senator Collins will introduce bipartisan legislation that would encourage more small employers to offer retirement plans, provide incentives for employees to save more for retirement, and ensure that low and middle-income working families are able to claim benefits for retirement savings already authorized by law. The bill is cosponsored by Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL). Senator Collins said, \u201cMaking it easier for smaller businesses to provide access to retirement plans for their workers would make a significant difference in the financial security of many Americans. That is why Senator Nelson and I have again joined together to introduce legislation that focuses on reducing the cost and complexity of retirement plans, especially for small businesses, and on encouraging individuals to save more for retirement.\u201d More specifically, the \u201cCollins-Nelson Retirement Security Act of 2015\u201d would: \u2022 Encourage small businesses to offer retirement plans. Cost is a significant reason that more small businesses do not offer retirement plans. The bill would lower costs by allowing small businesses to join multiple employer plans (MEPs) to share the administrative burden of a retirement plan. Second, under current law, one business\u2019s failure to meet the minimum criteria necessary to maintain a tax-preferred retirement plan can endanger benefits for all MEP participants. The bill would direct the Treasury Department to issue regulations to address this issue. The bill reduces costs for all businesses by directing the Treasury Department to simplify, clarify, and consolidate notice requirements for retirement plans. \u2022 Allow employees to save more. The existing safe harbor for so-called \u201cautomatic enrollment\u201d plans effectively caps employee contributions at ten-percent of annual pay, with the employer contributing a \u201cmatching\u201d amount on up to six percent. The bill would create an additional safe harbor for these plans that would allow employees to receive an employer match on contributions of up to ten-percent of their pay. Employees would be able to contribute more than ten-percent, albeit without an employer match. The bill helps the smallest businesses \u2013 those with less than 100 employees \u2013 offset the cost of this additional match by providing a new tax credit equal to the increased match. \u2022 Ensure that low- and middle-income taxpayers can utilize existing incentives to save. The tax code currently provides a non-refundable credit of up to $1,000 for eligible individuals ($2,000 for joint filers), who contribute to IRAs or employer-sponsored retirement plans. This credit is only available to low- and middle-income individuals. Yet the credit cannot be claimed on a Form 1040EZ. This bill would direct Treasury to make the credit available on Form 1040 EZ. The \u201cCollins-Nelson Retirement Security Act of 2015\u201d is supported by about a dozen groups including the Maine Chamber of Commerce."},

Senator Collins says the President\u2019s plan to begin taxing the earnings of 529 College Savings Plan accounts would, instead, make it more difficult for hardworking parents to save and plan for their children\u2019s education. The 529 College Savings Plan allows parents to make contributions to a tax-advantaged account with after-tax dollars from their paychecks. These contributions grow over time and have an enormous impact on what parents are able to save to help their children pursue an education. Changing the tax rules not only breaks a promise to parents who are working hard to provide opportunities for their children, but it also increases the burden of debt a student will face at a time when rising student loan debt is a national concern. In her letter and in her speech on the Senate floor, Senator Collins said, \u201cRather than help American families meet the onerous cost of a college education, this new tax would greatly diminish the benefits of a law that is helping millions of parents plan for their children\u2019s futures.

{"title": "\u201cSaving For Higher Education\u201d", "date": ["Posted Fri, 01/30/2015 - 13:32"], "release": "In President Obama\u2019s recent State of the Union Address, he outlined an agenda focused on what he called middle class economics, which he described as providing Americans with the \u2018\u2018tools they needed to go as far as their effort and their dreams will take them.\u2019\u2019 Our country thrives when hard-working Americans prosper. The President was right to praise policies, such as the GI bill and Social Security, that have helped us to do just that. That is why I was perplexed at the President\u2019s proposal to tax the earnings of what are known as 529 college savings plan accounts. This proposed new tax would greatly diminish the benefits of a law that is helping millions of parents plan for their children\u2019s futures. And that is why I spoke on the Senate floor in opposition to the President\u2019s proposal that undermines the very values we should be promoting \u2014 families making sacrifices today in order to better provide for their children\u2019s education tomorrow. The President\u2019s plan would also lead to more student loan debt for many young people at a time when concern over the level of debt is rising. The President also proposed eliminating the tax deduction on interest on student loan payments. One of the first questions new parents ask themselves is how will they be able to pay for their children\u2019s education. For the past 14 years, the 529 accounts have been an important part of the answer. They have allowed parents to save for their children\u2019s education in tax-advantaged accounts. Regular, affordable contributions made with after-tax dollars from their paychecks grow over time. When college years start, those savings and the earnings from their investments can be withdrawn tax free for educational expenses. These small sacrifices made from paycheck to paycheck can have an enormous impact, making real the dream of higher education. Parents know that receiving a college degree greatly improves their child\u2019s future earnings potential. In fact, according to data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau in the year 2011, individuals with college degrees earn approximately $1 million more over the course of their careers than do workers with high school diplomas. Census data also showed that people with higher levels of education are more likely to be employed full time year-round. College graduates also tend to have access to more specialized jobs that, in turn, yield higher wages. Critics of the 529 plans assert that they disproportionately benefit very high-income families who could afford to pay for college without the tax-free growth in these dedicated savings accounts. Data from the College Savings Foundation, however, counters this assertion. According to the foundation, the average value in one of these 529 accounts is a modest $19,774. Additionally, the average contribution to accounts that receive regular electronic contributions, such as those coming from paycheck withholding, is just $175 a month. That is clearly more in line with hard-working families trying to make ends meet than with affluent families who enjoy significant disposable income. Maine provides a great example of the benefits of the 529 law. After this law was passed in 2001, thousands of Maine families established these accounts, but then came a powerful extra incentive. In 2008, the Harold Alfond Foundation, which was established by one of Maine\u2019s greatest philanthropists, created the Harold Alfond College Challenge. This program now provides a $500 contribution to the college savings account of every baby born in Maine. To date, some 23,000 Maine families have used this generous gift to begin planning for the future education of their children. As their parents\u2019 own contributions are added to the account, the future becomes even brighter for these children and for our State. As the children grow and make their own contributions from after school and summer jobs, so too grows their appreciation of financial responsibility and self-reliance. The President said his proposal is driven in part by the need to simplify the tax code. Our tax code certainly needs simplification, and I hope that becomes a major accomplishment of this Congress. But the question must be asked\u2014how does creating a difference between the 529 contributions already made, which would remain untaxed, and new contributions, which would be taxed, simplify anything? And perhaps more to the point, in addition to simplification, our tax code needs predictability. Before I joined the Senate, I was worked at Husson University in Bangor \u2014an outstanding institution that has a high percentage of students who are the very first in their families to attend college. Every day, I saw how hard parents and students worked, how many sacrifices they made in order to make higher education a reality. My experience at Husson is the chief reason why one of the very first bills I introduced when I joined the Senate was the College Affordability and Access Act. That bill called for creating tax-preferred education savings accounts\u2014the precursor to the Coverdell savings accounts\u2014tax incentives for employer-provided educational assistance, and a tax deduction for student loan interest. Many provisions of that bill are now law but would also be harmed by the President\u2019s proposal. The 529 college savings plan program channels the determination that I saw while working at Husson University and that exists throughout our great country into a tangible benefit built upon the virtues of saving and planning for the future. Changing the tax rules for the 529 accounts would break a promise to families across this country who are working hard to save for their children\u2019s educations to help them attain a brighter future. Fortunately, it appears that the President\u2019s ill-conceived proposal is going nowhere. Shortly after other Senate colleagues joined me in raising objections to the President\u2019s proposal, the White House announced that the Administration would reconsider it.

On the positive side, he would end the mindless, across-the-board cuts known as sequestration which fail to set priorities. Unfortunately, however, rather than show fiscal responsibility and restraint, the President\u2019s budget continues to add to our national debt at a rate where interest payments will increase to $800 billion a year by 2025 and will exceed spending on every program other than Social Security and Medicare. That alarming increase is unsustainable and should concern Democrats and Republicans alike. \u201cWhile the Administration is proposing to raise the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s overall budget by $4 billion next year, it would slash the Community Development Block Grant program by $200 million. This program provides critical support for local and state economic development and job creation efforts, and I will oppose this cut as the Chairman of the Transportation and Housing Appropriations Subcommittee. In addition to this cut, the budget eliminates additional funding for new Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) vouchers in the hope that veterans\u2019 homelessness will end in 2015. The VASH program has been critical to reducing homelessness among our nation's veterans, and it is too early to determine if it has outlived its important purpose or yet achieved the goal of ending homelessness among our veterans. \u201cI agree with the President that we need to invest in infrastructure. Structurally deficient bridges and crumbling roads exist in virtually every state, particularly in large rural states like Maine subject to cold climates. These investments are critical to public safety and economic prosperity. I will carefully review the President\u2019s request, including the funding mechanism he proposes. \u201cAt a time when we are faced with serious national security challenges on several fronts, I am pleased that the President\u2019s budget would continue funding for the DDG-1000 program and full funding for two DDG-51s, one of which is slated to be built at Bath Iron Works. I\u2019m disappointed, however, that the President has yet again proposed another Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round, which doesn\u2019t make sense for our national defense and has never achieved the promised savings for taxpayers in previous rounds of base closures. \u201cI am pleased that the President\u2019s budget recognizes that investments in biomedical research not only improve the health and longevity of Americans, but also provides benefits to our economy as well. The Administration has proposed an additional $1 billion for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Of this amount, the NIH projects it will spend $638 million on Alzheimer\u2019s research, an increase of $51 million over 2015.Alzheimer\u2019s is a devastating disease that exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll. In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer\u2019s costs the United States more than $214 billion a year, including $150 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid.

This bill was approved by the House of Representatives last month and will now be sent to the President for his signature.

{"title": "Senators Collins, Cardin, King Lead Senate Support For Growing American Craft Beer Industry", "date": ["Posted Wed, 02/04/2015 - 18:22"], "release": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Ben Cardin (D-MD) have reintroduced  , to stimulate regional economies nationwide with a reduction in the excise tax on each barrel of beer brewed by small brewers. Senator Angus King (I-ME) is an original cosponsor of this bill which would change the threshold definition of a small brewer to better reflect modern production. The Small BREW Act of 2015 would reduce the federal excise tax on every one of America\u2019s small craft brewers. Under current federal law, brewers producing fewer than 2 million barrels annually pay $7 per barrel in federal excise taxes on the first 60,000 barrels they brew, and $18 per barrel on every additional barrel (one barrel = 31 gallons). Under the Small BREW Act, the rate would be $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels. For production between 60,001 and 2 million barrels, the rate would be $16.00 per barrel. Then, the rate would be $18.00 per barrel. Breweries with annual production of 6 million or fewer barrels would qualify for these new tax rates. \u201cMaine is home to dozens of unique craft breweries and brewpubs that invigorate our economy by providing more than 1,400 jobs and drawing countless tourists into our state,\u201d Senator Collins said. \u201cIn meeting with brewers across Maine, they always make clear to me how federal tax policy affects their businesses. Our bill would help reduce the tax burden placed on many small brewers across our country, allowing them to thrive, create jobs, and further grow our economy.\u201d \u201cMaine is home to an incredible array of small, independent craft brewers that deliver world-class products and quality jobs,\u201d Senator King said. \u201cBy reducing the tax burden on our brewers, this important piece of legislation will give them a vital boost and enable them to further invest in their businesses and our communities \u2013 a winning combination that will create jobs in Maine and across the nation.\u201d \u201cSmall brewers have been anchors of local communities and America\u2019s economy since the start of our history. In addition to making high-quality beers, Maryland craft brewers create jobs and reinvest their profits back into their local economies,\u201d said Senator Cardin, Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business & Entrepreneurship Committee and a member of the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cThe federal government needs to be investing in industries that invest in America and create real jobs here at home. With more than 3,200 small and independent breweries currently operating in the US, now is the time to help this industry \u2013 and our economy \u2013 keep growing stronger.\u201d There are now more than 3,200 small and independent breweries in the United States, with approximately 1.5 more opening every day, according to the Brewers Association. Even though these small breweries represent about 12 percent of the U.S. beer industry in volume terms, they now represent the majority of jobs in beer. In 2013, craft breweries directly employed 110,273 people. They had a total economic impact of more than 360,000 full-time equivalent jobs generating more than $3 billion in wages and benefits; and paying more than $2.3 billion in business, personal and consumption taxes in towns and cities across America. Because of differences in economies of scale, small brewers have higher costs for raw materials, production, packaging, and market entry compared to larger, well-established multinational competitors. Adjusting the excise tax rate would provide small brewers with an additional $65-$70 million each year they could use to start or expand their businesses on a local, regional, or national scale. (now at Brown University) found that the bill would generate $183.1 million in economic activity in the first year and almost $1.04 billion over five years and would also create nearly 5,230 jobs in just the first year. Maine has 61 craft brewers, with at least a dozen more in the planning stages. The small brewer threshold and tax rate were established in 1976 and have never been updated. Since then, the largest multinational producer of beer has increased its annual production from 45 million barrels to 97 million barrels domestically and 325 million barrels globally. Raising the ceiling that defines small breweries from two million barrels to six million barrels more accurately reflects the intent of the original differentiation between large and small brewers in the U.S. Other cosponsors of the   include Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Bob Casey (D-Penn.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Barbara A.

{"title": "Senate Aging Committee Holds Hearing To Examine Financial Exploitation Of Seniors", "date": ["Posted Fri, 02/06/2015 - 11:04"], "release": "WASHINGTON, DC- Financial exploitation of older Americans is a growing epidemic that cost seniors an estimated $2.9 billion in 2010, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). In Maine alone, there are 14,000 new reports each year of senior abuse. In as many of 90 percent of these financial abuse cases, the senior is victimized by someone he or she knows well. Financial exploitation of vulnerable seniors was the topic of a hearing today of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which is chaired by Senator Susan Collins. Among the witnesses at today\u2019s hearing was Judith Shaw, Maine\u2019s Administrator of the Office of Securities. Also appearing before the Aging Committee today was Philip Marshall who is the grandson of the late Brooke Astor, a New York philanthropist whose son, Anthony Marshall, mistreated her and mismanaged her funds while she suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Ms. Astor summered in Maine for many years. Senator Collins said, \u201cIt is deeply troubling when a senior falls victim to financial exploitation, but even more egregious when the perpetrator is a family member, caregiver, or trusted advisor.\u201d Senator Collins went on to explain that many of these cases are never reported because the victim is too ashamed to report financial exploitation, particularly when it involves a family member, and the victims often do not want their relatives to be criminally prosecuted. \u201cThis financial loss can undermine both the health of older Americans and their financial security,\u201d added Senator Collins. The Senator pointed to the Senior$afe program in Maine as an example of an innovative program created to combat financial exploitation of seniors. Senior$afe is a collaborative effort by Maine\u2019s regulators, financial institutions, and legal organizations to educate bank and credit unions employees about how to identify and help stop financial exploitation of older Mainers. Judith Shaw, who also serves as Co-chair of the Maine Council for Elder Abuse Prevention cited a 2010 Investor Protection Trust Elder Fraud Survey indicating that one out of every five citizens over the age of 65 has been victimized by financial fraud. Ms. Shaw described financial exploitation of seniors as a \u201ccommunity problem that requires a holistic, community solution.\u201d Shaw said that \u201cwe must identify those who are best positioned to identify red flags early on and encourage reporting and referrals to appropriate local, county, state, and federal agencies, including law enforcement.\u201d Philip Marshall said that his grandmother, who was a well-known philanthropist and was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton, would never wanted to have been known as \u201cone of America\u2019s most famous cases of elder abuse.\u201d But despite her strong commitment to philanthropic work, her greatest legacy, according to Marshall, could be that her case has helped raise awareness of senior financial abuse. Wednesday\u2019s hearing, titled \u201cBroken Trust: Combating Financial Exploitation of Vulnerable Seniors,\u201d is a continuation of the work the Senate Special Committee on Aging has done to aggressively fight fraud and financial schemes targeting seniors. Additional witnesses included, Kathleen Quinn, Executive Director of the National Adult Protective Services Association; and Page Ulrey, Senior Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, Elder Abuse team, King County, Washington."},

At issue are potentially illegal subsidies being provided by the provincial government of Nova Scotia to the Port Hawkesbury Paper mill in Nova Scotia. Yesterday, Madison Paper Industries, which owns a mill in Madison, cited these subsidies as a major reason why it is being forced to curtail production for at least two weeks later this month and temporarily lay off most non-salaried employees. In their letter to Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, Senators Collins and King and Congressman Poliquin wrote, \u201cMembers of the Maine delegation have previously brought this matter to the attention of U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, and we understand that the current Trade Representative Michael Froman raised this issue on several occasions with the Canadian trade authorities. Despite these efforts, the subsidies continue to flow from the Nova Scotia government to Port Hawkesbury Paper, putting U.S. jobs at continued risk. \u201cWe respectfully ask that you do everything legally within your power as Secretary of Commerce to address this issue and put a stop to these unfair subsidies.

Yesterday, Madison Paper Industries (MPI), a mill in Madison, Maine, that produces supercalendered paper, announced that it will soon curtail production for a period of at least two weeks, requiring it to lay off most non-salaried employees temporarily. This comes on top of several other high-profile mill closures in the last year that have cost far too many men and women in Maine\u2019s papermaking industry their livelihoods. The President of MPI cited as a factor in the layoffs the unfair subsidies provided by the provincial government of Nova Scotia to a paper producer in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia. These subsidies have put U.S. producers of supercalendered paper at a significant competitive disadvantage, and the excess production generated by them has caused the prices for supercalendered paper to plummet, reducing the sales revenue for U.S. producers. The subsidies at issue are significant, reportedly totaling more than $125 million, and take the form of loans, grants, tax breaks, and reduced energy costs. Moreover, we understand from Madison Paper that the Canadian company, Port Hawkesbury Paper, has applied for $40 million in additional government aid from Canada\u2019s Forest Industry Transformation Fund. Members of the Maine delegation have previously brought this matter to the attention of U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, and we understand that the current Trade Representative Michael Froman raised this issue on several occasions with the Canadian trade authorities. Despite these efforts, the subsidies continue to flow from the Nova Scotia government to Port Hawkesbury Paper, putting U.S. jobs at continued risk. We respectfully ask that you do everything legally within your power as Secretary of Commerce to address this issue and put a stop to these unfair subsidies. The consensus for fair and open trade is predicated on having trade rules by which everyone lives. Thank you for your attention to this important matter. We look forward to your response and to working with you to stop these unfair subsidies before irreversible harm is done to the U.S. industry. ###"},

While I would have much preferred each of these bills to have been brought to the floor individually so they could be debated and amended, passage of this compromise legislation to keep government open and provide vital services to Americans who depend on them is essential. \"While the legislation funds nearly all government operations, programs, and agencies through the remainder of the fiscal year, notably, this bill funds the Department of Homeland Security only through February 27, 2015, giving Congress time to thoughtfully respond to the President\u2019s unilateral action on immigration. While I supported the bipartisan legislation to reform our immigration laws that passed the Senate last year, I believe President Obama\u2019s recent executive action on immigration circumvents Congress and undermines the separation of powers in our Constitution. This bill gives Congress time to formulate an appropriate response. \"In addition to the regular funding contained in this bill, the legislation also provides more than $5 billion in emergency funding to address the Ebola crisis at home and abroad. The scope and urgency of this crisis require continued attention, and this funding will build on the important initial investment for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services that Congress provided in September. \"Over this past year, as leaders of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and I worked together to craft a bipartisan bill that includes input from Members on both sides of the aisle and provides the necessary resources to meet our nation\u2019s transportation and housing needs. Every Member of Congress has unmet transportation and housing needs in his or her home state, from crumbling roads and bridges to a growing population of low income families, elderly, and disabled individuals in need of housing assistance. \"There are a number of key programs that I would like to highlight. With regard to transportation infrastructure, we secured funding to address the safe transportation of crude oil and other hazardous materials by rail, strengthening three components: prevention, mitigation, and response. These safety measures will help to prevent disasters like the horrific derailment in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, last year \u2013 so very close to the Maine border. \"We also provide $500 million for the TIGER program, an effective initiative that helps advance transportation infrastructure projects. We all have seen firsthand how TIGER projects create jobs and support economic growth in our home states. In fact, in Maine, this highly competitive program has supported more than $90 million in funding for roads, bridges, ports, and rail projects. \"Turning to air travel, the aviation investments included in the bill will continue to modernize our nation\u2019s air traffic system and keep rural communities connected to the transportation network. These investments are creating safer skies and a more efficient airspace to move the flying public. \"Also included in the bill are provisions I authored, which were adopted by the Appropriations Committee by a bipartisan vote of 21 to 9, to respond to potential safety concerns related to DOT regulations governing truck drivers. As a result of unintended consequences of these regulations, more trucks have been forced on our nation\u2019s roads during the most congested morning hours \u2013 when commuters are traveling to work and children are traveling to school. The bill provides temporary relief until the DOT Secretary conducts a comprehensive study on the impacts of these unanticipated outcomes. \"In addition to these transportation programs, our bill provides sufficient funding to keep pace with the rising cost of housing programs for our most vulnerable families. More than four million families will continue to receive critical rental assistance for housing. Without it, many of these families would otherwise become homeless. \"The bill reflects our strong commitment to reduce homelessness and includes more than $2 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants. Since 2010, we have reduced overall chronic homelessness by 21 percent and veterans\u2019 homelessness by 33 percent. This program works. That is why we build on these successes and provide an additional 10,000 HUD-VASH vouchers to serve our nation\u2019s veterans. \"While we continue to help families in need, we also recognize the struggles facing our local communities. Boosting local economies is critical to job creation and helping families obtain financial security. Our bill supports these local development efforts by providing $3 billion for the Community Development Block Grants program. This is an extremely important program for states and communities because it allows them to tailor the federal funds to support local economic and job creation projects. \"Other provisions of the bill make equally important investments in our national security, energy infrastructure, veterans, and health and human services. \"For our military and our national security, I particularly appreciate that the bill fully funds the Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51 and Zumwalt-class DDG-1000 destroyers. The destroyers are known as the real workhorses of the fleet and are critical to maintaining the robust forward naval presence our nation requires especially in a time of increasing threats to our security. The continued support of the destroyer programs is also a strong testament to the hard work and dedication of the men and women at Bath Iron Works in Maine. Bath-built truly is best built. \"The bill also includes funding for the procurement of 38 F-35s and for four additional aircraft. The F-35 is vital to maintaining air superiority, and components of the aircraft are built by skilled workers at Pratt & Whitney in North Berwick, General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems in Saco, Hunting Dearborn, Inc. in Fryeburg, and Fairchild Semiconductor in South Portland. Neither the bill, nor the report, recommends an unnecessary study of an extra engine for the F-35 fighter, which would have wasted billions of dollars. \"Turning to our nation\u2019s public shipyards, I am pleased that this bill funds our Navy\u2019s facility maintenance and modernization efforts, including projects at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. The agreement contains language I secured that ensures the capital investment for the Navy\u2019s four public shipyards, including the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, is funded at the level required by law. \"For the men and women serving in uniform all over the world, the bill also rightly rejects many of the President\u2019s proposals that would have imposed burdens on many service members and their families. \"For our Veterans, I am pleased that this bill provides funding for the highly successful Access Received Closer to Home program, or ARCH, which provides critical care to our Veterans living in rural areas, including those living in Northern Maine. The ARCH pilot program provides VA-covered health care services through non-VA providers and has been crucial to increasing access to care for rural Maine veterans. \"The funding bill also provides additional resources to implement the reforms included in the recently enacted Veterans Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act. \"We must increase our investment in biomedical research, and this bill provides $72 million in new funding for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease research, treatment, and caregiver programs. This important step takes us closer toward the goal of doubling funding for Alzheimer's research and eventually reaching the level of $2 billion a year in federal investment. This is the amount that the Chairman of the Alzheimer's Advisory Council has said will be necessary if we are to reach our goal of having a way to prevent or effectively treat Alzheimer\u2019s Disease by 2025. At a time when Alzheimer\u2019s is costing our nation $214 billion a year, including $150 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid, we are spending less than $600 million a year on Alzheimer\u2019s research. While this bill does take a step forward, clearly we need to do more given the tremendous human and economic toll this devastating disease takes on our nation. \"In addition, this funding bill makes important investments in agricultural research and extension activities, from potatoes to wild blueberries to aquaculture and forest products, while maintaining a commitment to nutrition and food security. The agreement finally allows all fresh vegetables, including the fresh, white potato, to be included in the WIC program while USDA carries out an evaluation of the nutrient value of all vegetables, helping to ensure that any long-term policy is transparent and reflects the latest science. \"This bill also makes important commitments to our energy infrastructure and provides robust funding for the Department of Energy wind program. This program funds the offshore wind demonstration projects, including the R&D project being carried out by the University of Maine. Federal seed money is helping overcome barriers to the development and implementation of new and innovative technologies, such as deepwater offshore wind, which can position the U.S. as a global leader in innovative clean energy. \"To help address the high cost of residential energy, particularly for those living in northern, rural states like Maine, funding is provided in this bill for the Weatherization program. This program plays an important role in permanently reducing home energy costs for low-income families and seniors. Moreover, the funding included for LIHEAP will help ensure that many of our most vulnerable families and seniors do not have to choose between paying for heat and paying for other necessities such as food or medicine. \"Helping to meet the water infrastructure needs of smaller states and regions is another vital piece of our national infrastructure. This bill includes funding for the operation and maintenance of Army Corps projects at smaller harbors, which are the economic lifeblood for many rural communities, a fact not fully accounted for under the Corps\u2019 budget metrics, which tend to favor larger ports. \"The bill also continues to support our nation's fisheries, which are so important to the economies of our coastal communities, particularly in Maine. From funding for annual stock assessments, surveys and monitoring, and cooperative research, the bill supports key state and federal partnerships. It provides funding to ensure fisheries data collection accurately reflects stock sustainability and funding for NOAA to invest in the science and research necessary to sustainably manage our fisheries in a way that continues to support our fishing fleets. \"Finally, I am pleased to see that the bill includes full funding for the Trade Adjustment Assistance programs that are so important in Maine, and for which Senator King and I both advocated. As we continue to deal with the recent job losses at paper mills in Maine, this assistance to displaced workers is extremely important. \"Completing action on this bill will keep government open and provide essential services to Americans who depend on them. While there are aspects of this compromise legislation that should have been subject to debate and amendment in an open process by the full Senate, including provisions that affect significantly multi-employer pensions and our campaign finance laws, we simply cannot allow a government shutdown.\" ###"},

Collins' Bill To Study Creation Of National Women's History Museum", "date": ["Posted Tue, 12/16/2014 - 11:58"], "release": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 A bill to form a commission on the creation of a National Women\u2019s History Museum, authored by Senator Susan Collins, will soon become law. The bill was included in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act which has been approved by both the Senate and House and will soon be signed by the President. \u201cI have been proud to lead the effort to establish a museum for women\u2019s history since 2003. The need for a museum recognizing the contributions of American women is long overdue, and the Commission approved today is an important first step towards that goal,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cA National Women\u2019s History Museum would help ensure that future generations understand what we owe to the many generations of American women who have helped build, sustain, and advance our society. This can and should be done at no expense to American taxpayers.\u201d The law will establish a privately-funded commission to prepare a report containing recommendations for establishing and maintaining a National Women\u2019s History Museum in Washington, D.C. The 8-member commission would have 18 months to produce the report and submit it to Congress for approval. Members of the commission will be appointed by Speaker of the House John Boehner, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. This bipartisan legislation passed by a vote of 383 to 33 in the House on May 7, 2014. The Senate legislation introduced by Collins and Mikulski was cosponsored by 39 Senators, including all 20 women Senators. The legislation was added to a package of Natural Resources bills, which was later attached as a separate title of the National Defense Authorization Act. The bill is cosponsored by Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), and Reps. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY), Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), and Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC). \u201cWomen\u2019s history is American history,\u201d said Senator Mikulski. \u201cWomen have been trailblazers throughout our history, using grit, passion, and determination to seize the day and to make a difference. We must not only honor the past \u2013 we must learn from it. A National Women\u2019s History Museum will be a fitting tribute to recognize their lasting legacy while inspiring future generations of women and girls.\u201d \u201cWhen I first introduced legislation to form a National Women\u2019s History Museum, I never dreamed it would take 16 years to get this commission passed,\u201d said Rep. Maloney. \u201cIt seemed like an easy lift \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see who can be opposed to a museum dedicated to chronicling the achievements of women. Women gained the right to vote in 1920. I hope that a century later, in 2020, the efforts and accomplishments of women throughout our history will be chronicled in a museum that both our daughters and sons can learn from and enjoy.\u201d \u201cThe legacies of women who paved the way before us and helped shape our nation deserve to be preserved and shared with our citizens,\u201d said Rep. Blackburn. \u201cI am honored to have worked with Rep. Maloney and Senators Collins and Mikulski to push this legislation across the finish line so that these stories can inspire future generations by illustrating how the bravery, patriotism, and perseverance of our nation\u2019s women can truly make a difference. We look forward to this bill being signed into law by the President.\u201d \u201cSurely, American women deserve a museum to showcase their significant contributions that have been indispensable to our country,\u201d said Rep. Norton. \u201cThat is why I have been working to establish this museum in my district, the nation\u2019s capital, with Rep. Maloney and other women in the House and Senate for many years. The museum seeks only to help ensure that the contributions women have made to our nation are understood as part of our history and collective conscience. We look forward to the report, and to moving forward with a museum that encourages and empowers even more women to make contributions and to take on leadership roles.\u201d According to the Congressional Budget Office, the commission and the museum would have no significant impact on federal spending. The bill authorizes the commission to accept and spend monetary gifts and a 501(c)3 organization, National Women\u2019s History Museum, is already raising the funds necessary to fund the commission. ###"},
{"title": "\u201cWreaths Across America\u201d", "date": ["Posted Thu, 12/18/2014 - 10:54"], "release": "In this season of giving, our thoughts turn to those who have given us the most precious gift of all: our freedom.\u00a0 We Mainers can be proud that an inspiring and generous expression of America\u2019s gratitude began right here in our state. This marks the 23rd year that the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington has spearheaded an effort known as \u201cWreaths Across America.\u201d\u00a0 Since its inception, the Wreaths Across America project has become an annual tradition of donating, transporting, and placing Maine balsam fir remembrance wreaths on the graves of our fallen heroes buried at Arlington National Cemetery, as well as at Veterans\u2019 cemeteries and memorials in every state and overseas.\u00a0 In the program\u2019s first 23 years, more than 1.7 million wreaths have been placed in honor of those who have served our country. In recognition of the Worcester family\u2019s hard work and the generosity of all those who have helped in the effort, the United States Senate unanimously passed a Resolution that I authored, which Senator Angus King cosponsored, designating December 13, 2014, as \u201cWreaths Across America Day.\u201d\u00a0 On this December 13, thousands of volunteers, across the river in Arlington, throughout our nation, at such overseas locations as Normandy, and on our Navy ships at sea, will carry out the mission of Wreaths Across America to \u201cRemember, Honor, Teach.\u201d\u00a0 This will be the culmination of a week-long procession between Maine and Virginia, with stops along the way to spread a message about the importance of remembering and honoring those who serve, and teaching the people of the United States about the sacrifices made by Veterans and their families. This year, as in years past, the Patriot Guard Riders, along with other patriotic groups and Maine\u2019s First Lady Ann LePage, will escort the tractor-trailers filled with donated wreaths from Maine to Arlington National Cemetery.\u00a0 America\u2019s trucking industry will continue to support Wreaths Across America by providing drivers, equipment, fuel, and related services to assist in the transportation of wreaths across the country to more than 1,000 locations. In recent years, Wreaths Across America has provided some 130,000 wreaths to Arlington National Cemetery.\u00a0 To mark Arlington\u2019s 150th anniversary, the goal this year is to decorate each of the 230,000 Veterans\u2019 graves and memorials on that hallowed ground.\u00a0 Thanks to the generosity and gratitude of the American people, this goal will surely be achieved. The origin of Wreaths Across America is an inspiring example of that generosity and gratitude.\u00a0 During the Christmas season in 1991, Morrill and Karen Worcester took time during their busiest season to donate and deliver 5,000 wreaths from their company in Harrington, Maine, to Arlington National Cemetery to honor the heroes who lie at rest there.\u00a0 At first, a small band of volunteers laid the wreaths quietly and with little notice.\u00a0 In recent years, however, the Arlington Wreath Project has grown to become a national phenomenon.\u00a0 The people of Maine are proud that this heartfelt gesture of America\u2019s gratitude began in our state. Wreaths Across America honors our departed heroes, but it does even more.\u00a0 It tells the Veterans still with us that we honor their service.\u00a0 It tells our men and women in uniform today that we are grateful for their courage and devotion to duty.\u00a0 It tells the families of those serving our country that they are in our thoughts and prayers.\u00a0 And it tells the families of the fallen that we share their grief.\u00a0 Throughout human history, the evergreen wreath has been offered as a tribute to heroes.\u00a0 On December 13, we will again offer this enduring symbol of valor and sacrifice.\u00a0 In this season of giving, we will pay tribute to those who have given us the most precious gift of all, our freedom. \u00a0"},

Given the sound nutritional facts and the economic implications for Maine\u2019s potato industry, I worked hard to bring together a bipartisan coalition to finally support the potato\u2019s inclusion in the WIC program."},

The bill is aimed at lowering the incidence of women developing diabetes during pregnancy and preventing women and their children from developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and affects up to 18 percent of all pregnancies in the United States. \u00a0\u201cDiabetes takes a serious toll on the wellbeing of millions of Americans and our healthcare system,\u201d Senator Shaheen said. \u201cThe legislation we\u2019ve introduced today will help improve health outcomes for mothers and children who are threatened by the growing epidemic of gestational diabetes. With smart investments in both research, prevention and treatment, we can improve the quality of life for millions of mothers and babies as well as save on health care costs.\u201d \u00a0\u201cOur legislation would help to stem the growing epidemic of gestational diabetes in our country, which puts the health of both mother and child at risk,\u201d said Senator Collins.\u00a0 \u201cThe evidence is clear that there is a direct link between gestational diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Our legislation would help to identify new treatments and interventions that will reduce the incidence of the disorder and the subsequent risk of mother and child developing Type 2 diabetes in the future.\u201d The growing incidence of gestational diabetes carries dangerous health consequences for both the mother and child if left untreated \u2013 including preterm delivery, caesarian section and preeclampsia, a life threatening disorder. It also places both the mother and baby at an increased risk for obesity and developing type 2 diabetes later in life. The Shaheen and Collins legislation bolsters research on gestational diabetes by giving the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to expand and enhance monitoring of the disease and to further test evidence-based interventions. The legislation authorizes research funding and establishes demonstration programs to reduce the occurrence of gestational disease.\u00a0In addition, the legislation requires the CDC to work with providers to ensure that women who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes receive proper follow-up care.

{"title": "Collins, Donnelly, Murkowski, Manchin: 40 Hours Is Full Time", "date": ["Posted Wed, 01/07/2015 - 14:58"], "release": "Washington, D.C. \u2013\u00a0Today U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Joe Donnelly (D\u2013IN) along with Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) announced the reintroduction of the bipartisan\u00a0Forty Hours is Full Time Act,\u00a0S. 30,\u00a0which would change the definition of a \u201cfull-time employee\u201d under the Affordable Care Act to someone who works an average of 40 hours per week. The senators have heard first-hand that some employers are making decisions to cut employees\u2019 hours due to how the health care law defines a \u201cfull-time employee\u201d \u2013 as someone who works an average of 30 hours per week. Employers are making the law\u2019s 30-hour standard a part of their business planning, and as a result more than\u00a0450 employers\u00a0nationwide, including 100 school districts,\u00a0have already chosen to cut their workers\u2019 hours to 29 hours a week or fewer. Collins and Donnelly first introduced this bipartisan solution in 2013 with the aim of making the health care law work better for families, employers, and employees. The bipartisan legislation, which the senators announced Wednesday, would help employees impacted by the current definition of full-time worker and allow employers to better plan for the future by using the more commonly accepted definition of \u201cfull time\u201d: someone who works 40 hours. Collins\u00a0said, \u201cOur legislation is very straightforward and would remedy a serious flaw in the Affordable Care Act that is causing workers to have their hours reduced and their pay cut.\u00a0 The law creates a perverse incentive for businesses to cut their employees\u2019 hours so they are no longer considered \u201cfull time.\u201d\u00a0 Our concerns are not hypothetical, more than 450 employers have already cut work hours or staffing levels in response to the law as of September 2013.\u00a0 Employees of for-profit businesses are not the only ones who are threatened by this illogical definition of full-time work.\u00a0 In Maine, I have heard from organizations like home care agencies, hospitals, and school departments. \u00a0Our goal is simple.\u00a0 We want to protect part-time workers from having their hours reduced and their paychecks cut because of the definition in this law.\u201d Donnelly\u00a0said, \u201cI supported the Affordable Care Act because I wanted to help working- and middle-class families to have access to health care.\u00a0 That doesn\u2019t mean that the law is perfect, and it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t still have work to do.\u00a0 That\u2019s why I\u2019m working with my colleagues to make this bill stronger. In Indiana, common wisdom is that full-time is a 40-hour work week, and the health care law should reflect that. From grocery store employees to school cafeteria managers to adjunct professors at colleges, part-time workers across many industries have seen their hours cut to comply with the health care law. \u00a0This is impacting their pocketbooks and ability to make ends meet or save for the future. I am hopeful the Senate will soon consider this commonsense legislation.\u201d Murkowski\u00a0said, \u201cThe\u00a0Forty Hours is Full Time Act\u00a0is a necessary step for our small business community and the Americans they want to hire, but end up feeling pinched by this lost wage incentive. The fact that this is a bipartisan effort demonstrates that this is not a right or left issue, but a right or wrong one. This bill costs payroll for our service industry, and is leading to higher costs passed onto customers.\u201d Manchin\u00a0said, \u201cIn the almost 5 years since the Affordable Care Act became law, we have all seen the need for reforms to this legislation,\u201d Senator Manchin said. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve worked through a few of these issues in Congress, our job is far from over. One of the most straightforward fixes is to change the definition of fulltime employment under the law from 30 to 40 hours per week. This is simply common sense. Businesses across the country use this employment standard, and there is no reason why the health care law cannot comply, as well. Effective health care reform should expand access to coverage without curbing economic growth or harming vulnerable workers, which is why is it imperative to make this easy fix to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d The\u00a0Forty Hours is Full Time Act\u00a0reintroduced this week is the same legislation that Collins and Donnelly first introduced in June 2013. The House is expected to vote on its own version of this legislation in the coming days. ###"},

Collins Supports Bipartisan Push To Reform Student Loan Repayment Programs", "date": ["Posted Wed, 01/07/2015 - 16:07"], "release": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Today, U.S. Senators Angus King (I-Maine) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.), along with Senators Mark Warner (D-Va.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), introduced legislation to reform federal student loan repayment programs. The Repay Act, which Senators King and Burr originally introduced last Congress, would simplify the complex maze of federal student loan repayment programs\u00a0 by consolidating many of the benefits of current repayment programs into two plans: a fixed repayment plan, based on a 10-year period, and a single, simplified income-driven repayment option. \u00a0 \u201cThe federal government\u2019s student loan repayment programs, although well-intentioned, have grown to be complicated and confusing and do not serve the interests of America\u2019s students or America\u2019s taxpayers,\u201d Senator King said. \u201cThe government should be making it easier for students to pursue their dreams after graduation \u2013 not saddle them with the added anxiety of combing through perplexing government forms. This bipartisan proposal simplifies loan repayment by consolidating many of the benefits of the existing plans, making it easier for students to decide which option best fits their needs, and lowering the chance they will fall behind on their payments.\u201d \u201cNorth Carolinians are tired of seeing their hard-earned tax dollars go to waste in a student loan program that serves neither their interests nor those of the college students it is intended to help. That is why Senator King and I are reintroducing the Repay Act,\u201d said Senator Burr.\u00a0 \u201cThe Repay Act has two very simple goals: First, students should be presented with clear options on how to repay their student loan debts affordably and in a straightforward manner.\u00a0 Second, taxpayers should no longer subsidize the excessive borrowing and loan forgiveness that Washington has allowed to take place over the past few years.\u00a0 Although more can be done to address the deficiencies in our student loan programs, the Repay Act is a responsible step in the right direction toward better fiscal management of our loan programs that allows students to make well-informed decisions about borrowing for college.\u00a0 I look forward to working with my colleagues Senators King, Alexander, Warner, Rubio, and Collins to see the Senate pass this legislation to make repaying student loans simpler and fairer.\u201d \u201cThe Repay Act streamlines the federal loan program and ensures that graduates have affordable payment options in a way that is simple and intuitive,\u201d Senator Warner said. \u201cThis bill incorporates several of the concepts Senator Rubio and I put forward last Congress, and I am encouraged to join this bipartisan group of colleagues in advocating for these much needed reforms as we look to reauthorize the Higher Education Act.\u00a0 Virginia students, graduates, and families are looking for student loan reforms that allows them to meet their obligations while also providing necessary protections.\u201d \u201cHelping more people achieve the American Dream requires equipping them with the education and training necessary to do the jobs of the 21st century. The Repay Act would help modernize the income-based repayment system for student loans, which Senator Warner and I have also been working on for the past year. We need reforms like this to ensure that the burden of student loans is more manageable to discourage overborrowing,\u201d Senator Rubio said. \u201cI believe this bill\u2019s requirement for the GAO to study the best way enroll, verify income and facilitate income-based repayment programs will ultimately help build momentum for other initiatives I will continue working on as the Senate considers higher education reform later this year.\u201d \u201cEducation plays a vital role in opening the doors of opportunity to all Americans, but the rising cost of a college education threatens to close those doors to lower-income families. Having worked at Husson University in Bangor, I know first-hand how critical financial aid is to students and their families,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cThis legislation would help students and their families determine which repayment system works best for them, and helps ensure that higher education is accessible to students.\u201d \u201cThe mess of federal student loan repayment programs only creates confusion for our 8 million student borrowers, causing more borrowers to fall behind on their payments or go into default,\u201d said Senator Alexander, Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \u201cThis plan from Senators Burr and King will make the process of student loan repayments simpler and more manageable for our college graduates.\u201d Current graduates face a maze of federal student loan repayment programs from which to choose that often leave students confused about which program best fits their needs. In addition, due to years of changing eligibility terms and the introduction of new programs, little has been done to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not misdirected in subsidizing borrowers who do not need additional assistance. The Repay Act addresses those issues to make loan repayment more affordable for the middle class by eliminating duplicative repayment options, streamlining eligibility terms, and ensuring that borrowers will never direct more than 15 percent of their discretionary income to their loan payments. The proposal also ends the disproportionate federal subsidization of loan payments for high income borrowers and sets parameters for the amount of debt that can be forgiven over certain periods of time. \u00a0Importantly, the Repay Act also eliminates a provision in the tax code that requires borrowers whose loans are forgiven due to total and permanent disability to pay tax on the discharged debt. These are commonsense changes supported by broad groups of stakeholders who want to see these programs become sustainable and user-friendly. This legislation is estimated to save taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars over the next decade. To read more about the Repay Act, click  , and to see the full legislative text, click  . ###"},

{"title": "\u201c40 Hours Is Full Time\u201d", "date": ["Posted Fri, 01/16/2015 - 17:10"], "release": "Effective health care reform should provide Americans with access to quality and affordable care while also encouraging economic growth. Unfortunately, flaws in the Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d are discouraging employers from hiring and are resulting in part-time workers having their hours reduced and thus their paychecks cut. The problem is that Obamacare defines a \u201cfull-time\u201d employee as one who works just 30 hours a week. To protect workers, I have reintroduced the bipartisan \u201cForty Hours is Full Time Act,\u201d along with Senator Joe Donnelly (D-IN), to define \u201cfull time\u201d work as the standard 40 hours per week. This common-sense legislation is consistent with the standard for overtime eligibility under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the usual understanding of \u201cfull-time\u201d work. Our bill would help ensure that millions of American workers do not have their hours, and their paychecks, reduced. The employees affected by this rule aren\u2019t limited to any one sector. School employees, restaurant staff, seasonal employees, home care nurses, municipal workers, and many more, are all in danger of seeing their hours and paychecks cut. Among those at risk, I am concerned that educators, school employees, and students will be particularly hard hit. As the ASAA \u2013 \u201cThe School Superintendents Association\u201d \u2013 explained in its letter in support of our bill, Obamacare\u2019s 30-hour threshold puts an \u201cundue burden on school systems across the nation, many of [which] will struggle to staff their schools to meet their educational mission\u201d while complying with this requirement. For example, the school superintendent in Bangor has told me that Obamacare will require the school district to reduce the hours of substitute teaches to make sure they don\u2019t exceed 29 hours a week. This will harm not only the substitute teachers who want and need more work, but it will also harm students by causing a revolving door of substitutes. And with more than 100 school districts nationwide reportedly already having cut their workers\u2019 hours to 29 hours-a-week or fewer, this trend isn\u2019t just limited to Maine. During a news conference in Washington, Tom Snyder, President of Ivy Tech Community College in Indiana, told us about the unintended consequences of this law. In an effort to keep tuition affordable, his school employs more than 4,000 adjunct faculty members this semester alone. They are a valuable resource and bring real-life experiences into the classroom. But because the law requires them to also count the time these teachers spend preparing for class, they are now limiting their adjunct professors to teaching just nine hours a week. If they don\u2019t limit the hours, the school faces an overall health care bill of more than ten million dollars, which it cannot afford. I\u2019ve also heard from a central Maine municipality that this provision has crippled their ability to manage their employees\u2019 schedules and has resulted in the town laying off employees for a period of time. Generally, because the town\u2019s seasonal employees work more than 40 hours per week during the summer months, the town has kept these employees on part-time during the winter in different departments. However, because this would bring the employees over an average of 30 hours per week for the year, and thus require the town to offer them coverage, the town lays the employees off and then is required to pay them unemployment during the layoff period. This creates instability and uncertainty for both the town and its employees as well as lower pay for the employees. The 30-hour threshold will also harm delivery of home care services. As Lisa Harvey-McPherson, a registered nurse and board member of the Home Care and Hospice Alliance of Maine, explained during a news conference in Washington, the requirement will likely result in reduced access to needed services for some of our nation\u2019s most vulnerable citizens: home-bound seniors, individuals with disabilities, and recently discharged hospital and nursing home patients. As Lisa explained, many of the Home Care and Hospice Alliance member organizations will be forced to reduce work hours for employees or even to cease operations due to the definition of \u201cfull time\u201d work. If that happens, hundreds of home care workers could lose their jobs, and a thousand seniors and disabled people could lose access to home care services \u2013 and that\u2019s just in Maine alone. The onerous penalties under Obamacare are a powerful incentive for employers to refrain from hiring additional workers and will force some businesses to reluctantly reduce the hours of their workers. Under this troubling trend, more workers will find their hours and their earnings reduced or their jobs lost. Regardless of varying views on the Affordable Care Act, surely there is one thing we ought to be able to agree on: to fix this problem in the law that is hurting workers\u2019 paychecks and creating chaos for our nation\u2019s job creators."},
{"title": "Collins To Participate In Bipartisan Civil Rights Pilgrimage To Selma, Alabama", "date": ["Posted Mon, 01/19/2015 - 13:37"], "release": "ORONO, Maine\u00a0\u2013 At this morning\u2019s\u00a019th annual\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Martin Luther King, Jr. breakfast,\u00a0sponsored by the University of Maine and the Greater Bangor NAACP, Senator Susan Collins announced today that she will travel to Selma, Alabama on the 50th anniversary of \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d to participate in the Bipartisan Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage. The trip will commemorate the famous civil rights march that led to the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. \n\u00a0 \nSenator Collins\u00a0was\u00a0invited by\u00a0U.S. Senator\u00a0Tim Scott\u00a0(R-SC), the first African-American Senator elected from the south since 1881, and the bipartisan delegation will be led by Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, who participated in the original Selma March in 1965. \n\u00a0 \nThe commemoration will take place March 6-8, 2015 in Selma and Montgomery, Alabama, and will involve visits to historic sites and church services. \n\u00a0 \nDuring this morning\u2019s event, Senator Collins delivered the following remarks in honor of Martin Luther King Day: \n\u00a0 \n\u201cIt is a pleasure to join with you this morning to celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In this 50th\u00a0anniversary of the historic Selma March, Dr. King\u2019s dream of justice and equality for\u00a0all\u00a0Americans marches on. \n\u00a0 \n\u201cWhat is known today as the Selma March was actually a three-stage battle between hatred and humanity. It began on \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d -- March 7, 1965 \u2013 when the Reverend Hosea Williams and a young civil rights activist named John Lewis led a group of 600 toward the Alabama capital of Montgomery to protest racial discrimination in voting. After just six blocks, they were met on the now infamous Edmund Pettus Bridge by state and local police and attacked with clubs and tear gas. \n\u00a0 \n\u201cTwo days later, Dr. King led a symbolic march to the bridge. Approximately 3,200 marchers set out again from Selma on March 21. By the time they reached Montgomery five days and 54 miles later, their number had grown to more than 25,000. Within five months, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law, the perfect tribute to the courage and conviction of so many. \n\u00a0 \n\u201cI have an exciting announcement to make. This March, I will travel to Selma as a member of the Bipartisan Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage. I will have the honor to march and stand alongside that same John Lewis -- now\u00a0Congressman\u00a0John Lewis \u2013 and with Senator Tim Scott, the first African-American Senator elected from the South since 1881. We will stand on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. That notorious bridge, named for a Confederate General and Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon, is now a National Historic Landmark. \n\u00a0 \n\u201c2015 is the 60th\u00a0anniversary of two notable mileposts in the march to justice. In 1955, a tired seamstress refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus. Rosa Parks, however, was not tired from working. She was tired of racism and segregation. The bus boycott, inspired by this brave woman and led by a young Baptist minister named Martin Luther King, Jr., helped bring to an end the Jim Crow laws that made daily life in the South so demeaning for so many. \n\u00a0 \n\u201cIn the summer of that year,\u00a0Emmett Till was a fun-loving African-American youngster, just past his 14th\u00a0birthday, who was visiting family in Mississippi. His brutal murder was followed by a gross miscarriage of justice that allowed his murderers to go free. \n\u00a0 \n\u201cEmmett Till\u2019s death helped to awaken America. When his mutilated body was returned home to Chicago, his mother made the courageous decision to hold a public funeral service with an open casket so that all Americans would see the horror spawned by hatred. The marches, protests, and legislation that followed were a peaceful and powerful response to an act of utter savagery. \n\u00a0 \n\u201cThis past November, I sponsored the planting of a tree on the Capitol Grounds in the memory of Emmett Till. This living memorial was inspired by the efforts of Janet Langhart Cohen, the African-American author who is married to one of my inspirations in public service, Bangor\u2019s own Senator Bill Cohen. \n\u00a0 \n\u201cThere could be no more powerful symbols of the spirit of this day than a bridge and a tree, for we all are on a journey of growth. As we walk together, and as we plant and nurture together, we strengthen our shared commitment to a future of greater understanding, reconciliation, and justice.\u201d \n\u00a0 \n###"},

{"title": "Collins, King, Reed Lead Bipartisan Coalition Of Senators Seeking To Boost LIHEAP Fuel Assistance", "date": ["Posted Wed, 01/21/2015 - 13:13"], "release": "WASHINGTON, DC \u2013\u00a0In an effort to help provide fuel assistance to households struggling with their winter heating bills, U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Angus King (I-ME) and Jack Reed (D-RI) are once again leading the effort to restore and increase federal heating assistance to low-income families and seniors to past years\u2019 levels. Collins and Reed are leading a bipartisan coalition of 43 U.S. Senators, including King, in urging the President to provide Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) at no less than $4.7 billion.\u00a0 Last year, Senators Reed and Collins successfully led the effort, with Sen. King\u2019s support, to increase funding for LIHEAP by $169 million as part of the 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which the President signed into law in January.\u00a0 The (FY) 2015 Omnibus Appropriations Bill passed by Congress this week provides $3.39 billion in LIHEAP funding through September 30, 2015. \nLIHEAP is the main federal program that helps low-income households and seniors with their energy bills, providing vital assistance during both the cold winter and hot summer months. \u00a0LIHEAP households are among the most vulnerable in the country. \u00a0According to the National Energy Assistance Director's Association, more than 90 percent of LIHEAP recipients have at least one household member who is a child, elderly, or disabled, and 20 percent of households include at least one veteran. The current funding level is able to serve just 20 percent of the eligible population, and those who receive LIHEAP assistance have seen their average grant reduced by nearly $100 since 2010, from $520 in FY 2010 to $424 in FY 2014.\u00a0 With the average LIHEAP grant estimated to cover less than half of the average home heating costs for a household this winter, many low-income families and seniors will struggle to pay for the basic necessity of home energy and will have fewer resources available to meet other essential needs. \u201cThe LIHEAP program is one of our most effective tools to help senior citizens and less-fortunate households keep warm during the winter,\u201d\u00a0said Senator Collins.\u00a0 \u201cEnergy costs remain high and LIHEAP funding is a vital lifeline that helps prevent people from having to choose between heating their home, paying their bills, or going without food or medicine.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cMaine\u2019s bitterly cold winters present serious challenges for our state\u2019s most vulnerable families, who often end up having to confront the choice of whether to pay the ever-increasing heating bill or provide for everyday necessities,\u201d Senator King said. \u201cI urge the Administration to\u00a0include\u00a0these critical funds, which will help tens of thousands of Mainers to stay warm while still being able to make ends meet.\u201d \u201cFunding for LIHEAP is not keeping up with demand.\u00a0 We are doing everything we can to stretch these federal dollars, but more families are in need and we need to protect them during the cold winter months.\u00a0 We must keep the pressure on this Administration to robustly fund this critical program so that thousands of families can keep their heat on in the winter.\u00a0 We must also continue making smart investments in weatherizing more homes to try to reduce both energy bills and fuel consumption,\u201d\u00a0said Senator Reed, noting that\u00a0LIHEAP helped about 34,000 Rhode Islanders with their energy bills last year. Text of the letter is provided below: President\u00a0 \nThe White House \n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC 20500 \nDear Mr. President, \nWe are writing to request that you prioritize the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) in your Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 budget proposal by including no less than $4.7 billion for this program that provides critical support to our most vulnerable citizens. LIHEAP is the main federal program that helps low-income households and seniors with their energy bills, providing vital assistance during both the cold winter and hot summer months. LIHEAP households are among the most vulnerable in the country. According to the National Energy Assistance Director's Association, more than 90 percent of LIHEAP recipients have at least one household member who is a child, elderly, or disabled, and 20 percent of households include at least one veteran. For these households, LIHEAP funding has been a lifeline during challenging economic times. Access to affordable home energy is not a luxury. It is a matter of health and safety. We understand the ongoing discretionary budget challenges. However, we are deeply concerned that the number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance continues to exceed available funding while the average cost of home heating is expected to remain unaffordable for millions of households nationwide. In fact, the current funding level is able to serve just 20 percent of the eligible population, and those who receive LIHEAP assistance have seen their average grant reduced by nearly $100 since 2010, from $520 in FY 2010 to $424 in FY 2014. Additionally, the purchasing power of LIHEAP has declined in recent years. Since FY 2010, the average LIHEAP grant has fallen from about 60 percent to 44 percent of the cost of home heating. For households using delivered fuels, this decline is even more dramatic, covering just 18 percent of heating oil and propane costs. With the average LIHEAP grant estimated to cover less than half of the average home heating costs for a household this winter, many low-income families and seniors will struggle to pay for the basic necessity of home energy and will have fewer resources available to meet other essential needs. As you finalize your FY 2016 budget request, we ask that you take into account the high demand for LIHEAP assistance.

{"title": "Bangor Superintendent Dr. Betsy Webb Joins Senator Collins To Testify On Impact Of ACA's 30-Hour Rule", "date": ["Posted Thu, 01/22/2015 - 18:16"], "release": "Washington, D.C. \u2013 In a hearing before the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, & Pensions Committee, Dr. Betsy Webb, Superintendent of the Bangor School Department, testified to members of the Committee about the unintended consequences within her school district of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s current rule defining full-time employment as 30 hours a week. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dr. Webb\u2019s testimony informed the Committee of the inadvertent effect the law is having on the district\u2019s students. Dr. Webb stated, \u201cThe ACA\u2019s definition of \u2018full-time\u2019 work will deprive the district of flexibility critical to its success. For example, the district has a core group of substitute teachers who work more than 30-hours a week filling in for teachers who are out for extended periods, such as maternity leave. These substitute teachers help maintain continuity in the classroom, which is so important to students. Bangor can\u2019t afford to offer health benefits to these substitutes, nor can Bangor afford the penalty for failing to do so. Unless something is done to fix the 30-hour rule, the district will be forced to reduce the hours of these substitute teachers.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Senators Collins and Joe Donnelly (D-IN) have introduced bipartisan legislation, the \u201c40 Hours is Full-Time Act,\u201d to change the definition of a \u201cfull-time employee\u201d under the ACA to someone who works an average of 40 hours a week. This measure would help ensure that American employees, like the hardworking faculty in the Bangor School District, do not have their hours, and their paychecks, reduced. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking from the Senate floor on Thursday, Senator Collins outlined the importance of the bill, noting that \u201cRaising the threshold for \u2018full-time\u2019 work to 40-hours a week is necessary not only to protect the paychecks of workers employed by private sector businesses, such as restaurant and hotel staff, but also to protect those who work in the public sector, such as substitute teachers, ed techs, and school bus drivers. The 30-hour rule will not only harm school staff who want and need more work, but it will also harm students by causing unnecessary disruption in the classroom.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A broad range of organizations support the \u201c40 Hours is Full-Time\u201d bill including the National Association for Home Care & Hospice (NAHC). In a letter, the organization revealed the impact the 30-Hour definition will have on services nationwide, including four out of five home care and hospice providers being unable to provide health benefits because they rely on government programs like Medicaid for payment, and because they provide services to individuals with limited incomes. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A recent ADP study shows that 88 percent of full-time workers already have access to health insurance through their employer. These workers won\u2019t be affected by this bill as their employers already provide coverage and will have no incentive to reduce their workers\u2019 hours to avoid the employer mandate. Part-time workers, however, are at greater risk of having their hours reduced. In fact, one study estimates that 2.6 million workers are at risk of having their hours cut because of the 30-hour rule and more than 450 employers have already cut work hours or staffing levels in response to the ACA\u2019s penalties.

{"title": "Collins, King Introduce Bill To Improve Access To Health Care Services For Rural Veterans", "date": ["Posted Fri, 01/23/2015 - 12:58"], "release": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King have introduced legislation \u2013 the Veterans Access to Community Care Act of 2015 \u2013 that would require the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to use its existing authority to offer community care to veterans who live more than 40 miles driving distance from the nearest VA medical facility that provides the type of care they need.\u00a0 \u201cMaine veterans often face barriers to accessing care, including long drives and dangerous winter weather.\u00a0 The VA should have implemented the Choice Program as Congress intended, which was to allow veterans to seek care within their local communities if the VA cannot provide the services they need within 40 miles,\u201d said Senator Collins.\u00a0 \u201cThis bill would relieve many veterans across the state who struggle with the time and effort it takes to drive to Togus for specialty care.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur veterans deserve accessible, high-quality medical care \u2013 even if that means it has to come from outside the VA system,\u201d Senator King said. \u201cIn Maine, we have seen remarkable success in allowing veterans to obtain services through local clinics, which is why the VA reform bill we passed last year placed an added emphasis on providing them with greater flexibility to get the care they need. However, the VA isn\u2019t implementing the law with the most important pieces \u2013 access and services \u2013 in mind. This bill would require them to do so, ensuring that veterans can obtain the medical services they need.\u201d In July 2014, the House and Senate passed the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 \u2013 comprehensive legislation to address VA wait-time manipulation and failure to provide timely, quality health care to veterans. The legislation also permitted veterans across the country to access non-VA community care if they live more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility or if their wait time for an appointment is more than 30 days by establishing the Choice Program, a pilot program. In implementing the law, the VA determined that the 40 miles criteria would not take into account driving distances or whether the VA facility within 40 miles of a veteran can provide the specific type of medical services a veteran requires. This legislation would correct this oversight by requiring the VA to utilize its existing referral authorities to furnish health care services to those who reside more than 40 miles driving distance from the closest VA facility that offers the specific medical service sought. Senators Collins and King join Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), and Steve Daines (R-Mont.) in introducing the Veterans Access to Community Care Act of 2015. The bill is supported and endorsed by the Eastern Maine Medical Center, the National Rural Health Association, the National Association of County Behavioral Health & Developmental Disability Directors, the National Association of Rural Mental Health, the National Council for Behavioral Health, and the National Guard Association of the United States.\u00a0\u00a0"},
{"title": "\u201cYear In Review\u201d", "date": ["Posted Fri, 01/23/2015 - 13:04"], "release": "President Obama recently delivered his \u201cState of the Union\u201d address where he spoke about our nation\u2019s progress and his vision for the coming year. As we as a country turn the page on 2014 and look to the future, I\u2019d like to reflect on some of my work from this past year and highlight my priorities for the year ahead. I am deeply honored to serve our great state of Maine in the United States Senate and will continue to work to bridge the partisan divide and to forge bipartisan solutions to the many challenges our nation faces. I am pleased to report a number of successes from this past year, including provisions from my \u201cSeven Point Plan for Maine Jobs.\u201d Some of my proposals to streamline job training programs and better match workers\u2019 skills with employers\u2019 needs were enacted as part of a workforce investment act. I helped secure promising manufacturing opportunities for our state\u2014from requiring the military to buy American-made athletic footwear for new recruits, just as it does for other uniform items, to an additional Department of Energy investment in the deepwater, offshore wind power project being developed by the University of Maine, Maine Maritime Academy, and private companies. For Maine agriculture, I succeeded in including the fresh, white potato in a federal nutrition program from which it has been the only vegetable to be excluded. Also last year, I was pleased to join in the christening of the Zumwalt at Bath Iron Works, a Navy ship for the 21st Century that will help protect our nation and that reflects the extraordinary skills of men and women in one of Maine\u2019s most vital industries. And, for Veterans living in rural areas, I secured a two-year extension of the successful Access Received Closer to Home program, which is improving access to health care for Veterans in northern Maine. Finally, after several years in the making, I am delighted that Congress has approved my legislation to form a commission \u2013 at no cost to taxpayers \u2013 to plan a National Women\u2019s History Museum. A museum recognizing the contributions of American women is long overdue, and this bill is an important first step toward that goal. The biggest challenge facing our State remains the need for more jobs so that Mainers can stay in our State to live, work, and raise their families. Since small businesses create the vast majority of jobs, we must help them to start up, grow, and succeed. We must update our tax code to encourage small business investment in equipment and other assets, cut the red tape that is hampering job creators, build the transportation and energy infrastructure to support an expanding economy. We must also foster opportunities for key industries, from agriculture to defense. We must ensure that our workers have the skills they need for the jobs of today and tomorrow. These initiatives will remain my top priorities. In the new Congress, I serve as Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee.\u00a0 This position allows me to continue working to ensure investments are made in critical transportation infrastructure, which is essential for our safety and economic growth.\u00a0 To date, Maine has received more than $90 million for highway, bridge, airport, rail, and port projects through the successful TIGER grant program. I also serve at the helm of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, a position I sought because Maine has the highest median age in the nation. Working to address pressing issues facing our seniors, from long-term care and retirement security to the vast potential of biomedical research, will be on our agenda. Preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's should be an urgent national priority as this devastating disease continues to take such a personal and economic toll on more than five million Americans and their families. The Committee will also continue to focus on the scams and frauds targeting our senior citizens and has a toll-free hotline (1-855-303-9470) where seniors and their loved ones can report suspected fraud. A Maine value that always guides me is our unsurpassed work ethic. As 2014 ended, I continued my record of never missing a roll-call vote since my Senate service began in 1997, a tally that now stands at more than 5,700 consecutive votes. I am grateful for the opportunity to serve the great State of Maine and look forward to continued work on your behalf as your Senator."},

This year, I was delighted to participate in a wonderful Veterans Day Education and Appreciation Celebration at Stearns Junior/Senior High School in Millinocket, and to march in the Portland Veterans\u2019 Day parade.\u00a0 These ceremonies always remind me of my childhood when my father, a World War II veteran, would bring me to the parade in my hometown of Caribou where I learned of the sacrifices made by our veterans. It is estimated that some 48 million Americans have served in uniform since the founding of our nation.\u00a0 Today, more than 22 million veterans live among us, more than 127,000 right here in Maine.

We repay that debt in part with the gratitude we express on Veterans Day, but only in part.\u00a0 As a nation, we must also repay our debt with the health care, rehabilitation services, educational and employment opportunities our veterans have earned by their service. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), roughly 12 percent of the adult homeless population in our country is veterans.\u00a0 This is a problem that, as a leader of the Senate Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked to address through funding the Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) voucher program which combines rental assistance for homeless vets with case management and clinical services provided by the VA.\u00a0 The annual funding of $75 million provides approximately 10,000 new vouchers each year. I\u2019m pleased to report that we are making real progress.\u00a0 The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recently released its annual Homeless Assessment Report which updates the progress in addressing homelessness.\u00a0 Since 2010, there has been a 33 percent decrease in the number of homeless veterans nationwide. It is the American character to answer the call of duty \u00a0\u00a0It is also the American character to be grateful to those who answer that call.\u00a0 It is because of our veterans and those who serve today that our country still stands tall, that our founding principles remain strong, and that people around the world who once knew nothing but tyranny now know the blessings of freedom.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0"},

Unfortunately, under current law a soldier must serve at least 8 years of active service as a commissioned officer in order to retire as a commissioned officer.\u00a0 Soldiers who serve 20 years total, but less than 8 years as commissioned officers are retired at their highest enlisted rank.\u00a0 While this requirement makes sense in the case of soldiers who choose to retire, are passed over for multiple promotions, or are forced to retire due to misconduct, none of those cases applies to the soldiers in question.\u00a0 On the contrary, Army Human Resources Command has explicitly acknowledged that E-SERB will separate fully qualified officers \u201cwho have rendered quality service to the nation.\u201d\u00a0 To demote these soldiers in retirement is an injustice that devalues their service and will materially disadvantage them and their families for the rest of their lives.  \u00a0  Rather than forcing these officers to retire as soon as they reach 20 years of service, the Army could modify its E-SERB policy to delay the mandatory retirement date of affected soldiers until the first month after they become eligible to retire as commissioned officers.\u00a0 For many of the affected soldiers this would extend their time in service by only a few months.\u00a0 We strongly urge you to take the necessary steps to rectify this situation in order to allow these soldiers to retire at the rank they have earned and appropriately honor their service to our nation.\u00a0   \u00a0 ###"},

However, the report raises serious concerns about the CIA\u2019s management of this detention and interrogation program and the treatment of certain detainees. Torture is wrong and fundamentally contrary to American values. The report should be made public to allow the American people to reach their own conclusions and to make sure lessons are learned from the mistakes made so that they never happen again.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In April 2014, Senator Collins was one of three Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee who voted in the committee to declassify the report. She authored additional views which are appended to the report released today. They are as follows: \u00a0 SENATOR COLLINS\u2019 ADDITIONAL VIEWS AS APPENDED TO SENATE INTELLIGENCE REPORT \u201cThe use of torture is deplorable and is completely contrary to our values as Americans. For as long as I have served in the Senate, I have cast votes in opposition to torture and inhuman treatment of detainees. I cosponsored and voted in favor of Senator John McCain\u2019s Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, which banned \u201ccruel, inhuman, and degrading\u201d treatment of any prisoner in the custody of any U.S. government agency, and I supported the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which bolstered the Detainee Treatment Act\u2019s prohibition on abusive interrogations. \u201cThe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) Review of the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s (CIA\u2019s) Detention and Interrogation Program devotes much of its report to supporting its judgment that enhanced interrogation techniques (EITs) were ineffective in acquiring intelligence. While I agree with the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s (CIA\u2019s) current position that it is \u201cunknowable\u201d whether or not its \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d elicited significant intelligence that would not otherwise have been obtained, the fact remains that torture is wrong. The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which the United States ratified in 1994, is clear: \u201cNo exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.\u201d \u201cThe method by which the SSCI report was produced was unfortunate, to say the least, and will cause many to question its findings. In my years of service on the traditionally bipartisan Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), the Senate\u2019s chief oversight committee, the congressional reports I have coauthored have almost always been the result of collaborative, bipartisan investigations. Indeed, even a subject as controversial as the treatment of detainees can lead to the production of a strong bipartisan report, as demonstrated by the Senate Armed Services Committee\u2019s Inquiry into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody drafted by Chairman Carl Levin and Ranking Member John McCain and approved by voice vote in November 2008. When I joined the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in January 2013, I was disappointed to learn that the Committee\u2019s investigation into the CIA\u2019s Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation (RDI) program had not been conducted in a similarly bipartisan manner. \u201cSince joining the Committee, I have sought to compensate for this missed opportunity and have encouraged greater dialogue among the CIA and the majority and minority Committee staff members, and extensive conversations have indeed occurred. Following the delivery of the CIA\u2019s feedback to the Committee\u2019s report in June 2013, I asked that we hold a hearing prior to a vote to declassify this report that would have included CIA witnesses. Such a hearing would have permitted a robust and much-needed debate about the claims made in the report compared to the rebuttals in the Agency\u2019s formal response. Unfortunately, this hearing did not occur. \u201cIn the absence of a formal Committee hearing, I was briefed directly by veteran, career CIA analysts who provided feedback on the report\u2019s factual accuracy and analytical quality. Two Senators from both sides of the aisle joined me in this worthwhile briefing. \u201cI also sought to improve the report by recommending revisions and greater precision in the Review\u2019s Findings & Conclusions, and I appreciate Chairman Feinstein incorporating some of my edits. \u201cIn addition to the partisan nature of the staff investigation, the report has significant intrinsic limitations because it did not involve direct interviews of CIA officials, contract personnel, or other Executive branch personnel. John Rizzo, one of the chief architects of the program, has stated publicly that he would have been happy to be interviewed, and he said a number of his colleagues would have as well. The absence of interviews significantly eroded the bipartisan cooperation that existed when the SSCI Review began and calls into question some of the report\u2019s analysis. \u201cThe lack of interviews violated the Committee\u2019s bipartisan Terms of Reference that were approved by an overwhelming 14-1 vote in March 2009. The Terms of Reference describe the purpose, scope, and methodology of the Review, and they include the following statement: \u201cThe Committee will use the tools of oversight necessary to complete a thorough review including, but not limited to, document reviews and requests, interviews, testimony at closed and open hearings, as appropriate, and preparation of findings and recommendations.\u201d Yet, there were no interviews, no hearings, and no recommendations. By comparison, the SASC\u2019s 2008 Inquiry into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody included 70 interviews, written responses from more than 200 individuals in response to written questions, two hearings, and at least two subpoenas. \u201cDocuments never tell the full story and lack context. As the former Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate\u2019s chief investigative committee for ten years, I found that interviews were always key sources of information for every investigation our Homeland Security Committee conducted. In the 2012 HSGAC investigation into the attacks in Benghazi, for example, we discovered one of our most alarming findings in a discussion with the Commander of U.S. Africa Command, General Carter Ham. We learned that he was unaware of the presence of CIA officers in Benghazi, despite the fact that his Command had responsibility to prepare for the evacuation of U.S. government personnel. \u201cThe bipartisan Terms of Reference also called for the production of policy recommendations, but not one is included in the Review\u2019s Findings & Conclusions or its Executive Summary. Ironically, it was the CIA, rather than the Committee, that first developed recommendations to address the mismanagement, misconduct, and flawed performance that characterized too much of the CIA\u2019s Detention & Interrogation program. I have identified several recommendations that should be implemented as soon as possible. \u201cDespite these significant flaws, the report\u2019s findings lead me to conclude that some detainees were subjected to techniques that constituted torture. This inhumane and brutal treatment never should have occurred. \u201cThe Review also raises serious concerns about the CIA's management of this program. I particularly agree with its conclusions that the CIA was not prepared to conduct the RDI program, that the CIA failed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of the use of EITs, that the CIA rarely held officers accountable for misconduct and mismanagement related to the RDI program, and that the CIA allowed a conflict of interest to exist among contractors responsible for too much of the RDI program. Is there any function that could be more inherently governmental than the questioning of high-level al Qaeda detainees in CIA custody? Yet, the CIA relied heavily on contractors for its RDI program and even had contractors evaluate the program. \u201cThe Review\u2019s most significant finding deals with the ineffectiveness of EITs in collecting valuable intelligence. As a Senator who strongly opposes torture, I would have welcomed a well-documented finding that reached this judgment. Unfortunately, the evidence cited does not sustain the Review\u2019s categorical judgment that EITs were ineffective at acquiring valuable intelligence. \u201cFor example, the Review concedes that some detainees were subject to EITs so soon after their capture that it is impossible to determine whether the information they provided could have been obtained through non-coercive debriefing methods. Here the report gets it right: there is no way to know what information these particular detainees would have provided without the use of EITs because the detainees were not afforded that opportunity for very long. Yet, the report draws a different and much more definitive conclusion: EITs were categorically ineffective at acquiring valuable intelligence. \u201cIt is also striking to me that two highly experienced public servants who are both widely respected for their integrity and impartiality, examined the program at two different times, independently of each other, and they both rendered the same verdict regarding the effectiveness of EITs. In 2011, former CIA Director Leon Panetta, and in 2005, a well-regarded [redacted] both took the position that we simply can never know for sure if the information obtained from detainees who were subjected to EITs would have been obtained through other non-coercive means. \u201cA letter from then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta to Senator John McCain sums up his conclusion on the effectiveness of EITs with respect to the Osama bin Laden raid: \u201cSome of the detainees who provided useful information about the facilitator/courier\u2019s role had been subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques. Whether those techniques were the \u2018only timely and effective way\u2019 to obtain such information is a matter of debate and cannot be established definitively.\u201d According to the Review\u2019s own Executive Summary, [redacted] said the following about the effectiveness of the CIA\u2019s enhanced interrogation techniques: \u201chere enters the epistemological problem. We can never know whether or not this intelligence could have been extracted through alternative procedures.\u201d \u201cIt bears repeating that torture need not be ineffective to be wrong. The United States correctly answered the question of whether torture should be prohibited when our nation ratified the Convention against Torture in 1994. The prohibition against torture in both U.S. law and international law is not based on an evaluation of its efficacy at eliciting information. Rather, the prohibition was put in place because torture is immoral and contrary to our values. \u201cThere are three findings about the RDI program that warrant attention because they provide important perspective and context about the CIA program. \u201cFirst, even as mistreatment of detainees was occurring, senior CIA officials repeatedly sought legal approval from the Department of Justice (DOJ) in an effort to make sure each of the EITs employed by CIA officers did not constitute torture. For example, the CIA suspended the program and/or sought legal approval prior to conducting EITs on Abu Zabaydah and several times afterwards: in 2004 after a new attorney in DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), Jack Goldsmith, said the Department had never formally opined on whether EITs met constitutional standards, in 2005 when another attorney in OLC assessed OLC had not provided a substantive ruling on whether certain EITs violated portions of the Convention Against Torture, after passage of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, and after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld and the passage of the Military Commissions Act of 2006. \u201cSecond, the problems of the detention program were frequently whole-of-government failures, not just CIA\u2019s alone. Legal opinions issued by OLC are almost never withdrawn, especially by the same Administration that issued them. Yet, that is exactly what happened in this case. Why was the original legal analysis by the Department of Justice so inadequate regarding such an important issue? CIA should not have made definitive claims about the effectiveness of EITs, but independent of the material facts provided by CIA, the withdrawal of the original August 1, 2002, OLC classified legal analysis demonstrated that it was too flawed and lacked the legal rigor necessary to serve as the basis for a controversial and questionable program. \u201cThird, the Review\u2019s Findings & Conclusions understate the degree to which the U.S. Government failed to focus on an end game for CIA detainees in the program by not moving them to military installations, even as the CIA repeatedly sought to move the detainees out of its custody in 2005 after many had ceased producing valuable intelligence. \u201cIn the absence of recommendations in the SSCI\u2019s report, I believe four actions should be taken to prevent the awful mistakes in the CIA\u2019s RDI program from ever happening again. (1) Outlaw waterboarding of detainees once and for all. President Obama implemented this policy when he took office by signing Executive Order 13491, which requires all government agencies, not just the Department of Defense, to adhere to the techniques in the Army Field Manual 2-22.3. Codifying this prohibition would make this restriction even more explicit than the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. I voted in favor of the Fiscal Year 2008 Intelligence Authorization Act in February 2008, which would have restricted the interrogation techniques employed by CIA personnel to only those covered in the Army Field Manual. Unfortunately, this legislation was vetoed on March 8, 2008. (2) Reduce the number of programs now shared exclusively with the Gang of Eight, which consists of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the intelligence committees and the leadership of both chambers of Congress, so more members of the oversight committees have access to significant information. Congress was informed about the RDI program to the bare minimum required by the National Security Act and no further. Most members of the intelligence committees, not to mention the rest of Congress, officially learned about the program on the same day President Bush announced it to the world in September 2006. In this case, adherence to the letter of the law rather than the spirit of the law resulted in insufficient oversight. As former CIA attorney John Rizzo has said: The decision in 2002 to limit congressional knowledge of the EITs to the Gang of 8 and to stick to that position for four long years\u2014 as the prevailing political winds were increasingly howling in the other direction\u2014 was foolish and feckless\u2026For our part, we in the CIA leadership should have insisted at the outset that all members of the intelligence committees be apprised of all the gory details all along the way, on the record, in closed congressional proceedings. (3) Strengthen the review process at the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) for legal opinions concerning sensitive intelligence activities. The Intelligence Community (IC) requires and deserves to have confidence that OLC can produce valid, durable legal analysis upon which it can rely. At the same time, the IC needs to inform OLC if material facts related to sensitive programs that have previously been reviewed have changed. (4) Improve CIA controls in the management [redacted]. The unauthorized use of EITs beyond those approved by DOJ OLC, along with the many shortcomings in CIA\u2019s management of the RDI program, require CIA to implement greater and more detailed controls regarding sensitive programs. \u201cMy vote to declassify this report does not signal my endorsement of all of its conclusions or its methodology. I do believe, however, that the Executive Summary, and Additional and Minority Views, and the CIA's rebuttal should be made public with appropriate redactions so the American public can reach their own conclusions about the conduct of this program. In my judgment, the \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d led, in some instances, to inhumane and brutal treatment of certain individuals held by the United States government.\u201d # # #"},

The bill contains provisions, authored by Senator Collins and overwhelmingly approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee in June, to improve safety on our nation\u2019s roadways and to study the impacts of federal regulations forcing trucks to drive during crowded, morning rush hour times rather than overnight when the roads are less congested. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cI have worked hard to improve Maine\u2019s, and our nation\u2019s, transportation system by ensuring that taxpayer dollars are appropriately invested in our infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports, and railroads, which creates good-paying jobs and benefits our economy,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cIn addition, this bill will help ensure that individuals and families have access to affordable and safe housing, including funding to help individuals break the cycle of homelessness, and it includes a significant investment in the Community Development Block Grant program to help communities nationwide address a wide range of unique community and economic development needs.\u201d Highlights of the FY2015 THUD funding bill include: Transportation \u2022 $500 million to continue supporting critical transportation infrastructure investments through the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery, or TIGER, grant program. Senator Collins is a strong advocate for the TIGER program. She has fought for robust funding since it was established in 2009. She has strongly supported Maine\u2019s applications under the TIGER program, resulting in more than $90 million for projects in the state, including key projects such as the replacements of bridges in Kittery, Dresden-Richmond, and Rumford, and the breakwater in Eastport. Maine has received funding in every round of the highly competitive program. \u2022 The bill provides additional resources for the safe transportation of crude oil and other energy products, including funds to support web-based HAZMAT training, a provision Senator Collins strongly advocated for in the wake of the horrendous rail accident in Lac-Megantic, Quebec in July 2013. \u2022 The bill continues to advance and modernize our nation\u2019s aviation systems while keeping rural communities connected to the transportation network. \u2022 The bill contains a provision authored by Senator Collins, and approved by a bipartisan 21 to 9 vote by the Senate Appropriations Committee in June, to temporarily suspend two new restrictions imposed on commercial motor vehicle drivers that mandate two consecutive rest periods between 1am and 5am, and limit the use of the \u201crestart\u201d to just once per week. These two regulations are suspended for one year during which the Secretary of the Department of Transportation will conduct a study of the operational, safety, health, and fatigue impacts of these regulations. Since first implemented last year, these regulations have forced large trucks onto roads during daytime rush hour, which is statistically the riskiest time of day for crashes. Former administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) Annette Sandberg says this temporary suspension \u201cmakes the roads safer.\u201d The National Fraternal Order of Police says the change \u201conly makes sense from a public safety perspective.\u201d \u201cI care deeply about safety on our nation\u2019s roads, and no one wants to see an accident caused by driver fatigue or by any other cause. What has become clear is that new federal rules, implemented last year, have presented some unintended and unanticipated consequences that are not in the best interest of public safety, truck drivers, or the businesses and consumers who depend on their services,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cDespite misinformation being circulated, this provision does not impose or propose a permanent repeal of the hours of service regulations, nor does it suspend all of the changes to the hours of service regulations that were implemented in July 2013 as others have proposed. This provision does not change the maximum number of hours per day that a driver can be behind the wheel. It does not change the mandatory 30-minute meal or rest break during a shift. It does not change the total on-duty hours in each shift. It does not change the minimum off-duty hours required between shifts or the requirement that will be implemented for electronic onboard recorders. \u201cWhat this provision, that was debated and approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee, does do however, is provide temporary relief from two provisions of the hours of service regulations that prevent a driver from driving between 1am and 5am for two consecutive nights and prohibits drivers from taking a 34-hour restart more than once a week. There is increasing concern that these regulations are forcing more trucks on the road during the most congested morning hours \u2013 during a time when commuters are traveling to work and children are traveling to school.\u201d Housing \u2022 The bill continues funding important programs that have helped reduce homelessness across the country. Since 2010, veterans\u2019 homelessness has decreased by 33 percent and chronic homelessness by 21 percent. More than $2.2 billion is provided for Homeless Assistance Grants and approximately 10,000 new housing vouchers for homeless veterans. Additionally, the bill directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development to work with communities to promote youth-appropriate housing options and emphasize youth housing as a part of its annual homeless funding competition. \u2022 Section 202 Housing for the Elderly renewals are fully funded to ensure all existing properties are supported. \u2022 $3 billion is provided for the Community Development Block Grant program to support state and local economic development efforts. ###"},

This funding has been an indispensable lifeline during challenging economic times, helping to ensure that recipients do not have to choose between paying their energy bills and paying for other necessities like food or medicine. On average, low-income families and seniors spend a higher proportion of their income on energy, and for many states, October marks the start of the heating season, creating an additional constraint on these household budgets.  \u00a0  As the relevant state agencies begin to provide assistance for this winter, it is critical that they have the resources to assist low-income households and seniors as soon as possible. Therefore, we request that you quickly release LIHEAP funds and at as high of a level as possible in order to allow states and low-income households to prepare for the upcoming season.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0  We look forward to continuing to work with you on this critical program, and thank you for your attention to our concerns and those of our constituents.  \u00a0  Sincerely,  \u00a0  Reed (D-RI)  Collins (R-ME)  Ayotte (R-NH)  Baldwin (D-WI)  Blumenthal (D-CT)  Booker (D-NJ)  Boxer (D-CA)  Brown (D-OH)  Begich (D-AK)  Cantwell (D-WA)  Cardin (D-MD)  Casey (D-PA)  Coons (D-DE)  Durbin (D-IL)  Franken (D-MN)  Gillibrand (D-NY)  Harkin (D-IA)  Heitkamp (D-ND)  Hirono (D-HI)  Johnson, Tim (D-SD)  Kaine (D-VA)  King (I-ME)  Klobuchar (D-MN)  Landrieu (D-LA)  Leahy (D-VT)  Levin (D-MI)  Manchin (D-WV)  Markey (D-MA)  Merkley (D-OR)  Menendez (D-NJ)  Mikulski (D-MD)  Murkowski (R-AK)  Murphy (D-CT)  Murray (D-WA)  Pryor (D-AR)  Rockefeller (D-WV)  Sanders (I-VT)  Schatz (D-HI)  Schumer (D-NY)  Shaheen (D-NH)  Stabenow (D-MI)  Tester (D-MT)  Walsh (D-MT)  Warren (D-MA)  Whitehouse (D-RI)  Wyden (D-OR)"},

Thomas Perez  Secretary  U.S. Department of Labor  200 Constitution Ave., NW  Washington, DC 20210  \u00a0  Dear Mr. Secretary:  \u00a0  We are writing on behalf of more than 500 workers at Verso Paper Corporation in Bucksport, Maine, who are being displaced due to increased imports and foreign competition.\u00a0 A Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) application has been filed in accordance with TAA regulations, in an effort to assist the workers with much needed support and resources.  \u00a0  Verso is a leading North American producer of coated paper, including the lightweight coated groundwood and specialty papers produced at the Bucksport mill.\u00a0 However, due to shrinking demand attributable to foreign competition, Verso Paper Corporation is being forced to scale back its annual production and, consequently, its workforce. Given the rural location of the paper company, and the significant loss of jobs throughout Maine\u2019s pulp and paper industry in recent years, the laid off workers face a monumental hurdle in identifying and securing alternative employment.\u00a0 Since many related wood product manufacturers have already experienced closures as a result of similar declines in business due to foreign trade, including the closure of a mill in Old Town, Maine, in August, it is unlikely that these workers will find comparable positions, and they may require retraining for other emerging occupations.\u00a0 Thus, it is crucial that these workers receive certification under the TAA program.  \u00a0  We urge that you review this Trade Adjustment Assistance application in a timely manner, consistent with all rules and regulations, to ensure that the workers receive the assistance they need to obtain work and to help reduce the negative effects this action will have on their financial stability. This assistance is of paramount importance to us, the displaced workers, and the families they support.  \u00a0  Thank you for your time and consideration on behalf of the workers at Verso Paper Corporation in Bucksport, Maine.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0"},
{"title": "\u201cThe Season To Raise Awareness Of Senior Falls\u201d", "date": ["Posted Mon, 10/06/2014 - 11:45"], "release": "As Mainers, we appreciate the beauty of all four seasons in our state. There is nothing more spectacular, however, than fall in Maine with our fresh, crisp autumn air, harvest festivals, and foliage so brilliant that it attracts countless out-of-state visitors to take in the beauty that we see in our own backyards.\u00a0  The beginning of the fall season also marks \u201cNational Falls Prevention Awareness.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Along with Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), I have cosponsored a bipartisan resolution that designated the first day of autumn as \u201cNational Falls Prevention Awareness Day.\u201d This is the fourth year in a row that I have cosponsored this resolution. The National Council on Aging (NCOA) has designated this year\u2019s falls prevention theme as \u201cStrong Today, Falls Free Tomorrow\u201d to help promote awareness and educate seniors and their families about ways to prevent falls.  The reality is that falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries among older adults. One of three older Americans will fall and become injured each year.\u00a0\u00a0 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the death rate from falls among older adults has risen sharply over the past decade.\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  In 2012, more than 2.4 million older adults were treated in emergency departments for falls, and nearly 22,000 will die annually from injuries related to falls.\u00a0\u00a0 Another alarming fact is that, according to the CDC, individuals over age 65 have the highest rates of death and hospitalizations due to traumatic brain injury (TBI).\u00a0 Falling is the leading cause of these head injuries.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The Senate Special Committee on Aging, of which I serve as Ranking Member, recently held a hearing to examine the link between traumatic brain injuries and neurological diseases. Some research is showing strong evidence that there is a link between moderate and severe TBI and a greater risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia, as well as ALS and Parkinson\u2019s Disease.\u00a0 One troubling study cited by the Alzheimer\u2019s Association found that older individuals with a history of moderate traumatic brain injury are more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease as seniors with no history of brain injury.  Falls take an enormous physical, emotional, and financial toll on our nation\u2019s seniors.\u00a0 In addition to the pain and suffering, falls can affect a senior\u2019s ability to live independently and can lead to a compromised qualify of life and thus, isolation and depression.\u00a0 In addition, many people who fall, even if they are not injured, can develop a fear of falling. This may cause them to limit their activities, resulting in reduced mobility and physical activity and even further increasing their risk of falling.  As outlined in our bipartisan Senate resolution, in 2010, the total direct medical cost of fall-related injuries for older adults was $30 billion.\u00a0 If the current rate of falls does not decrease, the CDC projects that the cost of injuries from falls could reach more than $67 billion by 2020. Given our nation\u2019s aging population and the increasing rate of fall-related injuries among seniors, it is critical that we raise awareness about this problem and ways to help prevent it.\u00a0  Evidence-based programs that emphasize cost-effective strategies\u2014such as exercise programs to improve strength and balance, medication management, vision improvement, and reduction in home hazards\u2014will play a key role in this effort.\u00a0 Awareness efforts, such as those of the National Council on Aging, the CDC, and local aging organizations, are vitally important.  For example, the CDC has available a checklist for things that older individuals can do to help prevent falls including:\u00a0 exercising regularly; having a doctor evaluate medications, including over-the-counter medications,\u00a0 as some medications can cause dizziness or tiredness; checking vision annually since poor vision can increase the risk of falling; and reducing home hazards by improving lighting.  There are many organizations throughout Maine, including several Agencies on Aging, that offer important fall awareness programs such as fall risk assessments and exercise and balance programs.  One of the biggest myths about falls is that they are a normal part of aging. They are not. \u00a0It is my hope that our bipartisan Senate resolution will help raise awareness of falls and in turn help reverse the dangerous trend of increasing senior falls. \u00a0"},
{"title": "Collins, Murphy Introduce Bipartisan Super Pollutants Act Of 2014", "date": ["Posted Fri, 09/19/2014 - 15:45"], "release": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Chris Murphy (D-CT) have been joined by several colleagues, including Senator Angus King (I-ME), in introducing the Super Pollutants Act of 2014 \u2013the first bipartisan climate bill of 2014, which aims to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). The legislation will help reduce SLCPs in the atmosphere by taking a number of steps to enable federal agencies to work with the business and non-profit communities to speed the adoption of SLCP-reducing technologies and policies, all while supporting American-led innovations. For example, the legislation would: \u2022 Foster interagency cooperation on super pollutants; \u2022 Prioritize commonsense emissions reduction strategies, and employ existing federal authorities and diplomatic programs; \u2022 Recycle high-global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants; \u2022 Mitigate methane leaks; \u2022 Expand access to diesel-scrubbing technologies. SLCPs, referred to as \u201csuper pollutants,\u201d are non-carbon dioxide greenhouse pollutants that cause 40 percent of global warming. SLCPs range from methane that is leaked by landfills and oil and gas exploration, to refrigerants leaking from refrigerators and air conditioners, to soot from diesel engines and millions of traditional cookstoves all over the developing world. Studies show that fast action to reduce SLCPs in the atmosphere could cut the rate of sea level rise by 25 percent, almost halve the rate of temperature rise, prevent two million premature deaths each year, and avoid crop losses of over 30 million tons annually. \"Climate change is a significant challenge that requires global solutions in order reduce greenhouse gas pollution worldwide,\u201d said Senator Collins. \u201cThe bipartisan legislation that I am introducing with Senator Murphy would address short-lived but significant climate pollutants, an area where the U.S. is already poised to be a leader. With improved interagency cooperation and through commonsense efforts to reduce the emissions of these \u201csuper pollutants,\u201d this proposal aims to meaningfully and quickly help slow climate change.\u201d \u201cWe have an environmental, economic, and moral imperative to address climate change, and we need to act now,\u201d Senator King said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more evident that SLCPs are responsible for nearly half of the emissions causing global warming, which means we have an easy first target. Our bipartisan bill will make it easier to bring together all the tools at our disposal by encouraging increased interagency cooperation and harnessing the power of new and emerging technologies.\u201d \u201cShort-lived climate pollutants are the problem too few people are talking about, but are doing some of the worst damage to the atmosphere,\u201d said Senator Murphy. \u201cAs we work to combat threats to our climate, we can\u2019t leave short-lived pollutants out of the equation. Our bill will take these dangerous pollutants head on by making smarter use of tools already at our disposal here in the United States. I\u2019m proud to lead this bipartisan proposal to address a global threat with Senator Collins and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it and help us reduce these super pollutants.\u201d In addition to Senator King, others who have cosponsored the legislation authored by Senators Collins and Murphy include Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR.), Chris Coons (D-DE), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA.) ###"},

I believe, however, that we must do more.  \u00a0  That\u2019s why Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and I have authored a bipartisan resolution declaring that the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer\u2019s by 2025 is an \u201curgent national priority.\u201d\u00a0 Our resolution recognizes that significant increases in research funding are necessary to meet that goal and resolves that Congress should strive to double the amount of funding the U.S. spends on research in 2015.\u00a0 The resolution also calls for the development of a plan to meet the target of $2 billion a year in funding for research as recommended by the experts on the federal Alzheimer\u2019s Advisory Council.\u00a0  \u00a0  Increasing our nation\u2018s investment to just one percent of what we are currently spending to care for Alzheimer\u2019s patients would make a real difference.  \u00a0  The resolution builds upon the National Alzheimer\u2019s Project Act, a law I authored four years ago.\u00a0 It requires the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a coordinated, strategic national plan to combat and effectively treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u00a0 This plan is updated annually and helps us focus our efforts and accelerate our progress toward better treatments, a means of prevention, and ultimately even a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s.

The report, requested by Senator Susan Collins and other leaders of the Senate Finance and Aging Committees as well as the House Ways and Means Committee, finds that the IRS should take additional steps to strengthen its pre-refund and anti-fraud efforts to effectively\u00a0stop tax refund fraud before it even starts. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Despite efforts to prevent tax refunds from being paid to con artists who have stolen the identities of taxpayers, the IRS paid $5.2 billion in refunds based on fraudulent tax returns in 2013,\u201d said U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), Ranking Member of the Senate Aging Committee. \u201cThese fraudulent tax refund payments waste taxpayer dollars and jeopardize the legitimate refunds of taxpayers.\u00a0 The IRS must do more to prevent fraudulent tax refunds from being paid to fraudsters rather than to their rightful claimant.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe American people should be able to trust the IRS to protect their identities, preserve their privacy, and ensure their hard-earned money isn\u2019t being carelessly flushed down the drain.\u00a0 Sadly, that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said Finance Committee Ranking Member Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). \u201cAs the GAO made clear today, there is more that can be done to improve the agency\u2019s anti-fraud capabilities.

Unemployment in our state, and across the country, remains too high. We must continue working together to identify ways to improve job training initiatives to help people find jobs in fields where jobs exist. I have met with many business owners here in Maine who have jobs available, but they cannot find qualified and trained workers to fill these vacant positions. One way for employees to acquire the skills needed to thrive in in-demand fields is through apprenticeship programs.\u00a0 Apprentices get hands-on experience that is invaluable to employers and can help workers secure a good-paying job.\u00a0 According to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, approximately 44,000 individuals graduated from apprenticeship programs in 2013 \u2013 nearly 1,000 of those individuals were from Maine.\u00a0 However, that number is likely insufficient to meet tomorrow\u2019s needs.\u00a0 One manufacturer in Maine estimates that nearly 2.7 million manufacturing employees are expected to retire in the next decade.\u00a0 We must do all we can to ensure that an adequate pool of skilled workers is available to fill these good-paying jobs. Along with Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), I have introduced legislation, the Apprenticeship and Jobs Training Act, that would\u00a0help achieve this goal by giving tax credits to businesses that hire apprentices.\u00a0 To ensure that workers are given adequate time to prove their value, the apprentice must be employed for seven months in order for a business to claim the credit.\u00a0 Our bill would also provide incentives for experienced workers who spend at least 20 percent of their time passing their hard-earned knowledge on to the next generation.\u00a0 These workers would be allowed to receive some retirement income early, without facing tax penalties.\u00a0 Finally, our bill would ensure that the brave men and women who defend our country are given credit for the skills they learn while serving.\u00a0 Training received while serving in the Armed Forces would count toward an apprentice\u2019s training requirement.

I would like to gain a better understanding of what your Administration is doing to protect Americans from the risks associated with Ebola and other infectious diseases.\u00a0 Specifically, I would appreciate clarification of the following issues: 1. \u00a0 \u00a0What action is the Administration taking to improve U.S. hospital protocols and training with regard to Ebola?\u00a0 2.\u00a0\u00a0 It is not reasonable to expect that each of the 5,000 hospitals in America will have the resources and properly trained personnel to care for an infected patient. \u00a0Is the Administration working with hospitals to designate state or regional centers where hospital personnel have the expertise, facilities, and equipment to quarantine and treat patients with Ebola and other infectious diseases? 3.\u00a0\u00a0 Multiple federal departments and agencies \u2013 ranging from the Department of Defense, to the Department of State, to the Department of Transportation and multiple agencies at the Departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security \u2013 have been involved in the Ebola response.\u00a0 Whom have you designated to coordinate the response among the multiple agencies involved? 4.\u00a0\u00a0 Points of entry into and out of the United States include multiple modes of transportation that are overseen by multiple federal agencies. a)\u00a0 What is the federal government doing specifically to ensure effective screening at all points of entry into the United States? b)\u00a0 Has the federal government provided proper Ebola screening tools and protection equipment to points of entry personnel? i.

{"title": "\"Not All Climate Pollutants Are Created Equal\"", "date": ["Posted Wed, 10/22/2014 - 11:01"], "release": "Publication:  Not all climate pollutants are created equal. While carbon dioxide shoulders a lot of the blame, it's not the only bad actor when it comes to the climate. Short-lived climate pollutants, or the soot, methane and refrigerants that we call \"super pollutants,\" can warm the climate at a rate thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide. To tackle this important and far-reaching problem, we've introduced bipartisan legislation called the Super Pollutants Act of 2014.  Why are these super pollutants important? When it comes to combating climate change, targeting them gets you the biggest bang for your buck. Cutting these pollutants alone could slow climate warming by as much as 0.5 degrees Celsius, avoid 2 million premature deaths each year and save 30 million tons of crops annually.  Although they persist in the atmosphere for a short time span when compared to CO2, these pollutants do a lot of damage while they're there. The most common refrigerant compound used in cars and refrigerators warms the climate at 1,300 times the rate of CO2. Soot, including the black carbon emitted from traditional cookstoves, can warm the climate over a thousand times faster than CO2. Methane warms the climate 34 times faster than CO2. As the developing world modernizes, emissions of all three of these pollutants are likely to skyrocket -- unless we do something.  These super pollutants can be tackled quickly and effectively. Furthermore, the U.S. is already a leader in the technologies needed to drive reductions. We are well-positioned to employ alternatives to the chemicals used in refrigeration and air conditioning, do a better job of replacing traditional cookstoves and diesel engines that generate soot, and harness fugitive methane seeping out of landfills, wastewater plants and pipelines.  Our legislation will help reduce super pollutants in our atmosphere by taking a number of steps to enable federal agencies to work with the business and nonprofit communities to speed the adoption of super pollutant-reducing technologies and policies, all while supporting American-led innovations to reduce these pollutants. Our legislation aims to foster interagency cooperation on super pollutants; prioritize commonsense, emissions-reduction strategies; and employ existing federal authorities and diplomatic programs through the recycling of high-global warming potential refrigerants, the mitigation of methane leaks, and expanding access to diesel-scrubbing technologies.  Taking these steps can save money, drive economic growth, and prevent death and disease around the world while helping to jump-start meaningful action on climate change. Calls for exporting clean diesel technologies and access to clean cookstoves are just two examples that have previously drawn bipartisan support.  The legislation's approach has been endorsed by interested stakeholders in both the business and nongovernmental organization communities. The director of the Climate and Clean Air Program at the National Resources Defense Council noted the need for \"adding legislative muscle to the fight to curb key pollutants\" such as methane. Similarly, United Technologies Building and Industrial Systems, a leading provider to building systems worldwide, stated that the proposal \"promotes both ozone protection and improved energy efficiency of newer systems.\" DuPont said the bill reflects \"the kinds of common sense approaches\" that both businesses and NGOs support. The Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy has also lauded the bill's use of \"market-oriented solutions\" to address super pollutants.  While we recognize how difficult it is to enact new policies, we hope that our legislation will raise awareness of these harmful super pollutants -- and signal that there's some bipartisan willingness to address them in a common-sense way.

While much progress remains to be made, we have witnessed great strides in the advancement of women in our own country and most of the developed world over the past century.\u00a0   Across vast swaths of the globe, however, the opportunities for women to advance in society are far fewer.\u00a0 Instead of having political, academic, or economic opportunities, they are faced with violence, forced marriages, and human rights abuses. In fact, one out of three women worldwide will be physically, sexually or otherwise abused during her lifetime, with rates reaching 70 percent in some countries.\u00a0 This kind of abhorrent violence ranges from domestic violence to rape and acid burnings to dowry deaths and so-called \u201chonor killings.\u201d\u00a0   Look no further than the conflict playing out in Syria and Iraq today.\u00a0 There, the utter barbarism perpetrated by the terrorist organization Islamic State (ISIL) has been on horrific display.\u00a0 Girls and women have been abducted from their homes and villages, sold into sexual slavery, and forced into marriages with ISIL fighters.\u00a0   In refugee camps and refugee-populated areas near Syria, women and girls are exposed to exploitation and harassment.\u00a0 With little economic opportunity and no way out, these families often arrange marriages for their daughters to protect them from sexual violence.\u00a0 Human Rights Watch has told the story of Zahra from Homs, who is the breadwinner for her family, but has been forced to leave three jobs because her employers tried to pressure her into sex.\u00a0 When she tried to report the incidents to a United Nations refugee caseworker, she was told there was nothing that could be done about it.\u00a0\u00a0  This systemic targeting of women, however, is not confined to the war-torn Middle East.\u00a0 The International Center for Research on Women says one in nine girls around the world is married before the age of 15, a harmful practice that deprives girls of their dignity and often their education, increases their health risks, and perpetuates poverty.\u00a0 In Nigeria, al-Qaeda affiliated Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 innocent schoolgirls this spring.\u00a0 The reason they were targeted? They were trying to get an education.\u00a0 The results of such widespread and deplorable practices will undoubtedly have repercussions for generations to come.\u00a0 \u00a0  Combatting this type of oppression against women and increasing their opportunities abroad has been a long-standing priority of mine.\u00a0 This year, I joined Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) in introducing the International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA), which ensures that the U.S. will take a leadership role in combating these problems.\u00a0\u00a0 This bill would establish that it is the policy of the United States to take action to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls around the globe and to coordinate efforts to address gender-based violence into U.S. foreign policy and foreign assistance programs.\u00a0   In addition, for the third year in a row, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved my request to designate up to $50 million of foreign aid to increase women's political participation in local and national governments around the world.\u00a0 Research shows that simple investments to increase equality for women will have an exponential effect on the prosperity of societies.\u00a0 According to the World Bank, increasing the number of women in elected office can contribute to reducing corruption that undermines the rule of law.\u00a0 In addition, female parliamentarians are more likely to advance legislation to protect human rights and promote economic growth, education, and health care for women.  I have seen first-hand the positive effects of greater political involvement on the part of women here in the United States, and I believe our nation can and must continue its leadership role in empowering women worldwide.\u00a0 In doing so, we will not only improve the lives of untold millions, but we will also create a more secure world for ourselves and future generations.

The American people do not want dysfunction in Washington to lead to another harmful government shutdown like the one we experienced last year, and allowing that to happen would only further jeopardize our still struggling economy. \u201cI am disappointed, however, that Senate leaders did not allow a full debate or hold a vote on an Authorization for the Use of Military Force or the President\u2019s overall strategy to confront the terrorist group known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL. \u201cISIL poses a serious threat to Iraq, to the region, to Americans both here at home and abroad, and to our allies as was demonstrated by the Australian plot uncovered today. We need an effective strategy that includes air strikes against ISIL, cutting off the group\u2019s financing, military contributions from other countries in the Middle East, and robust counter-messaging from moderate Muslims around the world. \u201cThis bill authorizes for a period of ten weeks just one component of the President\u2019s overall strategy, which is to train and equip moderate, vetted members of the Syrian opposition to fight against ISIL. The provision makes it very clear that it does not \u201cconstitute a specific statutory authorization for the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities\u2026\u201d If the President intends to continue U.S. military strikes against ISIL, which he has said he plans to do, he should submit a specific request to Congress to do so. The Congress should then have a full debate with amendments and votes on an Authorization of the Use of Military Force, as it should have done today. \u201cI continue to have many unanswered questions about the President\u2019s strategy, such as whether we can vet Syrian fighters sufficiently to ensure that we are not training, equipping, and arming Islamist extremists, including members of ISIL, who have infiltrated the Syrian opposition. This week, I wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry to express my concerns about the scope of the Administration\u2019s proposal, the process for vetting members of the opposition, and what the Administration is doing to detect and disrupt plots from other terrorist groups intent on harming Americans. \u201cMy support for the President\u2019s overall strategy against ISIL will depend upon the answers I receive from Secretary Kerry and the President\u2019s ability to prove that the Administration can build an effective coalition of allies against these terrorists.\u201d ###"},

The bill, authored by Senator Collins and co-sponsored by Senator King, would require DOD to treat athletic footwear like every other uniform item, including boots, and ensure that such items are bought from American manufacturers, such as New Balance.\u00a0 \"The President said in his State of the Union address that one of his top priorities is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.\u00a0 We share this priority,\" Senator Collins said.\u00a0 \"One way we can make that possible without increasing the federal deficit a single dime is to make sure that the athletic footwear purchased every year by entry-level military recruits is manufactured by U.S. companies like New Balance.\"\u00a0 \"America's athletic footwear manufacturers are highly competitive and can meet the diverse needs of our nation's servicemen and women,\" Senator King said. \"By ensuring that entry-level recruits use U.S.-made athletic footwear, like the Berry Amendment intended, our legislation supports local manufacturing, invests in real jobs for people throughout Maine and across the nation, and ensures that our new servicemen and women have the finest athletic footwear available.\" Congress passed the Berry Amendment\u00a0in 1941 to ensure that American soldiers trained and operated, to the greatest extent possible, with American-made uniforms and equipment.\u00a0 Servicemen and women are provided with dress uniforms, combat uniforms, and physical training (PT) uniforms. These items are standardized \"uniform\" items determined by the DOD, and for decades, the apparel and footwear for each of these uniforms was American-made as required by law.\u00a0 However, in 2002 the Army, followed by the Air Force in 2008, altered its acquisition process such that it no longer directly procured American-made athletic footwear for issue to incoming recruits.\u00a0 Instead, military recruits are given an \"allowance\" and are required to \"purchase\" athletic footwear thus, in the opinion of DOD, exempting athletic footwear from domestic sourcing requirements because such individual purchases fall below the simplified acquisition threshold. To correct that change in process, this bill would require that any footwear furnished or provided by cash allowance to members of the Armed Forces upon initial entry in the Armed Forces shall comply with domestic source requirements.\u00a0 A version of this legislation is also being introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Mike Michaud and Chellie Pingree.\u00a0"},

One approach is to strengthen transparency laws to ensure that voters have quick and easy access to information that can help them make informed decisions. That is why I am a cosponsor of a bill introduced by Senator Jon Tester (D-MT), the Senate Campaign Disclosure Parity Act, which would require all election-related designations, statements, and reports to be filed directly with the Federal Election Commission. I also support legislation proposed by Senator Angus King (I-ME) which would require campaigns to notify the FEC within 48 hours of receiving campaign contributions of $1,000 or more, and that would require Senate candidates to file reports directly with the FEC, instead of with the Secretary of the Senate.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Unfortunately, it\u2019s clear that the Majority Leader does not intend to allow for a serious debate of alternative proposals to strengthen our campaign finance laws.\u00a0 Instead of debating this flawed proposal to amend the Constitution, we should be taking up common-sense reforms of the kind proposed by Senators Tester and King.

The bipartisan   would create a $5,000 tax incentive for employers that use apprenticeship programs to train workers in high-demand fields such as health care, manufacturing and technology. It also would allow veterans in apprenticeships to get credit for previous military training and experience. In a 2011 survey by the National Association of Manufacturers, 67 percent of industrial companies reported a moderate to severe shortage of qualified workers. More than 65 percent of companies surveyed in a 2009 Urban Institute study thought apprenticeship programs helped raise productivity, strengthen morale and improve worker safety. \u201cFew issues are as important to the American people as the availability of good jobs in our communities,\u201d\u00a0Senator Collins said.\u00a0 \u201cI have met with many business owners in Maine who have jobs available but cannot find qualified and trained workers to fill these vacant positions.\u00a0 This bill would help better align the needs of our nation's employers with potential employees to promote hiring and the creation of new jobs.\u201d \u201cThis bill will help close the skills gap and give more American workers the training they need to power economic growth,\u201d Senator\u00a0Cantwell said. \u201cBuilding the skills of America\u2019s workers is a strong investment in our nation\u2019s future.

{"title": "\"Senior Citizens Struggling With Debt\"", "date": ["Posted Tue, 09/16/2014 - 10:41"], "release": "As Ranking Member of the Senate Aging Committee, an issue I care deeply about is whether older Americans will have the financial resources they need to be secure in retirement. After four decades in the workforce, seniors should be confident they will have the money they need to pay their bills and enjoy their retirement, without fearing they will be overtaken by debt and fall into poverty. Far too many American seniors struggle with inadequate savings, limited income, and too much debt. The importance of Social Security to low-income retirees cannot be overstated. Here in Maine, one in three retirees has no source of income beyond Social Security. Add to this, the troubling trend of increasing debt held by older Americans: a recent study by the Urban Institute found that the share of Americans 65 or older who are in debt grew from 30 percent in 1998 to 43 percent in 2010. That study also found that the median debt held by these seniors increased 56 percent, from about $13,600 to $21,200. About half of this mounting debt is attributable to mortgages, and much of the rest traces to various forms of consumer debt, such as auto loans and credit card balances. While a considerably smaller source, student loan debt is also an issue for more and more seniors. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently released a report that found that three percent of households headed by seniors still have student loan debt. Most of these loans were taken out by seniors and used to finance their own education, not that of their children or grandchildren. The default rate for these loans \u2013 31 percent \u2013 is more than twice that of the default rate for loans taken out by borrowers between the ages of 25 and 49, a troubling statistic. Seniors whose loans are in default can have their Social Security benefits garnished and reduced to as little as $750 a month. This floor was not indexed for inflation, and is now far below the poverty line. I intend to introduce legislation to adjust this floor for inflation over the past 15 years and index it going forward, to make sure garnishment does not force seniors into poverty. Whether it\u2019s paying the mortgage, medical bills, or prescription drugs, I have heard countless stories of retirees whose savings are not going as far as they anticipated. As our population continues to age, we must continue to work to help ensure that our seniors have the resources they will need to eliminate debt, save, and enjoy retirement. Earlier this year, Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) and I introduced a bill that would make it easier for small businesses to provide access to retirement plans for their workers which would help make a significant difference in the financial security of many Americans. Our bill would be a significant step toward a more secure and happy retirement."},

It was Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the unimaginable terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, that led to a law that I coauthored to strengthen our nation\u2019s capacity to respond to natural disasters as well as terrorist attacks.

National Preparedness Month allows us to evaluate our personal emergency response plans. The power of prudent planning cannot be underestimated.\u00a0 We all know that things can, and will, change in an instant if there is a natural disaster or a terrorist attack.\u00a0 And we know that we have to be prepared for such challenges whenever they occur. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, has developed a plan to help you prepare.\u00a0 First, FEMA suggests that you be informed so you and your loved ones know what to do before, during, and after an emergency.\u00a0 Second, make a plan to prepare and stay informed.\u00a0 Last, you should build a kit to help keep your family safe should you lose electricity.\u00a0 It should include at least a gallon of water per person for at least three days, a three-day supply of non-perishable food, a battery-powered radio to stay informed, a flashlight and extra batteries, and a first aid kit.\u00a0 If you have an infant, make sure all the proper supplies are in place. If you have a pet, make sure those supplies are included as well.\u00a0 For more information, check out FEMA\u2019s website at  .

Academic achievement, community service, and excelling at Dirigo Boys and Girls State here in Maine all went into making this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity possible. They also got to Washington with a lot of help.\u00a0 For 68 years, the American Legion and the American Legion Auxiliary have sponsored these programs, fulfilling their commitment to instill in our young people an understanding of our system of government and a deeper appreciation for our American values.\u00a0 Throughout their lives, these students have had parents, teachers, and community members supporting them and encouraging them to follow their dreams. As delegates, the students adopt the role of senators serving in a mock Senate, which operates under the rules and practices of the U.S. Senate.\u00a0 They form parties, elect leaders, organize into committees, and write and debate legislation. Beyond learning the legislative process, these students learn the lessons of leadership, of standing tall for one\u2019s beliefs while respecting the beliefs of others, of engaging in respectful and constructive debate, and of working together for the common good.\u00a0 Whether these students pursue careers in government, business, education, or any other field, these principles will serve them, and our society, well.

It is important to recall how the Boys and Girls State movement began.\u00a0 In the 1930s, the forces of tyranny and oppression seemed to be taking over the world \u2013 some doubted whether freedom could survive.\u00a0 The American Legion and the American Legion Auxiliary were especially concerned that these tyrannical regimes were indoctrinating their young people with their hateful ideology, and so they countered with a program to better educate young Americans in democracy.\u00a0 In 1946, the state program was expanded to the national level. It is as true today as it was back then that the continued vitality of our democracy depends on our continuing to foster among our young people knowledge of and respect for the institutions of our government and of the principles of our nation.\u00a0 I commend the American Legion and Auxiliary for making these great programs possible and all the adults in hometowns across America who encourage and support the students who participate.\u00a0 Most of all, I commend the students themselves \u2013 there is no doubt that the delegates of today will be the leaders of tomorrow. # # # Photos"},

Following is the full text of the letter: September 16, 2014 The Honorable John F. Kerry Secretary U.S. Department of State Washington, DC 20520 Dear Mr. Secretary: Last week, President Obama outlined a counterterrorism strategy with the goal of\u00a0degrading and ultimately destroying the dangerous threat posed by ISIS.\u00a0 I strongly support efforts to address this threat, but have a number of concerns about the President\u2019s plan. First, I am concerned that the proposed legislative language from the Administration to train, arm, and equip the so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d opposition in Syria is too broad because it goes beyond fighting ISIS and is also aimed at the Syrian regime.\u00a0 It seems logical to expect that the opposition forces are much more likely to direct most of their efforts against the Assad regime rather than ISIS.\u00a0 Thus, U.S. military training and arming of the opposition for purposes other than fighting ISIS risk greater American entanglement in the Syrian civil war.\u00a0 Draft language\u00a0proposed initially by the White House would allow DOD to train and equip opposition forces to combat attacks by the Assad regime and to \"promote the conditions for a negotiated settlement to end the conflict in Syria.\"\u00a0 Given the fact that Assad shows no signs of volunteering to participate in a negotiated end to the civil war in Syria, this language appears to refer to offensive operations against the Assad regime. While the disarray and lack of cohesiveness of Iraqi Security Forces have convinced me that successful operations against ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq require air strikes by a coalition of countries, the Administration does not have the legal authority for the use of U.S. military force against Syrian regime targets.\u00a0 We should focus on counterterrorism operations against ISIS that directly address the core U.S. national security interests described by the President last week.\u00a0 Senior Administration officials, including you, have said that the military operations against ISIS could take \u201cyears,\u201d not months.\u00a0 Therefore, the Administration should seek an Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) to conduct ongoing U.S. airstrikes against ISIS, and if the Administration also seeks to launch military attacks against the Syrian regime, it should submit specific language for Congress to consider as an AUMF, a significant measure that would require and deserve careful consideration, debate, amendments, and votes. Second, I seek more information on how the military will vet the \u201cmoderate\u201d Syrian opposition forces.\u00a0 Our country spent billions of dollars and more than a decade training, equipping, and arming Iraqi security forces.\u00a0 Yet, when confronted with the onslaught of ISIS fighters, these forces, with some exceptions such as the Kurdish pesh merga, simply melted away and collapsed.\u00a0 In addition, while I know our military would do its best to vet opposition fighters, the appalling green-on-blue attacks in Afghanistan demonstrate the imperfect nature of standing up any new security force, particularly when the opposition is believed to be heavily infiltrated by Islamist extremists as is the case in Syria.\u00a0 What improvements have been made in the vetting process that would lead the Administration to have confidence that the outcome would be any different in this case? Finally, I am concerned that the Administration not lose sight of the fact that most experts believe that AQAP in Yemen and the al Nusrah Front in Syria have considerable capability and the continuing desire to conduct attacks against Americans at home and abroad.\u00a0 I look forward to hearing from you in response to the concerns I have raised in this letter. ###"},
