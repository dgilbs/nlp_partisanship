Dodaro Comptroller General U.S. Government Accountability Office 441 G Street, N.W. Washington, D.C.\u00a0 20548 Dear Mr. Dodaro: We write to request that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) evaluate the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) air quality monitoring networks for ambient and hazardous air pollutants. These networks play a critical role in protecting public health, especially for children, seniors, and members of other vulnerable populations and disadvantaged communities with chronic and acute health problems such as asthma. The EPA operates multiple networks to monitor compliance with the Clean Air Act\u2019s National Ambient Air Quality Standards and to track hazardous air pollutants regulated under the act. These networks include the State and Local Air Quality Monitoring Network, the National Air Monitoring Network (which targets areas of high population density with a variety of air pollution sources), Special Purpose Monitoring Stations (used for short-term studies and other purposes), Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (used to measure pollutants that contribute to ground-level ozone, a harmful air pollutant), and the National Air Toxics Trends Stations, among others. These air quality monitoring networks are increasingly important in implementing and tracking compliance with the Clean Air Act, protecting public health, sharing monitoring data with other agencies, state and local governments, and the public, and informing policy decisions. Given the importance of these networks, we request that GAO respond to the following questions, with an emphasis on data quality, the siting and operation of monitors, trends in public health, the effects of air pollution on vulnerable populations, and shifts in the sources of air pollution, including those associated with vehicles, and industry:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you for your assistance with this request.\u00a0 Should you or members of your GAO staff have any questions about this request, please coordinate with Aaron Goldner (Senator Whitehouse) at (202) 224-2921, Laura Gillam (Senator Carper) at (202) 224-8832, and Olivia Kurtz (Senator Collins) at (202) 224-2523."},
{"title": "Commemorating Veterans Day in Freedom, Maine", "date": ["Posted Fri, 11/17/2017 - 09:43"], "release": "Veterans Day is one of the most sacred days on our national calendar.\u00a0 This year, it was a special pleasure to spend that day of remembrance and gratitude in Freedom, Maine, a town whose very name celebrates the great gift we have been given by our veterans and those who serve today. Freedom is more than the name of that lovely Waldo County community; it is its heritage.\u00a0 The first settler in 1794 was Stephen Smith, a patriot who fought for freedom in the Revolutionary War.\u00a0 The town was incorporated during the War of 1812, the first challenge to our young nation\u2019s freedom.\u00a0 In 1863, with the Civil War raging, a young man from Freedom named Daniel Davis left school and joined the 1  Maine Cavalry Regiment so that the blessing of freedom would be extended to all Americans.\u00a0 In 1880, he became Maine\u2019s 37  Governor. On Veterans Day 2017, the people of Freedom paid tribute to their family members, friends, and neighbors who served in our time.\u00a0 The celebration coincided with the 98  birthday of Roy Ward, the town\u2019s oldest citizen, whose courageous Navy service during World War II inspires us today. While Freedom\u2019s history is unique, the virtues it describes unite our great nation.\u00a0 It is estimated that some 48 million Americans have served in uniform since the founding of our nation.\u00a0 Today, more than 20 million veterans live among us, more than 116,000 right here in Maine. \u00a0To put that in perspective, Maine has more veterans per capita than all but two of the other states in the country.\u00a0 We are proud of our State\u2019s contributions to protecting our nation. Those numbers are impressive not only because of their sheer size, but also because they describe the history of a people united by the highest ideals of humanity.\u00a0 Those numbers are not cold statistics.\u00a0 Each one tells a story of courage, sacrifice, and devotion to duty. On Veterans Day, we honor those who paid the ultimate price, whether they lie at rest in foreign lands or in their hometowns.\u00a0 We honor those who lived beyond their years of military service but who have since passed on.\u00a0 We honor those who remain missing and pledge that they never will be forgotten.\u00a0 And we honor those veterans who are with us today.\u00a0 We owe them all a great debt.\u00a0 We also honor the parents, the wives and husbands, the children and other loved ones of our veterans and our troops.\u00a0 The families left behind face the challenges of daily living as they endure separation and worry.\u00a0 Their sacrifices are great, and we owe them much as well. It is the American character to answer the call of duty.\u00a0 It also is the American character to be grateful to those who answer that call.\u00a0 One has only to look at the Maine Troop Greeters, who have greeted some 1.5 million troops at the Bangor Airport, to know how much the people of our State value our service members.\u00a0 They treat our veterans with similar generosity and a spirit of caring. We owe our veterans so much, and repay that debt in part, but only in part, with the gratitude we express on Veterans Day.\u00a0 As a nation, we must also repay our debt with the health care, rehabilitation services, and educational and employment opportunities our veterans have earned through their service to our country.\u00a0 I am committed to ensuring that the government keeps that sacred obligation.\u00a0 Initiatives I have undertaken in the Senate this year to help ensure that veterans receive the quality, accessible health care and other benefits they earned through their service include the bipartisan   that would expand a successful program that helps those who care for wounded, ill, or injured veterans at home.\u00a0 Being in the Town of Freedom on Veterans Day brought to mind one of my earliest childhood memories -- going with my father, a World War II veteran, to the patriotic parades in my hometown of Caribou.\u00a0 He hoisted me high on his shoulders, and from the best vantage point along the route, I saw hats go off and hands go over hearts as Caribou paid its respects to our flag and honored our veterans for their service to our country. Our veterans provide all of us with an inspiring view from strong shoulders.\u00a0 From that vantage point, we see that the burden of service must be borne willingly and with modesty.\u00a0 We see that challenges must be met and that threats must be confronted.\u00a0 And we see that we have an obligation to always respect, honor, and support those who make that view possible."},

{"title": "ICYMI: Senator Collins Discusses Tax Reform on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d", "date": ["Posted Sat, 11/18/2017 - 23:00"], "release": "U.S. Senator Susan Collins appeared on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d today with host Jake Tapper to discuss tax reform, Senator Al Franken, and Roy Moore. A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cState of the Union\u201d November 19, 2017 TAPPER: And joining us now is Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine. Senator, I want to get to taxes in a moment, but I do want to start with the Alabama Senate race where Republican nominee Roy Moore has been accused of sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl, sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl. You've urged Moore to withdrawal from the race, but you also said that if he wins, the Senate would have, quote, no choice but to seat him. I do wonder, though, if Moore is elected, I understand he would have to be seated, but would you want the Senate to vote to expel him? COLLINS: It's too early for me to say what the Ethics Committee recommendation would be. And obviously I came out against Roy Moore very early, in fact before these terrible allegations were levied against him, because I was concerned about his performance as a member of the Alabama Supreme Court, where he had been removed twice for failing to follow lawful orders and also because of his comments on Muslims and LGBT individuals. So, these allegations are extremely disturbing. But under the Constitution, the test on whether or not you seat someone is whether they satisfy the age and residency requirements. So, we would have to seat him, but I hope we don't get there. I think we're getting ahead of ourselves. And I hope that the voters of Alabama choose not to elect him. TAPPER: Would you rather serve with Doug Jones, the Democrat, than with Roy Moore? COLLINS: I don't know Doug Jones at all, but I've never supported Roy Moore. And I hope that he does not end up being in the United States Senate. TAPPER: And just to be clear, and then we'll move on from Roy Moore, you believe the women? You think that these are credible allegations that he assaulted -- sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl and sexually molested a 14-year-old girl? COLLINS: I do. I read his explanation. I listened to his radio interview. And I did not find his denials to be convincing at all. So, from my perspective, these are credible allegations against him. TAPPER: Now, the White House has not commented on whether the allegations are credible, but President Trump did attack Senator Al Franken after the allegations against him. They were asked, the White House, this week, why are the allegations between -- against Franken different from the allegations -- multiple allegations from at least 13 different women against President Trump. Listen to how the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, answered. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH SANDERS: Specifically, Senator Franken has admitted wrongdoing and the president hasn't. I think that's a very clear distinction. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: It's kind of an odd thing to say in some ways. Do you buy the notion that Trump's accusers are not credible because the president denies the allegations? COLLINS: I did not support President Trump. He was not my candidate for president. And part of the reason why were allegations about how he treated women. I made my decision before the Hollywood Access tape came out. But I was not a supporter of President Trump for the Republican nomination. TAPPER: Let's turn to taxes. You said this week that Republicans made a big mistake when they changed the tax bill to include this repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate because that -- removing that could raise taxes or payment -- health care payments, premiums, for millions of Americans. If that provision stays in the tax bill, will that mean a \"no\" vote from you? COLLINS: Well, first of all, I think we need to distinguish between taking away insurance from people who already have it, which is what the health care bills that we considered earlier this year would have done, versus removing a fine on people who choose not to have insurance. And that fine falls disproportionately\u201480 percent\u2014on those who make under $50,000. I don't think that provision should be in the bill. I hope the Senate will follow the lead of the House and strike it. If not, I think we need to fix it by passing two bills, the Alexander-Murray bill, which will help to stabilize markets and reduce premiums, and a bill I've introduced with Bill Nelson of Florida that would create high-risk pools that would protect people with pre-existing conditions and also help to reduce premiums by 20 percent. TAPPER: You say that you have data show that the premium increase will outweigh any tax cut that a middle-income person might get from this tax bill. If that data point doesn't change -- I just want to drill in on this point -- will you have to vote \"no\" if there isn't the relief that you're looking for, either by tinkering with this bill or through the legislation you just offered? COLLINS: The bill's going to be subject to amendment on the Senate floor, and I'm filing amendments myself, in part to provide more relief to middle-income families and to deal with the very problem that you have identified. The fact is that if you do pull this piece of the Affordable Care Act out, for some middle-income families, the increased premium is going to cancel out the tax cut that they would get. And that's why it's so important that we pass the two pieces of legislation that I talked about. And it's also why we need to restore the tax deduction for state and local taxes, the way that the House did. That will help our middle-income taxpayers get more tax relief. I also want to keep the tax rate at right where it is, at 39.6 percent for people who are making $1 million or more a year, rather than lowering it, as the Senate bill would do. TAPPER: Senator Orrin Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, got angry at Democrats this week for suggesting that this tax bill is a give-a-way to the rich. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ORRIN HATCH: I really resent anybody saying that I'm just doing this for the rich. Give me a break. SEN. SHERROD BROWN: How many times do we do this before we (INAUDIBLE) -- SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Listen, I've honored you by allowing you to spout off here. And what you said was not right. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: Let's drill down on the -- on the actual issue that they're debating here. Based on the numbers you've seen, does this tax bill benefit the rich more than it does the middle class? COLLINS: It benefits people of all tax brackets. But what I want to do is to skew more of that relief to middle and low-income families.\u00a0 The Senate bill starts to do that. It doubles the child care -- the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and it also makes part of it refundable to very low-income individuals who don't pay any tax at all. It doubles the standard deduction so that a couple making $24,000 would pay no income tax at all. So, I don't think those allegations are fair. But nevertheless, there are provisions of the bill that I would like to see changed. And keeping that top rate for individuals where it is, for people making more than $1 million is one change. And I would also like to see the business taxes, which do need to be reduced, in order to incentivize the creation of good jobs and higher wages in this country, but it does not need to be reduced all the way to 20 percent for large businesses. TAPPER: All right, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, always a pleasure to have you on. Thank you so much. COLLINS: Thank you, Jake."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cThis Week\u201d November 19, 2017 GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, HOST: Want to continue it now with Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine. Senator Collins, thank you for joining us this morning. You just heard our panel right there. Weigh in, please. Do you think this is a moment where we're going to see real change? SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: I do. But I thought that there was one aspect that hasn't been discussed. And that is that the women who bring forth these allegations are often trashed. They're attacked. Their credibility is undermined. We saw that with some of President Clinton's accusers. We know the elaborate attempts that Harvey Weinstein went to in order to discredit his accusers. And that has to stop, as well. STEPHANOPOULOS: And we see -- we saw just recently both -- we're seeing it right now. You mentioned President Clinton. And it certainly did happen then. We also see Roy Moore now calling all of his accusers liars. President Trump, more than a dozen women came forward during the campaign\u00a0 He says that every single one of them are lying. COLLINS: He did say that. And, President Trump was not my choice for the Republican nominee for president. And, I did not support him in part because of the way that all of these reports about how he was treating women. He is president now. And, I am working with him on some issues. But those allegations remain very disturbing. STEPHANOPOULOS: Can you work with Roy Moore? If he gets elected, should he be investigated? Will you vote to expel? COLLINS: Well, first of all, my hope is that we won't get to that point, and that the voters of Alabama will not elect Roy Moore. I've read his denials. I've listened to his radio interview. And I did not find him to be credible. As more and more allegations come forward, that adds to the weight of evidence against him. I believe, based on my reading of the Constitution, that if he is elected that we have no choice but to seat him. Then, however, the Ethics Committee could have an investigation. And since I essentially would be a juror, if that happens, I'm not going to comment on what could happen as a result of that investigation. But, I hope that the good voters of Alabama decide not to send him to the United States Senate. STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Al Franken is also going to be subject to an Ethics investigation. You can't comment on that either? COLLINS: Well, first, let me say that I believe the allegations and Al Franken has essentially admitted to them. I'm talking about what the outcome would be if the Ethics Committee proceeds with an investigation, which I believe the Ethics Committee is going to do so. But I did find the allegations against him to be both credible, disgusting, and appalling, and degrading to women. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's move on to the tax bill. Passed the Senate Finance Committee this week. And a separate tax bill passed the House as well. You're already facing ads back in your home state by a group called \"Not One Penny.\" Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED: It's hard enough for Mainers to find our way in this economy. But the Trump Republican tax plan would leave us lost in the wilderness just to pay for huge tax cuts for the wealthiest. Thankfully, Senator Susan Collins told us that she would say no to tax breaks for the wealthiest. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: Can you vote for the bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee? COLLINS: I want to see changes in that bill. And I think there will be changes. There are some provisions of the House bill that I like better. For example, the House retains the top rate of 39.6 percent for people who make $1 million or more a year. That's a change that I would like to see be made in the Senate bill so that we can skew more of the relief to middle-income taxpayers. So, some very good provisions in the Senate bill such as the doubling of the child tax credit and making it refundable for people of low income. There\u2019s also a doubling of the standard deduction, which means that a family making $24,000 would not pay any income tax. So, there are provisions of both bills that I like. But I think the bill needs work. STEPHANOPOULOS: You can't vote for it as written? COLLINS: I haven't reached that conclusion yet, because I think there are going to be further changes. But the biggest mistake was putting in a provision from the Affordable Care Act into the Senate bill that is not in the House bill. And I hope that will be dropped or, that bills have been introduced by Senators Alexander and Murray and Bill Nelson and myself will be adopted to mitigate the impact of those provisions. STEPHANOPOULOS: That provision was put in at the insistence of the president. He was tweeting about it last week. He seems to think that it's the best way to both save some money and to get some of the partial repeal of Obamacare. So, if it stays in the bill, are you against the bill? COLLINS: It's a problem for me if it is not mitigated. But there is a way to mitigate the impact that it would have on insurance premiums. I do want to point out that that provision, all that provision says is that a person who chooses not to get insurance cannot be fined for that decision. That's very different from what we were faced with this past summer and fall when insurance was being taken away from people who wanted to be insured. The fact is that those fines are paid by -- overwhelmingly by people who make less than $50,000 a year, 80 percent of the people who pay the fines fall in that category. But I'm worried about the impact on premiums. And that's why we're going to need to pass legislation. And I would like to see that done before we go to the tax bill. STEPHANOPOULOS: And unlikely the Democrats are going to support doing that before the tax bill. One other feature of the Senate tax bill is that the corporate tax cuts are permanent, yet the individual tax cuts are temporary. COLLINS: Again, that's not a provision that I like. The House made both of them permanent. I think that is a far better way to go. I also think the reduction in the business tax rate is too steep, and that we could go to 22 percent, and then use that money, which is about $200 billion, to restore the tax deduction for state and local property taxes. That would really help middle-income taxpayers. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sounds like you still have a lot of questions about this bill. One other feature pointed out by the Congressional Budget Office this week is that if this bill passes, with the increase in the deficit that it accommodates, over $1.5 trillion, there will be at least $25 billion in Medicare cuts next year. COLLINS: I have talked to my colleagues about that, because that's obviously something that I cannot support. I do believe that's going to be dealt with as part of the budget negotiations that are ongoing right now. There are ways to reform our entitlement programs, but that is not one of them. The whole idea of across-the-board cuts or sequestration, or offsets that affect some of our most vulnerable citizens or our seniors is not something that I can support. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, Senator Collins, listening to you today, it looks like that bill is going to have to change an awful lot before it can get your support. Thank you for joining us this morning. COLLINS: Thank you, George."},

{"title": "From the Senate Floor,   Senator Collins Urges Colleagues to Support Amendments She Introduced to Support Tax Relief for the Middle Class", "date": ["Posted Thu, 11/30/2017 - 16:02"], "release": "U.S. Senator Susan Collins spoke from the Senate floor this afternoon to urge her colleagues to support four amendments she introduced to the Senate tax reform bill that would strengthen the legislation in important ways for middle-income Americans.\u00a0 \u201cBy reforming our nation\u2019s tax code, we can reduce the tax burden on hardworking Americans and help spur job creation and economic growth,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cMy amendments would improve upon the Senate\u2019s current tax reform proposal by allowing filers to deduct state and local property taxes, protecting retirement benefits for employees of nonprofit organizations and local governments, making the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit refundable, and reducing the threshold for deducting medical expenses.\u00a0 These amendments would provide essential tax relief for many middle-class families in Maine and across the country.\u201d Senator Collins\u2019 first amendment would allow taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes.\u00a0 In recent years more than 95 percent of all itemizers, and 28 percent of all federal income tax filers, deducted state and local taxes, including property taxes.\u00a0 Yet, the Senate bill would eliminate this deduction altogether.\u00a0 This deduction is especially important to Maine, where 166,000 itemizers deducted a total of $725 million in property taxes on their federal income tax returns each year.\u00a0 Senator Collins\u2019 amendment would allow the vast majority of Mainers who itemize to fully deduct their property taxes. The second amendment Senator Collins introduced would strike a provision that could reduce the retirement benefits of church, charity, school, and government employees, including firefighters, teachers, and police officers.\u00a0 As drafted, the Senate bill would eliminate critical tax rules that allow employees of nonprofits and local governments to make additional \u201ccatch-up\u201d and \u201cmake up\u201d contributions to their retirement accounts during and near the end of their careers.\u00a0 This amendment would protect these special rules to ensure those employees who serve the public achieve greater retirement security. Senator Collins\u2019 third amendment would improve the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit by making it refundable, thus providing much-needed assistance to low-income working families.\u00a0 This would help many families afford high-quality child care or adult day care for older parents or other relatives who can no longer care for themselves. Finally, Senator Collins introduced an amendment that would lower the threshold for Americans to deduct medical expenses.\u00a0 Currently, due to a provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), consumers can deduct medical expenses only if they exceed 10 percent of their income.\u00a0\u00a0 Senator Collins\u2019 amendment would restore the threshold to 7.5 percent, the level prior to the ACA, to help all taxpayers, and particularly seniors, who are struggling with high medical costs."},
{"title": "Senator Collins\u2019 Statement in Support of Senate Tax Reform Bill", "date": ["Posted Fri, 12/01/2017 - 14:56"], "release": "U.S. Senator Susan Collins announced today that, after securing significant changes, she will support  , the first major overhaul of our nation\u2019s tax code since 1986. She released the following statement: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a single American who thinks that our current tax code is fair, simple, or promotes economic growth.\u00a0 We need a tax system that will boost the economy, help the middle class, and encourage small businesses to grow and create jobs.\u00a0 If we stimulate the economy through tax reform, we can significantly increase federal revenues while boosting Americans\u2019 take-home pay.\u00a0 \u201cBy nearly doubling the standard deduction and expanding the child tax credit, this bill will provide significant relief to lower- and middle-income taxpayers. For example, a single mother with one child earning $35,000 will see her taxes drop by nearly 4,000 percent. Instead of paying money to Washington, she will be getting more than $1,100 back each year to help her make ends meet.\u00a0 \u201cOver the past several weeks, I have worked to ensure that the Senate bill includes a number of important changes. \u201cFirst, I advocated strongly for restoring the state and local property tax deduction up to $10,000, a critical provision that will provide much-needed tax relief for hard-working, middle-income families.\u00a0 Passage of my amendment will allow the vast majority of Mainers who itemize to fully deduct their property tax bill. In Maine, 166,000 taxpayers who itemize deduct a total of $725 million in property taxes on their federal income tax returns.\u00a0 This is often the largest deduction taken by Mainers. In fact, Mainers have the 11  highest per capita property tax burden in the nation.\u00a0 \u201cSecond, my amendment to help Americans struggling with high unreimbursed health care costs was incorporated into the bill.\u00a0 I am pleased that the final bill will include my amendment to lower the threshold for claiming the deduction for these unreimbursed expenses from 10 percent to 7.5 percent of income for two years.\u00a0 The House bill eliminated this long-standing deduction used by 8.8 million Americans \u2013 nearly half of whom make less than $50,000 per year.\u00a0 A harmful provision of the Affordable Care Act had increased the threshold to 10 percent of income. Lowering the threshold will provide relief for those experiencing particularly high health care costs, including seniors and those with pre-existing conditions.  \u201cThird, I\u2019m pleased that my amendment to reverse the Senate bill\u2019s ill-advised elimination of catch-up contributions to retirement accounts for church, charity, school, and public employees was adopted. My amendment will help protect these employees \u2013 including firefighters, school teachers, and police officers \u2013 by striking provisions in the Senate bill that would have reduced their ability to save for retirement.\u00a0 These first responders and other public servants should not have their standard of living in retirement diminished because they chose to work in public service. \u201cIn addition, I was deeply concerned that the repeal of the individual mandate would almost certainly lead to further increases in the cost of health insurance premiums \u2013 premiums that are already too expensive under the ACA.\u00a0  \u00a0 The first, the Bipartisan Health Care Stabilization Act introduced by Senators Alexander and Murray, will provide vital funding in 2019 and 2020 for the cost-sharing reductions received by low-income enrollees in the ACA exchanges.\u00a0 This funding helps low-income families pay their out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles and co-pays. The second is bipartisan legislation I introduced that would protect people with pre-existing conditions while lowering premiums through the use of high-risk pools.\u00a0 This plan will provide $5 billion annually for two years in seed money for states to establish invisible high-risk pools or traditional reinsurance programs. We know from experiences in the states of Maine and Alaska that high-risk pools can help to lower premiums substantially \u2013 by an average of 20 percent.\u00a0 \u201cI have also heard a great deal of concern from seniors with the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s determination that an automatic four percent cut to Medicare, estimated to be roughly $25 billion for fiscal year 2018, could be triggered by the passage of this legislation as a result of the Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) even though there is no intention for such a reduction to occur.\u00a0 Medicare provides essential benefits to our nation\u2019s seniors, and any reduction in funding triggered in this way would be completely unacceptable.\u00a0   urging that we immediately remove the threat of an automatic cut in the program\u2019s funding, which has been done on numerous occasions before, and  . \u201cHaving secured these key improvements in the bill, as well as the commitments to legislation to help lower health insurance premiums, I will cast my vote in support of the Senate tax reform bill. As revised, this bill will provide much-needed tax relief and simplification for lower- and middle-income families, while spurring the creation of good jobs and greater economic growth.\u201d"},
{"title": "A Bold Approach to Fighting Alzheimer\u2019s", "date": ["Posted Mon, 11/13/2017 - 12:40"], "release": "November is National Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Awareness Month, first declared by President Ronald Reagan in 1983.\u00a0 Just 11 years later, President Reagan himself was diagnosed with the terrible disease that eventually claimed his life, as it has claimed the lives of so many others. This month is dedicated to those who have been stricken with Alzheimer\u2019s, their family members and other devoted caregivers, and to the medical professionals and researchers who are working to advance our understanding of the disease, find an effective treatment, and, ultimately, discover a cure and a means of prevention. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is one of the greatest under-recognized public health threats of our time.\u00a0 Five and a half million Americans are living with the disease, including 27,000 here in Maine, and that number is soaring as our overall population grows older and lives longer.\u00a0 In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer\u2019s is our nation\u2019s costliest disease.\u00a0 The United States spends more than $259 billion per year, including $175 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid.\u00a0 By 2050, if we continue along this trajectory, costs are projected to increase to more than $1.1 trillion, and the number of Americans living with Alzheimer\u2019s is expected to reach 16 million.\u00a0 While Alzheimer\u2019s is the only one of our nation\u2019s most deadly diseases without an effective treatment or cure, new research is showing that there are actions we can take to promote prevention and improve treatment.\u00a0 The first step we should take is to recognize Alzheimer\u2019s as a public health crisis.\u00a0 I have introduced bipartisan legislation, the Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer\u2019s Act, to create a public health infrastructure to combat Alzheimer\u2019s disease and preserve brain health through early detection and diagnosis as well as improved treatment and care. It is because of public health advancements that we have safe water to drink, vaccines to prevent deadly diseases, and emergency preparedness tools to save lives.\u00a0 Using a public health approach, there is potential to change the trajectory of Alzheimer\u2019s. The effort to overcome Alzheimer\u2019s disease through a unified national effort is gaining traction.\u00a0 In 1999, when I founded the Bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer\u2019s, there was virtually no focus in Washington on this disease.\u00a0 In fact, people were afraid to say the word \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s,\u201d just as \u2013 years ago \u2013 people didn\u2019t talk about cancer.\u00a0 Seven years ago, I co-authored the bipartisan National Alzheimer\u2019s Project Act, which set the primary goal of preventing and effectively treating the disease by 2025.\u00a0 That legislation created an expert council, which has calculated that $2 billion per year is needed to achieve that goal. On the Appropriations Committee, I worked to turn the words of that recommendation into action.\u00a0 The proposed funding bill for the upcoming fiscal year provides a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health that includes a $414 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s research, the largest in history.\u00a0 That brings the total for Alzheimer\u2019s research to $1.8 billion \u2013 well within reach of our $2 billion goal.\u00a0 While research is moving forward, we must also put in practice what we know about prevention, and enhance the quality of care and support for those living with Alzheimer\u2019s and their families.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on families and communities.\u00a0 The BOLD Act, which I have introduced, would establish Centers of Excellence in Public Health Practice to promote better treatment and care for those living with Alzheimer\u2019s.\u00a0 The Centers would also educate the public on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cognitive decline, and brain health.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My legislation would also help communities across America to combat Alzheimer\u2019s. \u00a0The legislation would direct the CDC to establish and distribute awards of funding to local public health departments to support Americans living with Alzheimer\u2019s and their caregivers.\u00a0 The awards of funding would also be used to educate Americans about ways to reduce the risk of memory loss, and other symptoms that can happen before Alzheimer\u2019s strikes.\u00a0 Finally, at the heart of public health is data.\u00a0 This legislation would direct CDC to collect data to help us better understand the trends in cognitive decline, cognitive impairment, and caregiving.\u00a0 The data would be shared with the public and used to improve brain health. For far too long we have viewed Alzheimer\u2019s as an aging issue that plagues some seniors today and threatens to affect many more tomorrow.\u00a0 New research finds that, in fact, Alzheimer\u2019s is a public health issue with a course that we can change.\u00a0 The BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer\u2019s Act would create a new enlightened public policy out of promising research.\u00a0 It would dramatically change the way we think of the disease, and ultimately, it has the potential to save millions of lives.\u00a0"},

Thank you for being on this morning. SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R) MAINE: Thank you. BRZEZINSKI: So what was behind the decision to stay in? COLLINS: It was a very difficult decision. The attraction of being in Maine full-time, close to much of my family and many of my friends was very strong. And governor, it's a far more hands-on job where you can really make a difference on issues like providing more economic opportunities. But in the end, I decided that the issues right now in Washington are so consequential. They're so huge. And I am a person who likes to work across the aisle and builds bipartisan coalitions, and that's what I decided I wanted to do.

I remember talking to Sen. McCain in January or February and saying, \u201cIt's extraordinary. Of all the sacrifices you've made for this country, this may be your greatest contribution right now because there's so much chaos in Washington.\u201d Do you feel like what you are doing right now is as substantial and as important as anything you've done in your decades of public service? COLLINS: I really do. These are chaotic times in Washington and Washington reflects the division and the discord that we see throughout our country. The polarization has never been greater. And yet, I remain a congenital optimist that as the pendulum will swing back and if those of us who are in the middle leave, I worry who will lead that effort to bring us back and get things done for the American people in a way that is less partisan and that invites input by both Republicans and Democrats. I would say, however, I would never begin to compare myself to John McCain, who has done so much for our country. STEVE RATTNER, MSNBC ECONOMIC ANALYST, FORMER TREASURY OFFICIAL: Senator, it's Steve Rattner. As you well know, there are more than a dozen things the president has done in the last few months that are likely to diminish enrollments in the ACA or otherwise impede people getting health care. You've spoken out against some of them. I assume you're probably unhappy with most all of them. But what, if anything, can you do to actually change the course of what's happening and try to preserve health care that is in jeopardy for millions of Americans at the moment? COLLINS: What we should do is immediately pass legislation that's been negotiated by Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, who heads the Senate Health Committee, which I'm a member of, which would help to lower premiums, stabilize the markets, and give clear authorization for the cost-saving reductions that are essential to help low-income people pay their out-of-pocket costs. And that's a package that I believe can garner support on both sides of the aisle, and I hope that the president would sign it into law. BRZEZINSKI: Yamiche -- YAMICHE ALCINDOR, REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Senator Collins, I want to ask you about being a woman on the hill. Yesterday, I was talking to some colleagues about the culture on the hill and with Harvey Weinstein, and we're talking all about the culture of Hollywood and women essentially being sexually assaulted or sexually harassed. Have you heard about that culture in D.C.? Have you, yourself, experienced anything like that? And what do you say to people who say Capitol Hill might need to look at its own culture? COLLINS: It's always good for an organization to review its own culture to make sure that equality and justice prevail throughout. I have not experienced that but undoubtedly, we know from some press accounts that it has happened before. And it is reprehensible, regardless of the working environment in which it occurs. Regardless of whether it's Hollywood or Washington or Main Street America. And I believe that these brave women coming forth and confronting one of the most powerful individuals in Hollywood will help others speak out about their experience and send a very clear message that this is not tolerated. I will say that I do think that when women are elected to the United States Senate that we do face an extra barrier that men do not. When a man is elected to the Senate it's assumed that he belongs there. My experience has been that we women have to prove that we belong there and once we do that we're accepted. But there is an extra barrier that I've found. BRZEZINSKI: Interesting. Steve Schmidt -- STEVE SCHMIDT, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Senator, good morning. Your colleague, Bob Corker, a man -- serious, sober, not given to hyperbole -- has talked quite critically, quite openly about this administration worrying about the president's capacity to start World War III. We have the secretary of state talking about the negotiations will continue until the first bombs drop. How concerned are you and how legitimate do you find Sen. Corker's criticism behaviorally of this administration? How worried are you? COLLINS: Let me say first that I'm a friend of Bob Corker's. I think he's an excellent senator and a great leader of the Foreign Committee, and he knows a great deal. I don't think the Twitter war between him and the president is productive and I'd like to see them get back to working on the Iran legislation, for example. But there's no doubt that this president's been extremely unconventional in his approach and that has caused more chaos than I think is good for our country and for our relationship with both our allies and our enemies. I would urge the president to remember that every single word that he says matters. When he was in the private sector and the business world, he could make an off-the-hand comment, and it really didn't matter. Even as a candidate, it could be excused because he was running for political office. But he is now President of the United States of America, and every word that he says counts. And that's why I'd encourage him to be more careful with his rhetoric because of the signal\u2014the inadvertent signal\u2014that it may send not only to Americans but to our adversaries and our allies around the world. BRZEZINSKI: For sure. Senator Susan Collins, thank you so much."},

The resolution was a cap to the celebratory week that ran September 10th through the 16th. Direct Support Professionals (DSPs) are an invaluable part of our nation's health care system, caring for the most vulnerable Americans, including the chronically ill, seniors, and those living with a disability. With the help of Direct Support Professionals, these individuals can perform daily activities that many people take for granted, such as eating, bathing, dressing, and leaving the house. The work of Direct Support Professionals ensures that these individuals can be active participants in their communities. \u201cDirect Support Professionals play an essential role in our communities by providing those in need with critical support that leads to more independent living and a better quality of life,\u201d   \u201cThe \u2018National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week\u2019 Resolution ensures that these professionals are getting the recognition they deserve. I was pleased to join Senator Cardin in co-authoring this resolution, and I thank all National Direct Support Professionals for their hard work and dedication.\u201d \u201cAs our population continues to grow and age, the demand for DSPs and other home-and community-based services will increase to address evolving health care needs. We are incredibly fortunate to have millions of service-oriented Americans who are willing to rise to the task of becoming a Direct Support Professional,\u201d  \u201cI thank Maryland\u2019s Direct Support Professionals and the many more across America for all they do to ensure our families, friends and neighbors can live with dignity and comfort. The quality of home and community-based services and overall patient experience truly lies in their hands.\u201d According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the employment of DSPs is projected to grow by an average of 26 percent from 2014 to 2024, compared to a seven percent average growth rate for all occupations during that period. Unfortunately, direct support professionals are often forced to leave the jobs they love due to low wages and excessive, difficult, work hours. Many Direct Support Professionals rely on public benefits, and some must work multiple jobs in order to provide for themselves and their families. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we work to ensure that these hard-working individuals have the income and emotional support they need and deserve. In addition to Senators Collins and Cardin, the resolution marking Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week was cosponsored by Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Angus King (I-Maine), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)."},

In 1981, on his last day as Washington Bureau Chief for the Post-Dispatch, he ran up Connecticut Avenue to cover the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. For some of the most momentous events of the second half of the 20th Century, Richard Dudman wrote the first draft of history. After retiring and moving to Ellsworth and Little Cranberry Island in Maine, Mr. Dudman continued to contribute to the Post-Dispatch and wrote more than 1,000 editorials for the Bangor Daily News. Among his many accolades are the prestigious George Polk Career Award in Journalism and induction into the Maine Press Association Hall of Fame. Mr. Dudman combined his journalistic professionalism with a spirit of serving others. In 2014, he and his wife, Helen, were presented with the Golden Eagle Award from the Boy Scouts of America for their commitment to community service, a quality that ran through their remarkable 69 years of marriage. In this time of sorrow, I offer my deep condolences to Helen and their family. I hope they will find comfort in Richard\u2019s inspiring legacy and in a life well-lived. M-. President, it has been said that we all have a Birthdate and a Deathdate, with a dash in between. It\u2019s what we do with our dash that counts. Richard Dudman\u2019s dash was extraordinarily long, and he made it count. He filled it with passion, professionalism, and dedication. May his memory inspire us all to do the same."},

Collins, Klobuchar\u2019s Bipartisan Legislation to Crack Down on Fraud Targeted at Seniors Passes Senate", "date": ["Posted Thu, 08/03/2017 - 16:21"], "release": "\u00a0U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) announced that their bipartisan legislation to crack down on fraud targeted at seniors has passed the Senate. Schemes targeting seniors include impersonation scams; fraudulent investment plans, prizes, and sweepstakes; Internet fraud; charity scams; predatory home lenders; telemarketing and mail fraud; and Ponzi schemes. The Seniors Fraud Prevention Act would help fight scams designed to deprive seniors of their assets by educating seniors about fraud schemes and improving monitoring and response to fraud complaints. \u201cOne of my top priorities as Chairman of the Senate Aging Committee is to combat scams that target seniors. My Committee has held multiple hearings exposing and examining a number of these scams and maintains a Fraud Hotline staffed by experienced investigators to assist seniors, yet much more remains to be done,\u201d   \u201cI am pleased that the Senate unanimously supported our legislation, which will enhance fraud monitoring, increase consumer education, and strengthen the complaint tracking system to help prevent seniors from being robbed of their hard-earned savings through threatening and manipulative scams.\u201d Senators Collins and Klobuchar\u2019s bill would help protect seniors from fraud schemes by strengthening the complaint system to ensure complaints of fraud are handled quickly by the appropriate law enforcement agencies. The bill would also require the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the agency responsible for handling consumer complaints, to coordinate with other agencies to monitor the market for fraud schemes targeting seniors. In addition, the bill would require the FTC to distribute information materials to seniors, their families, and their caregivers that explain how to recognize fraud schemes and how to contact law enforcement authorities in the event that a senior is targeted. Senator Collins has long sought to increase public awareness and combat fraud targeting older Americans.

{"title": "ICYMI: \u201cSenate Passes F.D.A. Funding and \u2018Right-to-Try\u2019 Drug Bills\u201d", "date": ["Posted Fri, 08/04/2017 - 10:29"], "release": "By: Robert Pear and Sheila Kaplan Click   to read the full article online. An excerpt as well as the full story are also pasted below. \u201cThe food and drug agency depends on user fees to speed the approval of drugs while maintaining strict standards of drug safety. \u201c\u2018User fees, where companies fund a portion of the premarket review of their products, account for more than a quarter of all F.D.A. funding, yet the F.D.A.\u2019s authority to collect these fees will expire at the end of next month unless Congress acts. That\u2019s the urgency of getting this bill across the finish line,\u2019 said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. \u201cAs chairwoman of the Senate Aging Committee,  The Senate on Thursday gave final approval to legislation to finance the Food and Drug Administration, clearing the measure for President Trump and tapping drug manufacturers once again to help pay for the federal review of prescription drugs and medical devices. The 94-to-1 vote came just hours after the Senate passed a separate bill expanding access to experimental treatments for people with terminal illnesses. This bill, the Right to Try Act, will now go to the House, where more than three dozen lawmakers have endorsed similar legislation. Mr. Trump is expected to sign the bill reauthorizing user fees to pay for the agency to review medical devices, brand-name drugs, generic drugs and biosimilars, which are copycat versions of costly biologic drugs made from living organisms. The House approved the user fee bill by voice vote on July 12. The vote capped an often frustrating seven months for Republicans, who hoped to churn out reams of conservative legislation with their control of both chambers and the White House. Since the dramatic failure of the Senate\u2019s health care repeal bill last week, lawmakers have seemed resigned to more incremental successes. \u201cWe\u2019re passing critical legislation. We\u2019re confirming nominees to important positions,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said from the Senate floor on Thursday, citing a series of veterans\u2019 bills and the confirmation this week of a new F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray. \u201cWe\u2019re taking steps in the right direction.\u201d Yet, even on their final day in session, lawmakers were reminded of the often uncomfortable marriage between Mr. Trump and the Republican-led Congress. Mr. Trump lashed out over a bill \u2014 which he signed grudgingly this week \u2014 to sanction Russia for meddling in last year\u2019s presidential election and for its aggression toward its neighbors. The legislation also limits Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to lift or suspend the sanctions himself. The measure, which the administration sought to block as it moved through the Capitol in recent weeks, is among the most significant accomplishments of this Congress. Some senators are also maneuvering in response to the White House\u2019s criticisms of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into ties between people in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit and Russia. On Thursday, Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, and Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, introduced legislation that would allow for judicial review if a special counsel was removed. The F.D.A. bill, which passed overwhelmingly in both houses, was a struggle, taking lawmakers more than a year to forge a consensus among Republicans, Democrats, F.D.A. officials and drug and device companies. \u201cThis is a bill that\u2019s been done the right way,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate health committee, in a subtle dig at Republican leaders who bypassed the committee and Democrats on their failed push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of the way the Senate is supposed to work.\u201d Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the committee, said, \u201cThis is really a great example of how Congress can actually work together on health issues and solve challenges.\u201d The food and drug agency depends on user fees to speed the approval of drugs while maintaining strict standards of drug safety. \u201cUser fees, where companies fund a portion of the premarket review of their products, account for more than a quarter of all F.D.A. funding, yet the F.D.A.\u2019s authority to collect these fees will expire at the end of next month unless Congress acts. That\u2019s the urgency of getting this bill across the finish line,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. The bill includes a proposal by Ms. Collins intended to prevent huge, unjustified cost increases on decades-old prescription medicines that have no competition. The legislation directs the agency to speed the review of generic drug applications when products on the market have little or no competition. As chairwoman of the Senate Aging Committee, Ms. Collins conducted a yearlong investigation that found \u201cegregious price spikes for certain off-patent drugs for which there were no generic competitors.\u201d The \u201cright-to-try bill,\u201d introduced by Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, aims to establish a new pathway for terminally ill patients to gain access to experimental drugs that have not been approved by the F.D.A. These patients are often extremely ill and unable to participate in clinical trials, or have no other treatment options. Under current law, drug companies can already provide access to patients outside of clinical trials under a program known as expanded access or compassionate use. The F.D.A. already approves about 99 percent of compassionate use requests. But companies sometimes refuse, fearing that the results could be used against them by the F.D.A. In some cases, drug makers fear they could be sued by patients who say they have been injured by unapproved drug products. The bill would establish national standards and rules to help channel drugs still under development to terminally ill patients. It also would shield pharmaceutical companies and doctors from some of the legal risks of providing drugs that have not been approved by the agency. Companies that manufacture such drugs and doctors who prescribe them would generally be protected unless they engaged in \u201creckless or willful misconduct\u201d or \u201cgross negligence,\u201d or intentionally harmed a patient. \u201cThese are real people facing their mortality with no hope,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThis right-to-try piece of legislation will give those individuals and families hope.\u201d Lawmakers and right-to-try advocates often say that terminally ill patients have nothing to lose. But those who oppose the bill say there is a difference between dying comfortably and dying horribly, suffering pain and other side effects of an unapproved drug. Patients seeking access to unapproved drugs often contact members of Congress and their aides, who in most cases do not have the medical background to determine whether a treatment is safe and effective."},

I am pleased that our bipartisan plan will increase generic competition, which is so important to American families and particularly our seniors, who take a disproportionate number of the prescription drugs that are prescribed in this country.\u201d \u201cPrescription drugs aren\u2019t a luxury item\u2014for many, they\u2019re lifesavers, and Missouri families shouldn\u2019t have to choose between their prescriptions and their groceries,\u201d   \u201cWe\u2019ve got to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, and a fundamental way to do that is through generic competition.

Their investigation included a series of hearings that strived to understand why companies can make these large price increases and to identify which policies should be considered to counter these disturbing practices. In December 2016, Senators Collins and McCaskill   on drug pricing that detailed the Committee\u2019s findings. Senators Collins and McCaskill\u2019s bipartisan plan will   to foster a competitive marketplace to help keep drug prices down and improve access to affordable prescription drugs for Americans.

Their bill would address this issue by reauthorizing and strengthening the successful Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program, which trains physicians in underserved, community-based settings. \u201cThis legislation would extend an important program to address the shortage of primary care doctors, which is especially critical in rural and underserved communities that are often those hardest hit by the opioid epidemic,\u201d   \u201cI urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation to help train the next generation of physicians and ensure all Americans have access to quality health services.\u201d \u201cDoctor shortages disproportionately impact rural communities and rural families,\u201d   \u201cBy getting more doctors into our rural hospitals and clinics we can provide a boost to rural America and ensure that folks living in in small towns aren\u2019t forced to endure dangerously long distances to see a doctor.\u201d \"The reauthorization and expansion of the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) Program is a critical step in providing healthcare to our citizens in rural areas, and I commend Senators Collins and Tester for their bipartisan leadership,\u201d   \u201cIt is well known that physicians, dentists, and other healthcare providers practice where they are trained. Providing training opportunities in underserved communities through the THCGME Program is an effective way to assure that people living in rural Maine and the millions of others living in underserved communities across America have access to the healthcare they need.\" By 2025, the United States is estimated to need more than 100,000 new physicians to meet the growing demand for health care services across the country. For the past six years the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program has worked to fill this gap. The program helps to train medical residents in community-based settings, including low-income, underserved rural and urban neighborhoods. Since 2011, the Penobscot Community Health Care Center has trained 31 residents and served more than 15,000 dental patients in Bangor, Maine. Medical education residents who train at teaching health centers are significantly more likely to remain in rural or underserved communities. The Training the Next Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act would reauthorize the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program for three years. It would also allow the expansion of new programs within existing teaching health centers as well as the creation of new centers to meet the growing need for community health services. The bill has gained support from numerous physician and medical education associations, including: The American Association of Teaching Health Centers; Senators Collins and Tester\u2019s legislation was cosponsored by Senators Thad Cochran (R-MS), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Steve Daines (R-MT), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and John Boozman (R-AR)."},

A transcript of the interview follows: JACKSON: Republican senator Susan Collins of Maine may have some, as well, for the president. She\u2019s joining us exclusively now. Senator, thank you for being with us here. COLLINS: Well, welcome to Bangor, Maine. JACKSON: I want to talk about what\u2019s going on in Washington, but I have to start with the news of the day, which is what is happening in Afghanistan. You have watched this war play out for 16 years. Are you confident that the president can execute some kind of a successful strategy, if it means increasing the number of troops on the ground? COLLINS: Well, we need to hear the strategy that the president is going to present tonight. I will say two things. And that is that in the past 16 years, our efforts in Afghanistan, which have cost the lives of so many troops, have lacked focus. There hasn't been a strategy. Second, we need a strategy that is going to deal with the influence of countries like Pakistan, like Iran, like Russia. JACKSON: So, if the president decides to stay the course, as he may do, is that enough for you? COLLINS: I\u2019m worried about that, because if you look at a map of Afghanistan, the Taliban has made enormous gains in the last couple of years. I don't want Afghanistan to be a safe haven for terrorist attacks the way that it was prior to the attacks on our country on 9/11. But this is a very difficult issue. And I\u2019m glad that there's been a detailed analysis of what to do. That\u2019s what we needed. JACKSON: I know you will be watching that address tonight as well as people across Maine. It will likely be in the front page tomorrow. What was in the front page today, I want to show you of the Bangor Daily News, and that is the protests over the weekend. Charlottesville and the aftermath of what happened there have been driving a lot of the conversation, and in the wake of that, your republican colleague, Senator Corker questioned President Trump's competency. Senator Tim Scott said the president had compromised his moral authority. What do you say about the president's response? COLLINS: The president had an obligation, a moral obligation to speak with absolute clarity from the very beginning. And stick with that to denounce the neo-Nazis, the white supremacists, the anti-Semitism that we heard, and unfortunately he wavered back and forth. There are no good neo-Nazis. JACKSON: What does that say to you about his leadership? COLLINS: In this case, I think the president failed to meet the standard that we would have expected a president to do in a time like that. There should be no place for hatred, bigotry and racism in this country. And he should have said that very clearly. He did at times, but then he wavered back and forth. JACKSON: Given your concerns about that, senator, at what point, though, given what we heard from your republican colleagues, does that talk turn into action? At what point, if any, do you not support his re-nomination? COLLINS: Well, I didn't support the president when he was our party's nominee. That was a very difficult position for me to take. I\u2019d never taken it before. Instead, I wrote in the name of Paul Ryan. And that was very hard to me to do as a lifelong republican. JACKSON: So what happens, he is already running for re-election, what is happening next? COLLINS: It is too early to tell now. There is a long ways between now and that point. JACKSON: Do you think he will end up the party's nominee in 2020? COLLINS: It\u2019s too difficult to say. JACKSON: Let me ask you about health care, because hat is something that was critical to the president on the campaign. You were one of the pivotal no votes on that. Let me ask you this, since there is still talk about this coming back up in the fall, is repeal and replace dead altogether? COLLINS: Repeal without a replacement that is workable, that doesn't hurt vulnerable people, and destroy the ability to a health care in rural America, I hope it's behind us. That does not mean that our job is done. There are serious problems with the Affordable Care Act. High premiums, the insurers fleeing the markets, so that even if you have a subsidy there is no policy that you can buy. And we're starting hearings in the Senate Health Committee in September to address those issues. JACKSON: So, to help stabilize the individual markets. Is that enough? Is that going to be the accomplishment you can point to when we talk on the December break? COLLINS: It\u2019s not enough. But it's an essential first step. I see a series of bills, where we address many of the problems that are associated with the ACA. JACKSON: You have been trying to work to lower prescription drug pricing, for example, which is an example for a lot of folks here in Maine. Is that an area where you see bipartisan consensus? COLLINS: I really hope so. I am so offended by an investigation that I conducted with Claire McCaskill last year on the Aging Committee, where we found that companies were buying these drugs from which the patent had expired and literally overnight hiking the cost of medicine by as much as 5,000%. We need to have a more competitive marketplace where generics are more readily available. And we're working with the FDA commissioner to do just that. JACKSON: Two more very quick questions for you. Are you satisfied with Senator McConnell\u2019s leadership on not just health care but and his response to President Trump and the way he's conducting his business? COLLINS: I don't always agree with Senator McConnell, but I think he has been a good and effective leader. JACKSON: You continue to back him as the leader of the Senate? COLLINS: I do. JACKSON: Opioid issues are, obviously, crucial here in Maine. If funding does come through for more prevention and help with people who are struggling with addiction, where does that go? COLLINS: We need a three-prong approach, and we need to focus on prevention education and focus on treatment, and we need to focus on enforcement, we need to do all three. The most painful statistic in Maine is 1,000 babies were born last year to addicted mothers. JACKSON: It\u2019s a powerful statistic and one that is hard to hear. Before I let you go, there is obviously a lot of political discussion about your role, your future here in Maine. Are you going to run for governor? COLLINS: I have not made a decision. On the one hand, a lot of seniority in the Senate, I\u2019m 15th and I started out at 99th. And I serve on the Appropriations Committee which has allowed me to do a lot of good for the people of Maine. On the other hand, governor is more hands-on. You can do more to create good jobs. So, I\u2019m weighing where I can do the most good for the people of Maine. JACKSON: Does the person in the White House affect your decision all? Does the fact that it's President Trump, who you would be working with as a senator, who you clearly have disagreements with, play in with your decision? COLLINS: No, not really. I want to evaluate where I can do the best for the people of Maine and I\u2019m taking in a lot of advice from people. JACKSON: Senator Collins I hope if and when you make that decision, you'll come back and share it with us. I appreciate you being here with us from Bangor, Maine, a place that you know well."},

Upward Bound helps low-income, first-generation, and other students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursue higher education. Earlier this year, due to a minor line spacing issue in UMPI\u2019s original application, the Department of Education prohibited UMPI\u2019s grant application from being reviewed, jeopardizing services to nearly 1,000 students. Following a months-long push led by Senator Collins, the Department of Education reversed this absurd bureaucratic decision and agreed to review UMPI\u2019s full application. \u201cI am absolutely delighted to announce that UMPI has been awarded more than $639,000 for its Upward Bound Program,\u201d   \u201cThe Department of Education\u2019s initial refusal to review this application due to a minor line spacing issue was absurd. It is no surprise that when the Department reversed this decision\u2014after a months-long push from the Maine delegation\u2014and agreed to review the application on the merits, UMPI\u2019s application was selected. This funding will help nearly 1,000 students over the next five years who depend on Upward Bound to pursue their higher education goals.\u201d Senator Collins championed two provisions that were included in the fiscal year 2017 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which provided the Department with the ability to review the Upward Bound applications. The first was an additional $50 million for TRIO for which Senator Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, successfully advocated   last year. The second was language   that \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d the Department \u201cto provide flexibility to [affected] applicants by permitting submission of a corrected application.\u201d Senator Collins worked tirelessly with other members of the Maine delegation and a bipartisan group of Senators to urge the Department of Education to overturn its initial rejection of dozens of Upward Bound applications. In addition to securing additional money for TRIO and pressing for action in the Omnibus, Senator Collins joined Senator King and Representatives Poliquin and Pingree   to Secretary DeVos on April 14th to express their strong concern with the Department\u2019s decision. Moreover, on April 28th, Senator Collins and Senator Jon Tester (D-MT)  signed by 25 Senators, including Senator King, urging the Department of Education to read and score these grant applications.

The   modifies the IMD Exclusion to allow Medicaid coverage for up to 40 beds within larger appropriately accredited \u201cresidential addiction treatment facilities\u201d for up to 60 consecutive days for adults with substance use disorders.\u00a0 The bill allows individuals receiving addiction treatment in such a facility to maintain Medicaid coverage for other medical services, which are currently ineligible under the IMD Exclusion.\u00a0 In Illinois, the most recent data available indicates that the   would expand access to more than 535 residential addiction treatment beds across 18 facilities that are larger than the 16 bed limit and therefore presently ineligible for Medicaid payments, as well as allowing current facilities constricted to just 16 beds to expand their treatment capacity. The legislation also establishes a new $50 million youth inpatient addiction treatment grant program to fund facilities that provide substance use disorder treatment services to underserved, at-risk Medicaid beneficiaries who are younger than age 21, with an emphasis on rural communities.\u00a0 In addition, the bill would increase flexibility for pregnant and postpartum women who are seeking treatment, and would allow them to access the services they need to ensure positive birth outcomes.\u00a0 This legislation builds off a letter that Sens.

Insulin-dependent Medicare beneficiaries rely on therapies such as patch pumps, which provide continuous insulin delivery without the need for tubes, to help manage their disease.

The hearing was the first in a four-part series on short-term insurance market stabilization. Senator Collins has consistently championed a bipartisan process to begin fixing the flaws in the Affordable Care Act so that it will work better for all Americans. State insurance commissioners have extensive hands-on experience and practical insight that will be invaluable to the Committee as it works to develop commonsense policies to improve the health insurance market. Senator Collins served as the commissioner of the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, which oversaw the Maine Bureau of Insurance, from 1987-1992. Senator Collins told Julie Mix McPeak, the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, about Maine\u2019s success at lowering premiums through a resinsurance program that ended when the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges opened. She asked Ms. McPeak about the feasibility of the federal government providing technical and financial assistance to help states replicate Maine\u2019s achievement. \u201cWe heard today of the success of the reinsurance pool that Alaska set up. Similarly, Maine between 2012 and 2013 had a reinsurance pool that was successful in lowering rates in the individual market by 20 percent on average,\u201d   \u201cSo I think when you look at the experience of those two states alone it shows the benefit of reinsurance pools.\u201d \u201cI do believe that the reinsurance mechanism or a high-risk pool, either one, has the effect of removing from the risk pool the highest cost claims, which provide certainty to insurers and helps them actually price products for those other individuals in the risk pool so it should bring premiums down remarkably,\u201d  During the hearing,   \u201cOne of the keys to driving down rates in the individual market is to broaden the market and to get as many people as we can enrolled.\u201d Senator Collins asked Lori Wing-Heier, the Director of the Alaska Division of Insurance, to comment on whether allowing more people to purchase low-cost \u201ccopper\u201d health plans would help expand insurance coverage. \u201cWe believe that being able to have a catastrophic or copper plan available for a younger population is beneficial to growing the market and getting the healthier individuals in,\u201d   \u201cWe also think that it should probably be combined with a Health Savings Account.\u201d Senator Collins agreed that combining these low-cost health insurance plans with Health Savings Accounts would be a great way to help consumers pay for out-of-pocket costs.

That\u2019s the urgency of getting this bill across the finish line,\u2019 said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. \u201cAs chairwoman of the Senate Aging Committee,  The Senate on Thursday gave final approval to legislation to finance the Food and Drug Administration, clearing the measure for President Trump and tapping drug manufacturers once again to help pay for the federal review of prescription drugs and medical devices. The 94-to-1 vote came just hours after the Senate passed a separate bill expanding access to experimental treatments for people with terminal illnesses. This bill, the Right to Try Act, will now go to the House, where more than three dozen lawmakers have endorsed similar legislation. Mr. Trump is expected to sign the bill reauthorizing user fees to pay for the agency to review medical devices, brand-name drugs, generic drugs and biosimilars, which are copycat versions of costly biologic drugs made from living organisms. The House approved the user fee bill by voice vote on July 12. The vote capped an often frustrating seven months for Republicans, who hoped to churn out reams of conservative legislation with their control of both chambers and the White House. Since the dramatic failure of the Senate\u2019s health care repeal bill last week, lawmakers have seemed resigned to more incremental successes. \u201cWe\u2019re passing critical legislation. We\u2019re confirming nominees to important positions,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said from the Senate floor on Thursday, citing a series of veterans\u2019 bills and the confirmation this week of a new F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray. \u201cWe\u2019re taking steps in the right direction.\u201d Yet, even on their final day in session, lawmakers were reminded of the often uncomfortable marriage between Mr. Trump and the Republican-led Congress. Mr. Trump lashed out over a bill \u2014 which he signed grudgingly this week \u2014 to sanction Russia for meddling in last year\u2019s presidential election and for its aggression toward its neighbors. The legislation also limits Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to lift or suspend the sanctions himself. The measure, which the administration sought to block as it moved through the Capitol in recent weeks, is among the most significant accomplishments of this Congress. Some senators are also maneuvering in response to the White House\u2019s criticisms of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into ties between people in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit and Russia. On Thursday, Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, and Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, introduced legislation that would allow for judicial review if a special counsel was removed. The F.D.A. bill, which passed overwhelmingly in both houses, was a struggle, taking lawmakers more than a year to forge a consensus among Republicans, Democrats, F.D.A. officials and drug and device companies. \u201cThis is a bill that\u2019s been done the right way,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate health committee, in a subtle dig at Republican leaders who bypassed the committee and Democrats on their failed push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of the way the Senate is supposed to work.\u201d Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the committee, said, \u201cThis is really a great example of how Congress can actually work together on health issues and solve challenges.\u201d The food and drug agency depends on user fees to speed the approval of drugs while maintaining strict standards of drug safety. \u201cUser fees, where companies fund a portion of the premarket review of their products, account for more than a quarter of all F.D.A. funding, yet the F.D.A.\u2019s authority to collect these fees will expire at the end of next month unless Congress acts. That\u2019s the urgency of getting this bill across the finish line,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. The bill includes a proposal by Ms. Collins intended to prevent huge, unjustified cost increases on decades-old prescription medicines that have no competition. The legislation directs the agency to speed the review of generic drug applications when products on the market have little or no competition. As chairwoman of the Senate Aging Committee, Ms. Collins conducted a yearlong investigation that found \u201cegregious price spikes for certain off-patent drugs for which there were no generic competitors.\u201d The \u201cright-to-try bill,\u201d introduced by Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, aims to establish a new pathway for terminally ill patients to gain access to experimental drugs that have not been approved by the F.D.A. These patients are often extremely ill and unable to participate in clinical trials, or have no other treatment options. Under current law, drug companies can already provide access to patients outside of clinical trials under a program known as expanded access or compassionate use. The F.D.A. already approves about 99 percent of compassionate use requests. But companies sometimes refuse, fearing that the results could be used against them by the F.D.A. In some cases, drug makers fear they could be sued by patients who say they have been injured by unapproved drug products. The bill would establish national standards and rules to help channel drugs still under development to terminally ill patients. It also would shield pharmaceutical companies and doctors from some of the legal risks of providing drugs that have not been approved by the agency. Companies that manufacture such drugs and doctors who prescribe them would generally be protected unless they engaged in \u201creckless or willful misconduct\u201d or \u201cgross negligence,\u201d or intentionally harmed a patient. \u201cThese are real people facing their mortality with no hope,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThis right-to-try piece of legislation will give those individuals and families hope.\u201d Lawmakers and right-to-try advocates often say that terminally ill patients have nothing to lose. But those who oppose the bill say there is a difference between dying comfortably and dying horribly, suffering pain and other side effects of an unapproved drug. Patients seeking access to unapproved drugs often contact members of Congress and their aides, who in most cases do not have the medical background to determine whether a treatment is safe and effective."},
{"title": "Senators Collins, McCaskill\u2019s Plan to Improve Generic Drug Competition, Ensure Patient Access to Affordable Medication Heads to President's Desk", "date": ["Posted Fri, 08/04/2017 - 15:16"], "release": " \u2014 Provisions authored by U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO) to improve generic competition and lower the cost of prescription drugs cleared the Senate yesterday as part of the FDA Reauthorization Act. The provisions, which were unanimously adopted as an amendment during the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee\u2019s consideration of the legislation in May, will help foster a competitive marketplace to improve the affordability and accessibility of prescription drugs for patients. The House passed bipartisan legislation mirroring Senators Collins and McCaskill\u2019s plan  , and the bill will now head to the president\u2019s desk to be signed into law. \u201cDrug companies should not be able to increase their prices dramatically by thousands of percent overnight without any justification or development of the drug to improve its effectiveness, for example,\u201d    . \u201cOur legislation will help to foster a much healthier and more competitive marketplace as the best defense against such exploitation. I am pleased that our bipartisan plan will increase generic competition, which is so important to American families and particularly our seniors, who take a disproportionate number of the prescription drugs that are prescribed in this country.\u201d \u201cPrescription drugs aren\u2019t a luxury item\u2014for many, they\u2019re lifesavers, and Missouri families shouldn\u2019t have to choose between their prescriptions and their groceries,\u201d   \u201cWe\u2019ve got to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, and a fundamental way to do that is through generic competition. That\u2019s why this plan by Senator Collins and me will make a difference\u2014and why I\u2019m thrilled it\u2019s headed to the President\u2019s desk to be signed into law.\u201d In December 2015, Senators Collins and McCaskill, the Chairman and former Ranking Member of the Senate Aging Committee, launched the first ever bipartisan investigation into the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to egregious price spikes for certain drugs. Their investigation included a series of hearings that strived to understand why companies can make these large price increases and to identify which policies should be considered to counter these disturbing practices. In December 2016, Senators Collins and McCaskill   on drug pricing that detailed the Committee\u2019s findings. Senators Collins and McCaskill\u2019s bipartisan plan will   to foster a competitive marketplace to help keep drug prices down and improve access to affordable prescription drugs for Americans. These measures will enhance regulatory certainty for generic drug companies, prevent shortages, increase competition to lower prices and avoid monopolies, and deter practices that can lead to unjustifiable exorbitant price hikes."},
{"title": "Senators Collins and Tester Introduce Legislation to Address Doctor Shortages and Train Next Generation of Physicians", "date": ["Posted Mon, 08/07/2017 - 15:31"], "release": "\u00a0U.S. Senators Susan Collins (R-ME) and Jon Tester (D-MT) introduced the Training the Next Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act in response to the severe shortage of physicians that has reached crisis levels in a growing number of communities across the United States. Their bill would address this issue by reauthorizing and strengthening the successful Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program, which trains physicians in underserved, community-based settings. \u201cThis legislation would extend an important program to address the shortage of primary care doctors, which is especially critical in rural and underserved communities that are often those hardest hit by the opioid epidemic,\u201d   \u201cI urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation to help train the next generation of physicians and ensure all Americans have access to quality health services.\u201d \u201cDoctor shortages disproportionately impact rural communities and rural families,\u201d   \u201cBy getting more doctors into our rural hospitals and clinics we can provide a boost to rural America and ensure that folks living in in small towns aren\u2019t forced to endure dangerously long distances to see a doctor.\u201d \"The reauthorization and expansion of the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education (THCGME) Program is a critical step in providing healthcare to our citizens in rural areas, and I commend Senators Collins and Tester for their bipartisan leadership,\u201d   \u201cIt is well known that physicians, dentists, and other healthcare providers practice where they are trained. Providing training opportunities in underserved communities through the THCGME Program is an effective way to assure that people living in rural Maine and the millions of others living in underserved communities across America have access to the healthcare they need.\" By 2025, the United States is estimated to need more than 100,000 new physicians to meet the growing demand for health care services across the country. For the past six years the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program has worked to fill this gap. The program helps to train medical residents in community-based settings, including low-income, underserved rural and urban neighborhoods. Since 2011, the Penobscot Community Health Care Center has trained 31 residents and served more than 15,000 dental patients in Bangor, Maine. Medical education residents who train at teaching health centers are significantly more likely to remain in rural or underserved communities. The Training the Next Generation of Primary Care Doctors Act would reauthorize the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program for three years. It would also allow the expansion of new programs within existing teaching health centers as well as the creation of new centers to meet the growing need for community health services. The bill has gained support from numerous physician and medical education associations, including: The American Association of Teaching Health Centers; Senators Collins and Tester\u2019s legislation was cosponsored by Senators Thad Cochran (R-MS), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Steve Daines (R-MT), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and John Boozman (R-AR)."},

A transcript of the interview follows: JACKSON: Republican senator Susan Collins of Maine may have some, as well, for the president. She\u2019s joining us exclusively now. Senator, thank you for being with us here. COLLINS: Well, welcome to Bangor, Maine. JACKSON: I want to talk about what\u2019s going on in Washington, but I have to start with the news of the day, which is what is happening in Afghanistan. You have watched this war play out for 16 years. Are you confident that the president can execute some kind of a successful strategy, if it means increasing the number of troops on the ground? COLLINS: Well, we need to hear the strategy that the president is going to present tonight. I will say two things. And that is that in the past 16 years, our efforts in Afghanistan, which have cost the lives of so many troops, have lacked focus. There hasn't been a strategy. Second, we need a strategy that is going to deal with the influence of countries like Pakistan, like Iran, like Russia. JACKSON: So, if the president decides to stay the course, as he may do, is that enough for you? COLLINS: I\u2019m worried about that, because if you look at a map of Afghanistan, the Taliban has made enormous gains in the last couple of years. I don't want Afghanistan to be a safe haven for terrorist attacks the way that it was prior to the attacks on our country on 9/11. But this is a very difficult issue. And I\u2019m glad that there's been a detailed analysis of what to do. That\u2019s what we needed. JACKSON: I know you will be watching that address tonight as well as people across Maine. It will likely be in the front page tomorrow. What was in the front page today, I want to show you of the Bangor Daily News, and that is the protests over the weekend. Charlottesville and the aftermath of what happened there have been driving a lot of the conversation, and in the wake of that, your republican colleague, Senator Corker questioned President Trump's competency. Senator Tim Scott said the president had compromised his moral authority. What do you say about the president's response? COLLINS: The president had an obligation, a moral obligation to speak with absolute clarity from the very beginning. And stick with that to denounce the neo-Nazis, the white supremacists, the anti-Semitism that we heard, and unfortunately he wavered back and forth. There are no good neo-Nazis. JACKSON: What does that say to you about his leadership? COLLINS: In this case, I think the president failed to meet the standard that we would have expected a president to do in a time like that. There should be no place for hatred, bigotry and racism in this country. And he should have said that very clearly. He did at times, but then he wavered back and forth. JACKSON: Given your concerns about that, senator, at what point, though, given what we heard from your republican colleagues, does that talk turn into action? At what point, if any, do you not support his re-nomination? COLLINS: Well, I didn't support the president when he was our party's nominee. That was a very difficult position for me to take. I\u2019d never taken it before. Instead, I wrote in the name of Paul Ryan. And that was very hard to me to do as a lifelong republican. JACKSON: So what happens, he is already running for re-election, what is happening next? COLLINS: It is too early to tell now. There is a long ways between now and that point. JACKSON: Do you think he will end up the party's nominee in 2020? COLLINS: It\u2019s too difficult to say. JACKSON: Let me ask you about health care, because hat is something that was critical to the president on the campaign. You were one of the pivotal no votes on that. Let me ask you this, since there is still talk about this coming back up in the fall, is repeal and replace dead altogether? COLLINS: Repeal without a replacement that is workable, that doesn't hurt vulnerable people, and destroy the ability to a health care in rural America, I hope it's behind us. That does not mean that our job is done. There are serious problems with the Affordable Care Act. High premiums, the insurers fleeing the markets, so that even if you have a subsidy there is no policy that you can buy. And we're starting hearings in the Senate Health Committee in September to address those issues. JACKSON: So, to help stabilize the individual markets. Is that enough? Is that going to be the accomplishment you can point to when we talk on the December break? COLLINS: It\u2019s not enough. But it's an essential first step. I see a series of bills, where we address many of the problems that are associated with the ACA. JACKSON: You have been trying to work to lower prescription drug pricing, for example, which is an example for a lot of folks here in Maine. Is that an area where you see bipartisan consensus? COLLINS: I really hope so. I am so offended by an investigation that I conducted with Claire McCaskill last year on the Aging Committee, where we found that companies were buying these drugs from which the patent had expired and literally overnight hiking the cost of medicine by as much as 5,000%. We need to have a more competitive marketplace where generics are more readily available. And we're working with the FDA commissioner to do just that. JACKSON: Two more very quick questions for you. Are you satisfied with Senator McConnell\u2019s leadership on not just health care but and his response to President Trump and the way he's conducting his business? COLLINS: I don't always agree with Senator McConnell, but I think he has been a good and effective leader. JACKSON: You continue to back him as the leader of the Senate? COLLINS: I do. JACKSON: Opioid issues are, obviously, crucial here in Maine. If funding does come through for more prevention and help with people who are struggling with addiction, where does that go? COLLINS: We need a three-prong approach, and we need to focus on prevention education and focus on treatment, and we need to focus on enforcement, we need to do all three. The most painful statistic in Maine is 1,000 babies were born last year to addicted mothers. JACKSON: It\u2019s a powerful statistic and one that is hard to hear. Before I let you go, there is obviously a lot of political discussion about your role, your future here in Maine. Are you going to run for governor? COLLINS: I have not made a decision. On the one hand, a lot of seniority in the Senate, I\u2019m 15th and I started out at 99th. And I serve on the Appropriations Committee which has allowed me to do a lot of good for the people of Maine. On the other hand, governor is more hands-on. You can do more to create good jobs. So, I\u2019m weighing where I can do the most good for the people of Maine. JACKSON: Does the person in the White House affect your decision all? Does the fact that it's President Trump, who you would be working with as a senator, who you clearly have disagreements with, play in with your decision? COLLINS: No, not really. I want to evaluate where I can do the best for the people of Maine and I\u2019m taking in a lot of advice from people. JACKSON: Senator Collins I hope if and when you make that decision, you'll come back and share it with us. I appreciate you being here with us from Bangor, Maine, a place that you know well."},

Upward Bound helps low-income, first-generation, and other students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursue higher education. Earlier this year, due to a minor line spacing issue in UMPI\u2019s original application, the Department of Education prohibited UMPI\u2019s grant application from being reviewed, jeopardizing services to nearly 1,000 students. Following a months-long push led by Senator Collins, the Department of Education reversed this absurd bureaucratic decision and agreed to review UMPI\u2019s full application. \u201cI am absolutely delighted to announce that UMPI has been awarded more than $639,000 for its Upward Bound Program,\u201d   \u201cThe Department of Education\u2019s initial refusal to review this application due to a minor line spacing issue was absurd.

The first was an additional $50 million for TRIO for which Senator Collins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, successfully advocated   last year. The second was language   that \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d the Department \u201cto provide flexibility to [affected] applicants by permitting submission of a corrected application.\u201d Senator Collins worked tirelessly with other members of the Maine delegation and a bipartisan group of Senators to urge the Department of Education to overturn its initial rejection of dozens of Upward Bound applications. In addition to securing additional money for TRIO and pressing for action in the Omnibus, Senator Collins joined Senator King and Representatives Poliquin and Pingree   to Secretary DeVos on April 14th to express their strong concern with the Department\u2019s decision. Moreover, on April 28th, Senator Collins and Senator Jon Tester (D-MT)  signed by 25 Senators, including Senator King, urging the Department of Education to read and score these grant applications.

In May, the senators introduced the bipartisan  , which would increase addiction treatment services to help combat the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic by modifying the IMD Exclusion \u2013 an arcane policy created in 1965 that limits Medicaid coverage for substance abuse treatment to facilities with less than 16 beds.\u00a0 The   would lift this outdated barrier by expanding Medicaid coverage to pay for up to 40 treatment beds within larger substance abuse treatment facilities.\u00a0 In July, the President\u2019s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis issued a preliminary report calling for an emergency waiver from the IMD Exclusion, calling it \u201cthe single fastest way to increase treatment availability across the nation.\u201d \u00a0 said the members.

Senators Collins and Shaheen have consistently worked to increase funding for diabetes research and promote better health care for people with diabetes. Insulin-dependent Medicare beneficiaries rely on therapies such as patch pumps, which provide continuous insulin delivery without the need for tubes, to help manage their disease. While such treatments are covered by private insurance, Medicare does not cover these devices. As a result, individuals with diabetes may lose coverage for the physician-prescribed therapies they have been successfully using to manage their diabetes when they age into Medicare. \u201cEffective management of diabetes is crucial to holding down health care costs and helping seniors manage their diabetes successfully to allow them to continue to live healthy and productive lives,\u201d   \u201cWe urge your careful review of Medicare coverage policies for patch pumps and other life-saving therapies for diabetes, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and to review the procedures at CMS that have resulted in these disparities in coverage.\u201d Diabetes affects nearly 30 million Americans nationwide, and it has been estimated that the number of Americans living with this disease will double and the related health care costs will nearly triple by 2035.

The hearing was the first in a four-part series on short-term insurance market stabilization. Senator Collins has consistently championed a bipartisan process to begin fixing the flaws in the Affordable Care Act so that it will work better for all Americans. State insurance commissioners have extensive hands-on experience and practical insight that will be invaluable to the Committee as it works to develop commonsense policies to improve the health insurance market. Senator Collins served as the commissioner of the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation, which oversaw the Maine Bureau of Insurance, from 1987-1992. Senator Collins told Julie Mix McPeak, the Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, about Maine\u2019s success at lowering premiums through a resinsurance program that ended when the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges opened. She asked Ms. McPeak about the feasibility of the federal government providing technical and financial assistance to help states replicate Maine\u2019s achievement. \u201cWe heard today of the success of the reinsurance pool that Alaska set up. Similarly, Maine between 2012 and 2013 had a reinsurance pool that was successful in lowering rates in the individual market by 20 percent on average,\u201d   \u201cSo I think when you look at the experience of those two states alone it shows the benefit of reinsurance pools.\u201d \u201cI do believe that the reinsurance mechanism or a high-risk pool, either one, has the effect of removing from the risk pool the highest cost claims, which provide certainty to insurers and helps them actually price products for those other individuals in the risk pool so it should bring premiums down remarkably,\u201d  During the hearing,   \u201cOne of the keys to driving down rates in the individual market is to broaden the market and to get as many people as we can enrolled.\u201d Senator Collins asked Lori Wing-Heier, the Director of the Alaska Division of Insurance, to comment on whether allowing more people to purchase low-cost \u201ccopper\u201d health plans would help expand insurance coverage. \u201cWe believe that being able to have a catastrophic or copper plan available for a younger population is beneficial to growing the market and getting the healthier individuals in,\u201d   \u201cWe also think that it should probably be combined with a Health Savings Account.\u201d Senator Collins agreed that combining these low-cost health insurance plans with Health Savings Accounts would be a great way to help consumers pay for out-of-pocket costs. In addition to today's hearing with state insurance commissioners, the Senate Health Committee will meet on September 7 to hear from governors, September 12 to hear from health policy experts on state flexibility, and September 14 to hear from a state insurance commissioner, doctors, and patient advocates."},

Direct Support Professionals (DSPs) are an invaluable part of our nation's health care system, caring for the most vulnerable Americans, including the chronically ill, seniors, and those living with a disability.

Unfortunately, direct support professionals are often forced to leave the jobs they love due to low wages and excessive, difficult, work hours. Many Direct Support Professionals rely on public benefits, and some must work multiple jobs in order to provide for themselves and their families. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we work to ensure that these hard-working individuals have the income and emotional support they need and deserve.

Senator Collins also answered questions on a wide range of topics from MSNBC economic analyst and former treasury official Steve Rattner,   reporter Yamiche Alcindor, and MSNBC political analyst Steve Schmidt. A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cMorning Joe\u201d October 16, 2017 MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: And, Senator Collins joins us now. It is great to have you on the show. Thank you for being on this morning. SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R) MAINE: Thank you. BRZEZINSKI: So what was behind the decision to stay in? COLLINS: It was a very difficult decision. The attraction of being in Maine full-time, close to much of my family and many of my friends was very strong. And governor, it's a far more hands-on job where you can really make a difference on issues like providing more economic opportunities. But in the end, I decided that the issues right now in Washington are so consequential. They're so huge. And I am a person who likes to work across the aisle and builds bipartisan coalitions, and that's what I decided I wanted to do. In the end, it came down to where I could do more for my state and my country. BRZEZINSKI: Joe -- JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: I remember -- Sen. Collins, Joe Scarborough here. I remember talking to Sen. McCain in January or February and saying, \u201cIt's extraordinary. Of all the sacrifices you've made for this country, this may be your greatest contribution right now because there's so much chaos in Washington.\u201d Do you feel like what you are doing right now is as substantial and as important as anything you've done in your decades of public service? COLLINS: I really do. These are chaotic times in Washington and Washington reflects the division and the discord that we see throughout our country. The polarization has never been greater. And yet, I remain a congenital optimist that as the pendulum will swing back and if those of us who are in the middle leave, I worry who will lead that effort to bring us back and get things done for the American people in a way that is less partisan and that invites input by both Republicans and Democrats. I would say, however, I would never begin to compare myself to John McCain, who has done so much for our country. STEVE RATTNER, MSNBC ECONOMIC ANALYST, FORMER TREASURY OFFICIAL: Senator, it's Steve Rattner. As you well know, there are more than a dozen things the president has done in the last few months that are likely to diminish enrollments in the ACA or otherwise impede people getting health care. You've spoken out against some of them. I assume you're probably unhappy with most all of them. But what, if anything, can you do to actually change the course of what's happening and try to preserve health care that is in jeopardy for millions of Americans at the moment? COLLINS: What we should do is immediately pass legislation that's been negotiated by Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray, who heads the Senate Health Committee, which I'm a member of, which would help to lower premiums, stabilize the markets, and give clear authorization for the cost-saving reductions that are essential to help low-income people pay their out-of-pocket costs. And that's a package that I believe can garner support on both sides of the aisle, and I hope that the president would sign it into law. BRZEZINSKI: Yamiche -- YAMICHE ALCINDOR, REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Senator Collins, I want to ask you about being a woman on the hill. Yesterday, I was talking to some colleagues about the culture on the hill and with Harvey Weinstein, and we're talking all about the culture of Hollywood and women essentially being sexually assaulted or sexually harassed. Have you heard about that culture in D.C.? Have you, yourself, experienced anything like that? And what do you say to people who say Capitol Hill might need to look at its own culture? COLLINS: It's always good for an organization to review its own culture to make sure that equality and justice prevail throughout. I have not experienced that but undoubtedly, we know from some press accounts that it has happened before. And it is reprehensible, regardless of the working environment in which it occurs. Regardless of whether it's Hollywood or Washington or Main Street America. And I believe that these brave women coming forth and confronting one of the most powerful individuals in Hollywood will help others speak out about their experience and send a very clear message that this is not tolerated. I will say that I do think that when women are elected to the United States Senate that we do face an extra barrier that men do not. When a man is elected to the Senate it's assumed that he belongs there. My experience has been that we women have to prove that we belong there and once we do that we're accepted. But there is an extra barrier that I've found. BRZEZINSKI: Interesting. Steve Schmidt -- STEVE SCHMIDT, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Senator, good morning. Your colleague, Bob Corker, a man -- serious, sober, not given to hyperbole -- has talked quite critically, quite openly about this administration worrying about the president's capacity to start World War III. We have the secretary of state talking about the negotiations will continue until the first bombs drop. How concerned are you and how legitimate do you find Sen. Corker's criticism behaviorally of this administration? How worried are you? COLLINS: Let me say first that I'm a friend of Bob Corker's. I think he's an excellent senator and a great leader of the Foreign Committee, and he knows a great deal. I don't think the Twitter war between him and the president is productive and I'd like to see them get back to working on the Iran legislation, for example. But there's no doubt that this president's been extremely unconventional in his approach and that has caused more chaos than I think is good for our country and for our relationship with both our allies and our enemies. I would urge the president to remember that every single word that he says matters. When he was in the private sector and the business world, he could make an off-the-hand comment, and it really didn't matter. Even as a candidate, it could be excused because he was running for political office. But he is now President of the United States of America, and every word that he says counts. And that's why I'd encourage him to be more careful with his rhetoric because of the signal\u2014the inadvertent signal\u2014that it may send not only to Americans but to our adversaries and our allies around the world. BRZEZINSKI: For sure. Senator Susan Collins, thank you so much."},

This month is dedicated to those who have been stricken with Alzheimer\u2019s, their family members and other devoted caregivers, and to the medical professionals and researchers who are working to advance our understanding of the disease, find an effective treatment, and, ultimately, discover a cure and a means of prevention. Alzheimer\u2019s disease is one of the greatest under-recognized public health threats of our time.\u00a0 Five and a half million Americans are living with the disease, including 27,000 here in Maine, and that number is soaring as our overall population grows older and lives longer.\u00a0 In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer\u2019s is our nation\u2019s costliest disease.\u00a0 The United States spends more than $259 billion per year, including $175 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid.\u00a0 By 2050, if we continue along this trajectory, costs are projected to increase to more than $1.1 trillion, and the number of Americans living with Alzheimer\u2019s is expected to reach 16 million.\u00a0 While Alzheimer\u2019s is the only one of our nation\u2019s most deadly diseases without an effective treatment or cure, new research is showing that there are actions we can take to promote prevention and improve treatment.\u00a0 The first step we should take is to recognize Alzheimer\u2019s as a public health crisis.\u00a0 I have introduced bipartisan legislation, the Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer\u2019s Act, to create a public health infrastructure to combat Alzheimer\u2019s disease and preserve brain health through early detection and diagnosis as well as improved treatment and care. It is because of public health advancements that we have safe water to drink, vaccines to prevent deadly diseases, and emergency preparedness tools to save lives.\u00a0 Using a public health approach, there is potential to change the trajectory of Alzheimer\u2019s. The effort to overcome Alzheimer\u2019s disease through a unified national effort is gaining traction.\u00a0 In 1999, when I founded the Bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer\u2019s, there was virtually no focus in Washington on this disease.\u00a0 In fact, people were afraid to say the word \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s,\u201d just as \u2013 years ago \u2013 people didn\u2019t talk about cancer.\u00a0 Seven years ago, I co-authored the bipartisan National Alzheimer\u2019s Project Act, which set the primary goal of preventing and effectively treating the disease by 2025.\u00a0 That legislation created an expert council, which has calculated that $2 billion per year is needed to achieve that goal. On the Appropriations Committee, I worked to turn the words of that recommendation into action.\u00a0 The proposed funding bill for the upcoming fiscal year provides a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health that includes a $414 million increase for Alzheimer\u2019s research, the largest in history.\u00a0 That brings the total for Alzheimer\u2019s research to $1.8 billion \u2013 well within reach of our $2 billion goal.\u00a0 While research is moving forward, we must also put in practice what we know about prevention, and enhance the quality of care and support for those living with Alzheimer\u2019s and their families.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on families and communities.\u00a0 The BOLD Act, which I have introduced, would establish Centers of Excellence in Public Health Practice to promote better treatment and care for those living with Alzheimer\u2019s.\u00a0 The Centers would also educate the public on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, cognitive decline, and brain health.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 My legislation would also help communities across America to combat Alzheimer\u2019s. \u00a0The legislation would direct the CDC to establish and distribute awards of funding to local public health departments to support Americans living with Alzheimer\u2019s and their caregivers.\u00a0 The awards of funding would also be used to educate Americans about ways to reduce the risk of memory loss, and other symptoms that can happen before Alzheimer\u2019s strikes.\u00a0 Finally, at the heart of public health is data.\u00a0 This legislation would direct CDC to collect data to help us better understand the trends in cognitive decline, cognitive impairment, and caregiving.\u00a0 The data would be shared with the public and used to improve brain health. For far too long we have viewed Alzheimer\u2019s as an aging issue that plagues some seniors today and threatens to affect many more tomorrow.\u00a0 New research finds that, in fact, Alzheimer\u2019s is a public health issue with a course that we can change.\u00a0 The BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer\u2019s Act would create a new enlightened public policy out of promising research.\u00a0 It would dramatically change the way we think of the disease, and ultimately, it has the potential to save millions of lives.\u00a0"},

Freedom is more than the name of that lovely Waldo County community; it is its heritage.\u00a0 The first settler in 1794 was Stephen Smith, a patriot who fought for freedom in the Revolutionary War.\u00a0 The town was incorporated during the War of 1812, the first challenge to our young nation\u2019s freedom.\u00a0 In 1863, with the Civil War raging, a young man from Freedom named Daniel Davis left school and joined the 1  Maine Cavalry Regiment so that the blessing of freedom would be extended to all Americans.\u00a0 In 1880, he became Maine\u2019s 37  Governor. On Veterans Day 2017, the people of Freedom paid tribute to their family members, friends, and neighbors who served in our time.\u00a0 The celebration coincided with the 98  birthday of Roy Ward, the town\u2019s oldest citizen, whose courageous Navy service during World War II inspires us today. While Freedom\u2019s history is unique, the virtues it describes unite our great nation.\u00a0 It is estimated that some 48 million Americans have served in uniform since the founding of our nation.\u00a0 Today, more than 20 million veterans live among us, more than 116,000 right here in Maine. \u00a0To put that in perspective, Maine has more veterans per capita than all but two of the other states in the country.\u00a0 We are proud of our State\u2019s contributions to protecting our nation. Those numbers are impressive not only because of their sheer size, but also because they describe the history of a people united by the highest ideals of humanity.\u00a0 Those numbers are not cold statistics.\u00a0 Each one tells a story of courage, sacrifice, and devotion to duty. On Veterans Day, we honor those who paid the ultimate price, whether they lie at rest in foreign lands or in their hometowns.\u00a0 We honor those who lived beyond their years of military service but who have since passed on.\u00a0 We honor those who remain missing and pledge that they never will be forgotten.\u00a0 And we honor those veterans who are with us today.\u00a0 We owe them all a great debt.\u00a0 We also honor the parents, the wives and husbands, the children and other loved ones of our veterans and our troops.\u00a0 The families left behind face the challenges of daily living as they endure separation and worry.\u00a0 Their sacrifices are great, and we owe them much as well. It is the American character to answer the call of duty.\u00a0 It also is the American character to be grateful to those who answer that call.\u00a0 One has only to look at the Maine Troop Greeters, who have greeted some 1.5 million troops at the Bangor Airport, to know how much the people of our State value our service members.\u00a0 They treat our veterans with similar generosity and a spirit of caring. We owe our veterans so much, and repay that debt in part, but only in part, with the gratitude we express on Veterans Day.\u00a0 As a nation, we must also repay our debt with the health care, rehabilitation services, and educational and employment opportunities our veterans have earned through their service to our country.\u00a0 I am committed to ensuring that the government keeps that sacred obligation.\u00a0 Initiatives I have undertaken in the Senate this year to help ensure that veterans receive the quality, accessible health care and other benefits they earned through their service include the bipartisan   that would expand a successful program that helps those who care for wounded, ill, or injured veterans at home.\u00a0 Being in the Town of Freedom on Veterans Day brought to mind one of my earliest childhood memories -- going with my father, a World War II veteran, to the patriotic parades in my hometown of Caribou.\u00a0 He hoisted me high on his shoulders, and from the best vantage point along the route, I saw hats go off and hands go over hearts as Caribou paid its respects to our flag and honored our veterans for their service to our country. Our veterans provide all of us with an inspiring view from strong shoulders.\u00a0 From that vantage point, we see that the burden of service must be borne willingly and with modesty.\u00a0 We see that challenges must be met and that threats must be confronted.\u00a0 And we see that we have an obligation to always respect, honor, and support those who make that view possible."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cState of the Union\u201d November 19, 2017 TAPPER: And joining us now is Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine. Senator, I want to get to taxes in a moment, but I do want to start with the Alabama Senate race where Republican nominee Roy Moore has been accused of sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl, sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl. You've urged Moore to withdrawal from the race, but you also said that if he wins, the Senate would have, quote, no choice but to seat him. I do wonder, though, if Moore is elected, I understand he would have to be seated, but would you want the Senate to vote to expel him? COLLINS: It's too early for me to say what the Ethics Committee recommendation would be. And obviously I came out against Roy Moore very early, in fact before these terrible allegations were levied against him, because I was concerned about his performance as a member of the Alabama Supreme Court, where he had been removed twice for failing to follow lawful orders and also because of his comments on Muslims and LGBT individuals. So, these allegations are extremely disturbing. But under the Constitution, the test on whether or not you seat someone is whether they satisfy the age and residency requirements. So, we would have to seat him, but I hope we don't get there. I think we're getting ahead of ourselves. And I hope that the voters of Alabama choose not to elect him. TAPPER: Would you rather serve with Doug Jones, the Democrat, than with Roy Moore? COLLINS: I don't know Doug Jones at all, but I've never supported Roy Moore. And I hope that he does not end up being in the United States Senate. TAPPER: And just to be clear, and then we'll move on from Roy Moore, you believe the women? You think that these are credible allegations that he assaulted -- sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl and sexually molested a 14-year-old girl? COLLINS: I do. I read his explanation. I listened to his radio interview. And I did not find his denials to be convincing at all. So, from my perspective, these are credible allegations against him. TAPPER: Now, the White House has not commented on whether the allegations are credible, but President Trump did attack Senator Al Franken after the allegations against him. They were asked, the White House, this week, why are the allegations between -- against Franken different from the allegations -- multiple allegations from at least 13 different women against President Trump. Listen to how the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, answered. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SARAH SANDERS: Specifically, Senator Franken has admitted wrongdoing and the president hasn't. I think that's a very clear distinction. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: It's kind of an odd thing to say in some ways. Do you buy the notion that Trump's accusers are not credible because the president denies the allegations? COLLINS: I did not support President Trump. He was not my candidate for president. And part of the reason why were allegations about how he treated women. I made my decision before the Hollywood Access tape came out. But I was not a supporter of President Trump for the Republican nomination. TAPPER: Let's turn to taxes. You said this week that Republicans made a big mistake when they changed the tax bill to include this repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate because that -- removing that could raise taxes or payment -- health care payments, premiums, for millions of Americans. If that provision stays in the tax bill, will that mean a \"no\" vote from you? COLLINS: Well, first of all, I think we need to distinguish between taking away insurance from people who already have it, which is what the health care bills that we considered earlier this year would have done, versus removing a fine on people who choose not to have insurance. And that fine falls disproportionately\u201480 percent\u2014on those who make under $50,000. I don't think that provision should be in the bill. I hope the Senate will follow the lead of the House and strike it. If not, I think we need to fix it by passing two bills, the Alexander-Murray bill, which will help to stabilize markets and reduce premiums, and a bill I've introduced with Bill Nelson of Florida that would create high-risk pools that would protect people with pre-existing conditions and also help to reduce premiums by 20 percent. TAPPER: You say that you have data show that the premium increase will outweigh any tax cut that a middle-income person might get from this tax bill. If that data point doesn't change -- I just want to drill in on this point -- will you have to vote \"no\" if there isn't the relief that you're looking for, either by tinkering with this bill or through the legislation you just offered? COLLINS: The bill's going to be subject to amendment on the Senate floor, and I'm filing amendments myself, in part to provide more relief to middle-income families and to deal with the very problem that you have identified. The fact is that if you do pull this piece of the Affordable Care Act out, for some middle-income families, the increased premium is going to cancel out the tax cut that they would get. And that's why it's so important that we pass the two pieces of legislation that I talked about. And it's also why we need to restore the tax deduction for state and local taxes, the way that the House did. That will help our middle-income taxpayers get more tax relief. I also want to keep the tax rate at right where it is, at 39.6 percent for people who are making $1 million or more a year, rather than lowering it, as the Senate bill would do. TAPPER: Senator Orrin Hatch, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, got angry at Democrats this week for suggesting that this tax bill is a give-a-way to the rich. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ORRIN HATCH: I really resent anybody saying that I'm just doing this for the rich. Give me a break. SEN. SHERROD BROWN: How many times do we do this before we (INAUDIBLE) -- SEN. ORRIN HATCH: Listen, I've honored you by allowing you to spout off here. And what you said was not right. (END VIDEO CLIP) TAPPER: Let's drill down on the -- on the actual issue that they're debating here. Based on the numbers you've seen, does this tax bill benefit the rich more than it does the middle class? COLLINS: It benefits people of all tax brackets. But what I want to do is to skew more of that relief to middle and low-income families.\u00a0 The Senate bill starts to do that. It doubles the child care -- the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and it also makes part of it refundable to very low-income individuals who don't pay any tax at all. It doubles the standard deduction so that a couple making $24,000 would pay no income tax at all. So, I don't think those allegations are fair. But nevertheless, there are provisions of the bill that I would like to see changed. And keeping that top rate for individuals where it is, for people making more than $1 million is one change. And I would also like to see the business taxes, which do need to be reduced, in order to incentivize the creation of good jobs and higher wages in this country, but it does not need to be reduced all the way to 20 percent for large businesses. TAPPER: All right, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, always a pleasure to have you on. Thank you so much. COLLINS: Thank you, Jake."},

A transcript of the interview follows: \u201cThis Week\u201d November 19, 2017 GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, HOST: Want to continue it now with Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine. Senator Collins, thank you for joining us this morning. You just heard our panel right there. Weigh in, please. Do you think this is a moment where we're going to see real change? SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE: I do. But I thought that there was one aspect that hasn't been discussed. And that is that the women who bring forth these allegations are often trashed. They're attacked. Their credibility is undermined. We saw that with some of President Clinton's accusers. We know the elaborate attempts that Harvey Weinstein went to in order to discredit his accusers. And that has to stop, as well. STEPHANOPOULOS: And we see -- we saw just recently both -- we're seeing it right now. You mentioned President Clinton. And it certainly did happen then. We also see Roy Moore now calling all of his accusers liars. President Trump, more than a dozen women came forward during the campaign\u00a0 He says that every single one of them are lying. COLLINS: He did say that. And, President Trump was not my choice for the Republican nominee for president. And, I did not support him in part because of the way that all of these reports about how he was treating women. He is president now. And, I am working with him on some issues. But those allegations remain very disturbing. STEPHANOPOULOS: Can you work with Roy Moore? If he gets elected, should he be investigated? Will you vote to expel? COLLINS: Well, first of all, my hope is that we won't get to that point, and that the voters of Alabama will not elect Roy Moore. I've read his denials. I've listened to his radio interview. And I did not find him to be credible. As more and more allegations come forward, that adds to the weight of evidence against him. I believe, based on my reading of the Constitution, that if he is elected that we have no choice but to seat him. Then, however, the Ethics Committee could have an investigation. And since I essentially would be a juror, if that happens, I'm not going to comment on what could happen as a result of that investigation. But, I hope that the good voters of Alabama decide not to send him to the United States Senate. STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Al Franken is also going to be subject to an Ethics investigation. You can't comment on that either? COLLINS: Well, first, let me say that I believe the allegations and Al Franken has essentially admitted to them. I'm talking about what the outcome would be if the Ethics Committee proceeds with an investigation, which I believe the Ethics Committee is going to do so. But I did find the allegations against him to be both credible, disgusting, and appalling, and degrading to women. STEPHANOPOULOS: Let's move on to the tax bill. Passed the Senate Finance Committee this week. And a separate tax bill passed the House as well. You're already facing ads back in your home state by a group called \"Not One Penny.\" Let's take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED: It's hard enough for Mainers to find our way in this economy. But the Trump Republican tax plan would leave us lost in the wilderness just to pay for huge tax cuts for the wealthiest. Thankfully, Senator Susan Collins told us that she would say no to tax breaks for the wealthiest. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANOPOULOS: Can you vote for the bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee? COLLINS: I want to see changes in that bill. And I think there will be changes. There are some provisions of the House bill that I like better. For example, the House retains the top rate of 39.6 percent for people who make $1 million or more a year. That's a change that I would like to see be made in the Senate bill so that we can skew more of the relief to middle-income taxpayers. So, some very good provisions in the Senate bill such as the doubling of the child tax credit and making it refundable for people of low income. There\u2019s also a doubling of the standard deduction, which means that a family making $24,000 would not pay any income tax. So, there are provisions of both bills that I like. But I think the bill needs work. STEPHANOPOULOS: You can't vote for it as written? COLLINS: I haven't reached that conclusion yet, because I think there are going to be further changes. But the biggest mistake was putting in a provision from the Affordable Care Act into the Senate bill that is not in the House bill. And I hope that will be dropped or, that bills have been introduced by Senators Alexander and Murray and Bill Nelson and myself will be adopted to mitigate the impact of those provisions. STEPHANOPOULOS: That provision was put in at the insistence of the president. He was tweeting about it last week. He seems to think that it's the best way to both save some money and to get some of the partial repeal of Obamacare. So, if it stays in the bill, are you against the bill? COLLINS: It's a problem for me if it is not mitigated. But there is a way to mitigate the impact that it would have on insurance premiums. I do want to point out that that provision, all that provision says is that a person who chooses not to get insurance cannot be fined for that decision. That's very different from what we were faced with this past summer and fall when insurance was being taken away from people who wanted to be insured. The fact is that those fines are paid by -- overwhelmingly by people who make less than $50,000 a year, 80 percent of the people who pay the fines fall in that category. But I'm worried about the impact on premiums. And that's why we're going to need to pass legislation. And I would like to see that done before we go to the tax bill. STEPHANOPOULOS: And unlikely the Democrats are going to support doing that before the tax bill. One other feature of the Senate tax bill is that the corporate tax cuts are permanent, yet the individual tax cuts are temporary. COLLINS: Again, that's not a provision that I like. The House made both of them permanent. I think that is a far better way to go. I also think the reduction in the business tax rate is too steep, and that we could go to 22 percent, and then use that money, which is about $200 billion, to restore the tax deduction for state and local property taxes. That would really help middle-income taxpayers. STEPHANOPOULOS: Sounds like you still have a lot of questions about this bill. One other feature pointed out by the Congressional Budget Office this week is that if this bill passes, with the increase in the deficit that it accommodates, over $1.5 trillion, there will be at least $25 billion in Medicare cuts next year. COLLINS: I have talked to my colleagues about that, because that's obviously something that I cannot support. I do believe that's going to be dealt with as part of the budget negotiations that are ongoing right now. There are ways to reform our entitlement programs, but that is not one of them. The whole idea of across-the-board cuts or sequestration, or offsets that affect some of our most vulnerable citizens or our seniors is not something that I can support. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, Senator Collins, listening to you today, it looks like that bill is going to have to change an awful lot before it can get your support. Thank you for joining us this morning. COLLINS: Thank you, George."},

{"title": "From the Senate Floor,   Senator Collins Urges Colleagues to Support Amendments She Introduced to Support Tax Relief for the Middle Class", "date": ["Posted Thu, 11/30/2017 - 16:02"], "release": "U.S. Senator Susan Collins spoke from the Senate floor this afternoon to urge her colleagues to support four amendments she introduced to the Senate tax reform bill that would strengthen the legislation in important ways for middle-income Americans.\u00a0 \u201cBy reforming our nation\u2019s tax code, we can reduce the tax burden on hardworking Americans and help spur job creation and economic growth,\u201d  \u00a0 \u201cMy amendments would improve upon the Senate\u2019s current tax reform proposal by allowing filers to deduct state and local property taxes, protecting retirement benefits for employees of nonprofit organizations and local governments, making the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit refundable, and reducing the threshold for deducting medical expenses.\u00a0 These amendments would provide essential tax relief for many middle-class families in Maine and across the country.\u201d Senator Collins\u2019 first amendment would allow taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes.\u00a0 In recent years more than 95 percent of all itemizers, and 28 percent of all federal income tax filers, deducted state and local taxes, including property taxes.\u00a0 Yet, the Senate bill would eliminate this deduction altogether.\u00a0 This deduction is especially important to Maine, where 166,000 itemizers deducted a total of $725 million in property taxes on their federal income tax returns each year.\u00a0 Senator Collins\u2019 amendment would allow the vast majority of Mainers who itemize to fully deduct their property taxes. The second amendment Senator Collins introduced would strike a provision that could reduce the retirement benefits of church, charity, school, and government employees, including firefighters, teachers, and police officers.\u00a0 As drafted, the Senate bill would eliminate critical tax rules that allow employees of nonprofits and local governments to make additional \u201ccatch-up\u201d and \u201cmake up\u201d contributions to their retirement accounts during and near the end of their careers.\u00a0 This amendment would protect these special rules to ensure those employees who serve the public achieve greater retirement security. Senator Collins\u2019 third amendment would improve the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit by making it refundable, thus providing much-needed assistance to low-income working families.\u00a0 This would help many families afford high-quality child care or adult day care for older parents or other relatives who can no longer care for themselves. Finally, Senator Collins introduced an amendment that would lower the threshold for Americans to deduct medical expenses.\u00a0 Currently, due to a provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), consumers can deduct medical expenses only if they exceed 10 percent of their income.\u00a0\u00a0 Senator Collins\u2019 amendment would restore the threshold to 7.5 percent, the level prior to the ACA, to help all taxpayers, and particularly seniors, who are struggling with high medical costs."},
{"title": "Senator Collins\u2019 Statement in Support of Senate Tax Reform Bill", "date": ["Posted Fri, 12/01/2017 - 14:56"], "release": "U.S. Senator Susan Collins announced today that, after securing significant changes, she will support  , the first major overhaul of our nation\u2019s tax code since 1986. She released the following statement: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a single American who thinks that our current tax code is fair, simple, or promotes economic growth.\u00a0 We need a tax system that will boost the economy, help the middle class, and encourage small businesses to grow and create jobs.\u00a0 If we stimulate the economy through tax reform, we can significantly increase federal revenues while boosting Americans\u2019 take-home pay.\u00a0 \u201cBy nearly doubling the standard deduction and expanding the child tax credit, this bill will provide significant relief to lower- and middle-income taxpayers. For example, a single mother with one child earning $35,000 will see her taxes drop by nearly 4,000 percent. Instead of paying money to Washington, she will be getting more than $1,100 back each year to help her make ends meet.\u00a0 \u201cOver the past several weeks, I have worked to ensure that the Senate bill includes a number of important changes. \u201cFirst, I advocated strongly for restoring the state and local property tax deduction up to $10,000, a critical provision that will provide much-needed tax relief for hard-working, middle-income families.\u00a0 Passage of my amendment will allow the vast majority of Mainers who itemize to fully deduct their property tax bill. In Maine, 166,000 taxpayers who itemize deduct a total of $725 million in property taxes on their federal income tax returns.\u00a0 This is often the largest deduction taken by Mainers. In fact, Mainers have the 11  highest per capita property tax burden in the nation.\u00a0 \u201cSecond, my amendment to help Americans struggling with high unreimbursed health care costs was incorporated into the bill.\u00a0 I am pleased that the final bill will include my amendment to lower the threshold for claiming the deduction for these unreimbursed expenses from 10 percent to 7.5 percent of income for two years.\u00a0 The House bill eliminated this long-standing deduction used by 8.8 million Americans \u2013 nearly half of whom make less than $50,000 per year.\u00a0 A harmful provision of the Affordable Care Act had increased the threshold to 10 percent of income. Lowering the threshold will provide relief for those experiencing particularly high health care costs, including seniors and those with pre-existing conditions.  \u201cThird, I\u2019m pleased that my amendment to reverse the Senate bill\u2019s ill-advised elimination of catch-up contributions to retirement accounts for church, charity, school, and public employees was adopted. My amendment will help protect these employees \u2013 including firefighters, school teachers, and police officers \u2013 by striking provisions in the Senate bill that would have reduced their ability to save for retirement.\u00a0 These first responders and other public servants should not have their standard of living in retirement diminished because they chose to work in public service. \u201cIn addition, I was deeply concerned that the repeal of the individual mandate would almost certainly lead to further increases in the cost of health insurance premiums \u2013 premiums that are already too expensive under the ACA.\u00a0  \u00a0 The first, the Bipartisan Health Care Stabilization Act introduced by Senators Alexander and Murray, will provide vital funding in 2019 and 2020 for the cost-sharing reductions received by low-income enrollees in the ACA exchanges.\u00a0 This funding helps low-income families pay their out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles and co-pays. The second is bipartisan legislation I introduced that would protect people with pre-existing conditions while lowering premiums through the use of high-risk pools.\u00a0 This plan will provide $5 billion annually for two years in seed money for states to establish invisible high-risk pools or traditional reinsurance programs. We know from experiences in the states of Maine and Alaska that high-risk pools can help to lower premiums substantially \u2013 by an average of 20 percent.\u00a0 \u201cI have also heard a great deal of concern from seniors with the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s determination that an automatic four percent cut to Medicare, estimated to be roughly $25 billion for fiscal year 2018, could be triggered by the passage of this legislation as a result of the Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) even though there is no intention for such a reduction to occur.\u00a0 Medicare provides essential benefits to our nation\u2019s seniors, and any reduction in funding triggered in this way would be completely unacceptable.\u00a0   urging that we immediately remove the threat of an automatic cut in the program\u2019s funding, which has been done on numerous occasions before, and  . \u201cHaving secured these key improvements in the bill, as well as the commitments to legislation to help lower health insurance premiums, I will cast my vote in support of the Senate tax reform bill. As revised, this bill will provide much-needed tax relief and simplification for lower- and middle-income families, while spurring the creation of good jobs and greater economic growth.\u201d"}
